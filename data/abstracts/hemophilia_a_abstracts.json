    "abstract": "NXT007 is a bispecific antibody that mimics the cofactor function of activated factor (F)VIII and was engineered by modifying emicizumab. Nonclinical investigations suggested its potential to provide non-hemophilic levels of coagulation activity to people with hemophilia A (PwHA). A first-in-human, single-ascending-dose study of NXT007 was conducted in healthy Japanese male adults (Part A of the NXTAGE study). To evaluate safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NXT007. Forty participants were enrolled across five cohorts and randomized to receive a single subcutaneous injection of NXT007 (n=6 per cohort; 0.0018, 0.0054, 0.018, 0.054, or 0.18 mg/kg) or placebo (n=2 per cohort). There were no dose-dependent increases in the incidence of adverse events (AEs), and no thrombotic events or injection-site reactions were reported. One serious AE of erythema was reported in a participant who received NXT007 0.0054 mg/kg, and its causality to NXT007 could not be ruled out. Nine participants developed anti-NXT007 antibodies (ADAs); all were considered to be associated with faster clearance of NXT007 without impacting safety. NXT007 exposure increased dose-dependently but less than dose-proportionally. The elimination half-life of NXT007 was approximately 10 weeks in ADA-negative participants. With ex vivo neutralization of endogenous FVIII in plasma samples, activated partial thromboplastin time was shortened and thrombin generation was promoted in a dose-dependent manner. A single subcutaneous injection of NXT007 was well tolerated without occurrence of thrombotic events. The long half-life, pharmacological effect, and safety profile supported study progression to the subsequent multiple-ascending-dose parts of the NXTAGE study in PwHA."

    "abstract": "Information on inhibitor development in nonsevere hemophilia and its association with clotting factor concentrate type is limited. To assess inhibitor development in patients with nonsevere hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) in the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance system. Inhibitors and total treated patients are reported annually. Any exposure to concentrate per year was considered a treatment year. Incidence rates per 1000 treatment years and 95% CIs were calculated according to type of concentrate and compared using incidence rate ratios (IRRs). During 2008 to 2023, 90 centers reported on 36,074 (HA) and 9238 (HB) treatment years. The inhibitor rate for nonsevere HA receiving factor (F)VIII was 4.2 per 1000 treatment years (95% CI, 3.5-4.9). Inhibitors developed at median 47.5 years (P25-P75 [IQR], 17.0-69.0), after median 40 exposure days (EDs; IQR, 17-80), with 58% occurring <50 EDs and 88% <100 EDs. Overall, 4 of 149 (2.7%) patients in the inhibitor group were female. Only one inhibitor was reported in nonsevere HB, in a female patient (FIX 7%, after 6 EDs), resulting in an inhibitor rate of 0.1 per 1000 treatment years (95% CI, 0.0-0.6). Compared with standard half-life recombinant FVIII, inhibitor rates on both plasma-derived FVIII (IRR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.58; <i>P</i> < .001) and extended half-life FVIII (IRR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.02-0.68; <i>P</i> = .002) were significantly reduced. Inhibitors in nonsevere hemophilia occurred at a rate of 4.2 per 1000 treatment years in HA and 0.1 per 1000 treatment years in HB. Compared with standard half-life FVIII, inhibitor development on plasma-derived and extended half-life FVIII were reduced. These data show that inhibitor monitoring is relevant with nonsevere HA in both sexes and should be continued lifelong."

    "title": "Pharmacokinetic evaluation of concizumab for the treatment of hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Replacement therapy is the global standard of care in hemophilia. However, several unmet needs have favored the development of non-factor therapies. Concizumab, an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI) administered daily, restores thrombin generation in all hemophilia subtypes. The pharmacokinetic profile of concizumab from several clinical trials demonstrates target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and a consistent exposure-response profile when given daily. Concizumab has an acceptable safe profile and efficacy in hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors. Despite the availability of diverse therapies for hemophilia management, unmet needs remain, including limited prophylaxis for hemophilia B inhibitor patients. Concizumab was developed to address this gap. Its target-mediated drug deposition results in a nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile and a need for a daily injection schedule, which ensures a stable, consistent, and sustained pharmacokinetic profile. While the daily injection may seem demanding, it does not compromise the optimal benefits of concizumab prophylaxis. Moreover, the acceptable safe profile and efficacy of concizumab in bleed prevention in hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors provide reassurance that it may be a therapeutic option in managing all hemophilia patients."

    "abstract": "Real-world data are needed to evaluate treatment implementation, outcomes and costs of care in haemophilia patients switching prophylaxis from standard half-life (SHL) to extended half-life (EHL) clotting factor concentrates (CFCs). We characterised treatment regimens, annual bleeding rate (ABR), adherence and costs in a nationwide Finnish haemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) cohort on prophylaxis, including non-switchers and switchers from SHL to EHL CFC. This retrospective register study of adult patients with HA and HB was performed in University Hospitals during 2016-2021. Clinical and healthcare data were captured from electronic health records and national healthcare registers. Majority, 74% of HA and 71% of HB patients, switched from SHL to EHL. Thereafter, weekly mean infusions of CFC decreased (FVIII SHL 2.8, EHL 2.2; FIX SHL 1.6, EHL 0.9; p < 0.001). The mean annual consumption (international units, IU) increased by 18% from 219,534 per HA patient during SHL to 258,317 during EHL (p < 0.05) and declined per HB patient by 28% from 221,685 to 160,209 (p < 0.01). ABR appeared to decline after the switch in HA (mean SHL 2.8, EHL 0.9) and HB (SHL 1.6, EHL 0.8), while treatment adherence improved in HA from 81% to 95% (p < 0.01). The mean annual total costs of care in HA were €176,979 for SHL and €195,760 for EHL. In HB, the costs increased from €180,930 to €236,208 (p < 0.01). Majority of patients on prophylaxis switched to EHL. The switch alleviated the infusion regimen, tended to lower bleeding rates and improved adherence with somewhat increased costs."

    "abstract": "Performing major surgical procedures on hemophilia patients is a challenge for dental surgeons. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder linked to the X chromosome and can be classified as type A, characterized by changes in coagulation factor VIII, and type B, in factor IX. The objective of this study is to report the authors' experience in the treatment of hemophilia patients undergoing surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion. Two adult patients diagnosed with maxillary atresia and severe Hemophilia A were treated with factor VIII replacement preoperatively, aiming for plasma levels of 100% and maintenance of replacement during the Hyrax device activation period at levels of approximately 40% to 50%. In the trans-operative period, fibrin sealant was applied to the osteotomy line and surgical wound. The cases were treated by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology service and by the Hematology and Hemotherapy service of a tertiary hospital. No complications were associated with the treatment period. Surgical treatment of maxillary atresia, conducted by a maxillofacial surgeon, and systemic clinical management performed by a hematologist in patients with severe Hemophilia A, proved to be effective and safe for the two cases reported."

    "abstract": "Joint and muscle bleeding in persons with haemophilia (PwH) causes acute pain, an important patient-reported outcome for evaluating treatment response. Eptacog beta is a recombinant activated human FVII bypassing agent approved for the treatment and control of bleeding in PwH A or B with inhibitors (PwHABI) ≥12 years using initial dose regimens (IDRs) of 75 or 225 µg/kg. To evaluate pain reduction in PwHABI who treated bleeding episodes (BEs) with eptacog beta during the PERSEPT 1 trial. PwHABI were randomly assigned to 75 or 225 µg/kg IDRs for BE treatment. Participants reported pain levels at predefined treatment evaluation timepoints using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain analyses were stratified by age, IDR assignment, and baseline pain levels. The diagnostic potential for using VAS pain score reductions to assess treatment response was explored using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Five adolescents and 22 adults treated 468 BEs. Mean VAS scores decreased 30%-58% from baseline at 3 h post-initial eptacog beta infusion amongst age and IDR categories, with further VAS score reductions observed through 24 h. PwHABI with high baseline BE pain showed larger absolute VAS score reductions before ending treatment than PwHABI experiencing mild BE pain. The optimum VAS score percentage reduction cutoff for predicting treatment outcomes was 44%. Pain relief over 24 h was observed with eptacog beta treatment across IDR and age categories. This post hoc study demonstrates that percentage reduction from baseline VAS score influences perception of bleed resolution and can predict treatment outcomes."

    "abstract": "Emicizumab is approved for routine prophylaxis, but limited data exist investigating the relationship between bleeds and exercise in people with haemophilia A (PwHA) receiving emicizumab. To evaluate the relationship between physical activity and bleeding outcomes in Japanese PwHA receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. This prospective, multicentre, observational study was conducted in Japanese PwHA initiating emicizumab between November 2019 and October 2021. Physical activity and bleeding events were reported using an electronic patient-reported outcomes application, while activity intensity was collected by a wearable activity tracker worn over five 8-day monitoring periods. Data on safety were recorded by investigators using electronic case report forms. Quality of life data were also collected and will be reported in a separate publication. Overall, 129 participants enrolled. Median age was 32 years (range 0-73), and 83.7% of participants had severe HA. Overall, 73 participants performed 968 exercise events, with 18.8% and 6.0% of events classified as moderate and high risk, respectively. Two (0.2%) exercise events were associated with bleeding: one basketball (moderate risk) and one fishing (low risk). In total, 137 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 62 participants. No serious AEs were emicizumab-related. The mean annualised treated bleed rate was 1.9 and 51 (39.5%) participants experienced zero bleeds during the study period (97 weeks). This study suggests that PwHA receiving emicizumab prophylaxis can participate in a wide range of physical activities with minimal bleeding risk, which supports their access to the health benefits of exercise. Emicizumab remains well tolerated."

    "title": "Assessing stigma in a predominantly male hemophilia population: a Chinese cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by impaired blood clotting, with prevalence of 2.73 per 100,000 individuals in China. Advancements in medical technology have significantly improved patient survival, however, individuals with hemophilia continue to experience chronic pain, recurrent joint hemorrhages, and functional impairments, particularly in the limbs. These physical challenges often lead to psychological issues such as anxiety and depression, contributing to heightened stigma. This study aimed to assess the current level of stigma among patients with hemophilia and to identify associated influencing factors. Convenience sampling was applied to recruit patients from a hemophilia treatment center. As hemophilia predominantly affects males, the sample consisted of 231 males and one female (consistent with epidemiological sex ratios in China). The Social Impact Scale (SIS; 24 items, score range: 24-96, higher scores = greater stigma) and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS; 10 items, score range: 12-66, higher scores = greater support) were used to assess stigma and social support, respectively. Multiple linear regression was employed to analyze factors associated with stigma. The mean total stigma score among hemophilia patients was 63.88 ± 15.27. Multiple linear regression revealed that higher social support (<i>β</i> = -0.69, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.47], <i>P</i> < 0.001) and being married (<i>β</i> = -6.17, 95% CI [-10.06, -2.28], <i>P</i> = 0.002) were associated with lower stigma, whereas more frequent bleeding episodes (<i>β</i> = 7.79, 95% CI [2.04, 13.54], <i>P</i> = 0.008) and lower limb disability (<i>β</i> = -6.11, 95% CI [-9.86, -2.36], <i>P</i> = 0.002) were associated with higher stigma. Lower monthly income was also linked to increased stigma (<i>β</i> = -1.85, 95% CI [-3.58, -0.12], <i>P</i> = 0.036). These variables explained 28.9% of the total variation of the total stigma score. Stigma among patients with hemophilia is at a moderate to severe level. Targeted interventions should be prioritized for unmarried patients, those facing financial hardship, individuals with lower limb disabilities, and those experiencing frequent bleeding episodes. Enhancing psychological health education and social support is essential in mitigating stigma among hemophilia patients."

Two independent datasets from the multi-country patient record form (PRF)-based study and PicnicHealth/Komodo Health study were analyzed to understand the real-world use of EHL products for patients with hemophilia A (HA). Most patients receiving EHL prophylaxis were on per-label dosing. Those receiving individualized dosing had moderate to severe disease. EHL dose adjustment occurred in 20% of patients of which 14.3% experienced a second dose adjustment. Treatment efficacy was mainly monitored via annualized bleeding rate (ABR) with quality of life, tolerability, and treatment efficacy being the primary considerations for Healthcare Personnel when selecting treatment. Switching to a different EHL or standard half-life (SHL) product did not significantly reduce median ABR while switching to non-factor therapy significantly reduced median ABR from 5.2 to 0.94, <i>p</i> < 0.0001. Patients on individualized dosing had higher ABRs than those on per-label dosing both before index EHL treatment and while on EHL treatment, whereas individualization via dose adjustment was associated with significant median ABR reduction (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Individualization may support improved outcomes in patients unable to achieve satisfactory outcomes on a per-label dosing regimen."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are life-threatening congenital bleeding disorders traditionally managed with frequent factor replacement therapies, often complicated by breakthrough bleeds and inhibitor development. Marstacimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting TFPI, has emerged as a novel prophylactic treatment to reduce bleeding episodes in patients without inhibitors. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed across multiple databases. Meta-analysis was conducted using R, applying a random-effects model. Nine manuscripts were included. Marstacimab significantly reduced the annualized bleeding rate (mean difference: -16.30; 95% CI: [-18.46, -14.15], <i>p</i> < 0.001) and showed a favorable safety profile with most adverse events being mild or moderate, and no thrombotic events reported. The use of a prefilled pen device further highlighted the therapeutic benefits and ease-of-use of Marstacimab. This meta-analysis reinforces the efficacy and safety of Marstacimab in reducing bleeding rates in severe hemophilia A and B. The findings support its role as a promising, transformative alternative to conventional factor replacement therapies. The study protocol for this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/), and it was allocated the PROSPERO identification number CRD42024620215."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder. Its occurrence secondary to hepatobiliary malignancies is even rarer, and without timely diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rate is extremely high. There is a need to raise awareness of this disease. This report describes a case of a 70-year-old female patient diagnosed with AHA 2 months after surgery for cholangiocarcinoma, admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College in October 2022. The patient presented with subcutaneous hematoma in both lower limbs. Coagulation function tests showed a markedly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 74.5 seconds, with no correction in the APTT mixing test. Coagulation factor assays revealed a severely reduced coagulation factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) of 0.3%, and an inhibitor titer of 25.6 BU/mL was detected. After ruling out other potential causes, the patient was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma-associated AHA. With chemotherapy to control the primary tumor, alongside hemostatic and immunosuppressive therapy for inhibitor eradication, AHA was brought under control. The patient had no further coagulation abnormalities or bleeding, enabling timely and full-course chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma and significantly improving survival and quality of life. Therefore, in patients with malignancies who present with spontaneous bleeding or unusual bleeding following surgery, trauma, or invasive procedures, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of secondary AHA. Timely diagnosis and treatment can significantly improve prognosis."

    "abstract": "Clot waveform analysis (CWA) is a technique that continuously monitors changes in light transmittance or absorbance during fibrin clot formation in plasma, enhancing routine clotting test assessment. Patients with Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) and Hemophilia A (HA) both exhibit isolated prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); however, their management differs significantly. CWA can aid in distinguishing between these conditions, particularly in cases where standard coagulation tests are inconclusive and specialized assays are unavailable. This prospective case-control study included patients with demonstrable LA (n = 69), healthy controls (n = 75) and diseased controls [HA with (n = 16) and without inhibitor (n = 36). The quantitative data of aPTT-CWA including velocity peak time, acceleration peak time and height of acceleration [-] were significantly lower in LA-positive samples with prolonged aPTT in comparison with HA without inhibitors. The qualitative data comprising Shoulder in 1st derivative, Biphasic wave in 2nd derivative [-] and Serrated wave pattern in 2nd derivative were significantly common in HA samples without inhibitors. In comparison to healthy controls, LA-positive patients with normal aPTT had significantly lower velocity peak time and height of velocity along with higher width of velocity. In acceleration peak time and width of acceleration [-] peak were significantly higher along with lower height of acceleration [+] and height of acceleration [-]. AUROCs of height of acceleration [-], width of acceleration [-] and width of velocity were statistically and biologically significant. The shoulder in 2nd derivative was significantly common in LA-positive samples. The aPTT-CWA has limited utility for differentiating LA positive from HA samples with and without inhibitors. However, aPTT-CWA may help in selecting patients with normal aPTT who merit further confirmatory testing for LA with a compatible history."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder characterized by deficiency or dysfunction of the factor VIII clotting protein, leading to serious bleeding disorders. Conventional treatment involves the exogenous administration of factor VIII. However, this therapy faces significant challenges, including the development of inhibitors and the need for frequent intravenous administration. Emicizumab, a recombinant bispecific monoclonal antibody that can be administered subcutaneously, offers a novel therapeutic alternative by mimicking the action of factor VIII. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction with emicizumab in patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE, SciELO, and LILACS databases. The included studies were original articles on the use of emicizumab in hemophilia A patients without inhibitors and reviews, short communications, expert comments, and case reports were excluded. Data extraction and analysis were performed using predefined criteria. A total of 471 articles were identified, with 28 meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies demonstrated robust evidence of the efficacy of emicizumab in reducing bleeding episodes, with significant reductions in the Annualized Bleeding Rate and Annualized Joint Bleeding Rate. Safety profiles were favorable, with mainly minor adverse events reported. High patient satisfaction scores highlighted improvements in quality of life and treatment adherence. Emicizumab represents a significant advancement in hemophilia A treatment, offering superior efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction compared to traditional therapies. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes and specific subpopulations to further validate these findings."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is a hereditary X-linked hemorrhagic disorder. Following the first treatment with exogenous factor (F)VIII, one-third of patients with severe HA develop anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors), which render treatment ineffective. Recent findings underlined the critical role of DNA methylation in several autoimmune diseases by altering gene expression profiles. This study was designed to evaluate potential differences in DNA methylation profiles of previously untreated patients (PUPs) who develop inhibitors against FVIII and those who do not, with the aim of identifying immune-regulatory genes that may contribute to the risk of inhibitor formation. In this study, we aimed to understand whether CpG sites are differentially methylated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PUPs and have a role in inhibitor development to better understand the biological pathways that lead to inhibitor development. A case-control study was performed using 45 inhibitor-positive and 67 inhibitor-negative PUPs from the Survey of Inhibitors in Plasma-Product Exposed Toddlers study cohort. Enrichment bisulfite sequencing was performed on DNA samples from PBMCs of HA patients and differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) were identified with bioinformatic approach. Overall, information on 621,121 CpG sites was obtained. Two thousand seven hundred seventy-two sites were significantly differentially methylated (unadjusted <i>P</i> value < .05).

Cytokine and altered N-glycan profiles have the potential to be biomarkers in association with the presence of inhibitors in persons with HA. We investigated the association of cytokine and plasma N-glycan profiles with inhibitor presence. In 60 persons with HA and 23 controls, we analyzed 10 cytokines and used multivariable regression to assess their association with inhibitor presence. Given the challenges of validating these findings in previously untreated patients, we employed an HA mouse model to explore the association between cytokine levels and inhibitors. We also examined the correlation between plasma N-glycan profiles and inhibitors in persons with HA, analyzing adult and pediatric groups separately due to age-dependent glycosylation. Elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL) 6 levels, coupled with decreased IL-10, were significantly associated with inhibitor presence in multivariable regression analysis. High-titer inhibitor was observed in factor (F)VIII-treated mice experiencing chronic inflammation with increased levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, a murine IL-8 homolog, but not in those receiving FVIII alone, consistent with our clinical observations. Inhibitor-positive adult patients exhibited higher biantennary <i>N</i>-glycan and reduced multiantennary <i>N</i>-glycan ratios compared with inhibitor-negative adults. Conversely, inhibitor-positive pediatric patients displayed decreased sialic acid ratios. These findings highlight the association of inhibitor presence with altered plasma cytokine levels and <i>N-</i>glycosylation patterns. Prospective validation is crucial to confirm these associations, develop robust biomarkers, and improve inhibitor risk assessment for persons with HA."

However, the development of antidrug antibodies (ADA) against emicizumab, although rare, can impair its efficacy. In cases with low drug levels or bleeding events, differentiating between ADA- and adherence-related issues can be challenging. We aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a modified bridging ELISA (Valsecchi et al, JTH 2021) in detecting ADA in patients suspected of developing this response. Clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively collected from six patients with suspected ADA and one with a confirmed case. The modified ELISA was performed blindly to identify potential ADA presence. After a new ADA case was confirmed, it was characterized by assessing its expression over time and neutralizing effect. Five patients had emicizumab levels ≤1µg/mL, while two had higher levels (13 and 15µg/mL). Among the patients, two experienced spontaneous bleeding, and four had traumatic bleeding. ADA was detected in two patients, including the one with a known ADA. In ADA-negative patients, emicizumab levels increased following adjustments for compliance or administration issues. The newly identified ADA was neutralizing, blocking emicizumab's binding to factors IX and X. Its pattern of expression was similar to that of the known ADA case, peaking three months after the loss of emicizumab efficacy and remaining positive for over a year after emicizumab discontinuation. In bleeding patients with low emicizumab levels, the modified bridging ELISA may effectively differentiate ADA patients from those with adherence."

Current state-of-the-art treatment consists of frequent administration of prophylactic infusions of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) protein or bispecific antibodies that replace the cofactor function of FVIIIa to maintain hemostasis. However, these treatments are far from ideal, due to their high cost, the need for lifelong treatment, the fact that they are unavailable to a large percentage of the world's persons with hemophilia A (PWHA), and the high risk of treatment failure due to immune response to the infused FVIII protein. Thus, there is a need for novel treatments, such as those using gene therapy and/or cell transplantation, that can promise long-term correction or permanent cure. In the present review, we discuss the clinical feasibility and unique advantages a prenatal approach to HA treatment could offer, placing special emphasis on a sheep model of HA we developed and on using mesenchymal cells (MSC) as cellular delivery vehicles for the FVIII gene to achieve a single treatment cure for HA prior to birth."

The TFH/TFR ratio significantly increased in FVIII inhibitor-producing mice. The emergence of TFR cells correlated with titers of FVIII inhibitors in FVIII-immunized mice. Using TFR-deficient Foxp3Cre+Bcl6fl/fl (Bcl6FC) mice, we found that the loss of TFR cells led to significantly decreased FVIII inhibitors compared to wild-type (WT) mice upon FVIII immunization (24±16 and 131±114 BU/ml, respectively) but not total anti-FVIII IgG levels and that TFR cells regulated IgG subclass switching and FVIII-specific B cell responses. Interestingly, upon FVIII immunization, mice with phosphatase Pten deficiency in Foxp3+ cells (Foxp3Cre+Ptenfl/fl), a model with augmented TFR cells, developed markedly lower FVIII inhibitor titers (8.1±8.6 BU/ml) than WT controls. When CD4Cre+Bcl6fl/fl mice, a TFH and TFR deficient model, were immunized with FVIII, none of the animals developed FVIII inhibitors. In conclusion, FVIII immunization induces TFR cell activation and expansion. TFR cells have a dual function in regulating the development of FVIII inhibitors, and the TFH/TFR pathway is pivotal in FVIII inhibitor development in mice."

    "title": "Development and Validation of a Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry Method for Blood Desmopressin Quantification and Its Application in Hemophilia A Patients.",
    "abstract": "Desmopressin (DDAVP), which indirectly increases Coagulation Factor VIII concentrations in the blood, is a common treatment for bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia A. However, DDAVP exhibits significant variability in response due to interindividual differences in pharmacokinetics. Consequently, exploring its pharmacokinetics is of primary importance to better understand the relationship between DDAVP administration and therapeutic outcomes. To that end, the measurement of DDAVP concentration is essential. This article describes the development and validation of a liquid chromatography method coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry detection for quantifying DDAVP in human plasma. After sample pretreatment involving protein precipitation followed by solid-phase extraction, quantification was based on the four most intense isotopes, utilizing targeted single ion monitoring, with a method range of 20-2000 pg.mL<sup>-1</sup>. For the four QC levels, accuracy and precision for both inter- and intra-assay measurements were below 11.6% and 13.8%, respectively, meeting FDA recommendations. After validation, this method was applied to a cohort of 10 patients with a deficiency in Coagulation Factor VIII, who received 0.3 μg.kg<sup>-1</sup> of desmopressin acetate. The mean volume of distribution at steady state was 18.8 L (CV% 26.7), the mean clearance was 7.8 L.h<sup>-1</sup> (CV% 25.1), and the mean half-life was 1.8 h (CV% 14.7). Offering valuable insights into the pharmacokinetics of DDAVP, this method will be useful for further studies and holds promise for optimizing treatment regimens in this patient population."

    "title": "Model-informed drug development of Mim8 - a next-generation bispecific antibody for treatment of haemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Haemophilia A is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Mim8 (denecimig) is a next-generation activated FVIII mimetic bispecific antibody under phase 3 investigation for subcutaneous management of haemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors. Mim8 uses tiered dosing, which is a novel dosing approach in haemophilia where patients receive a fixed dose according to which body weight range they fall into and their chosen dosing frequency, reducing the need for dose calculations and potentially reducing treatment wastage. This study aimed to establish the early population pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of Mim8 using both biomarker and clinical endpoint data. Models were used to inform drug-development decisions using trial simulations and transform the dosing strategy in haemophilia to a novel simplified treatment option using tiered dosing in paediatric and adult populations. Data from 129 participants exposed to Mim8 in the phase 1 PK trial (NCT0512747) and the FRONTIER1 trial (NCT04204408) were used to develop population PK and PK/PD models for thrombin generation and treated bleeds. The models were used for trial simulations to optimise dosing regimens evaluating Mim8 exposure, biomarker and clinical endpoint targets on a population level (paediatric and adolescent/adult) and on a typical subject level for the range of body weight (BW) in the trial. Clinical endpoint targets were set to: (1) at least 70 % of patients without treated bleeds in a 6-month trial on a population level and >95 % reduction in relative bleed risk on a typical subject level across all weight ranges and dosing frequencies, and (2) sustained peak Mim8 exposure below highest exposure observed in phase 1/2 trials. The population PK of Mim8 were best described with a structural two-compartment model with baseline BW as the most significant covariate for Mim8 exposure. Both peak thrombin response and Mim8 effect on bleed risk were best described with a direct link PK/PD model with an E<sub>max</sub> response. Model-estimated EC<sub>50</sub> was 2.03 µg/mL for peak thrombin and 0.07 µg/mL for bleed risk. Using trial simulations, tiered dosing in three weight ranges (<15, 15-<45, and ≥45 kg) was identified to reach the clinical endpoint targets and maximum desired exposure for all three dosing frequencies: once every week, once every 2 weeks, and once every month. This was done with an initial one-time loading dose establishing steady-state conditions within the first day, followed by maintenance doses at the desired dosing frequency. Loading and maintenance doses for the nine combinations of weight ranges and dosing frequencies were covered by five dose presentations. Ongoing phase 3 trials have been based on the dosing strategy presented here. Model-informed drug development was used to design a novel treatment paradigm for patients living with haemophilia A by utilising a tiered-dosing strategy with Mim8, to be evaluated in phase 3 trials."

    "title": "Gene-based therapies for hemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy is a transformative approach to treating genetic disorders in order to improve disease outcomes for patients. Hemophilia A and B are inherited genetic disorders caused by mutations in the <i>FVIII</i> and <i>FIX</i> genes, respectively. Traditional treatments for hemophilia have included intravenous plasma, factor concentrates, and nonfactor therapies that require lifelong prophylaxis and carry risks of factor inhibitor development. Gene therapy offers a novel solution by delivering functional <i>FVIII</i> or <i>FIX</i> genes via adeno-associated virus vectors, which enable the production of the missing factors. Clinical outcomes have shown promise through gene therapies like valoctocogene roxaparvovec for hemophilia A and etranacogene dezaparvovec and fidanacogene elaparvovec for hemophilia B. Each therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing bleeding rates and maintaining factor activity. However, challenges such as hepatotoxicity, immune response, and durability of gene expression persist. Future advancements aim to expand eligibility, achieve sustained expression, and minimize adverse effects. Current trials are exploring new vectors, transgenes, and methods to overcome existing limitations. Gene therapy holds the potential to revolutionize hemophilia treatment, offering a path toward long-term management and improved quality of life for patients."

    "abstract": "The patient was a 47-year-old man. He was diagnosed with hemophilia A in childhood, and received replacement therapy with FVIII products. However, this became ineffective due to inhibitor production, and he was treated with emicizumab. He developed fever and vomiting, and abdominal CT revealed an enlarged gallbladder and gallstones. Acute cholecystitis was diagnosed, and he was hospitalized and treated conservatively with antibiotics. On the 12th day of illness, the anemia progressed and a high-density area was observed in the gallbladder by CT scan, leading to a diagnosis of hemorrhagic cholecystitis. Since the inhibitor titer was low at 3.6 BU/ml, neutralization therapy with FVIII products was attempted. FVIII activity increased to 155%, and emergency laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy was performed successfully. After surgery, FVIII replacement therapy was continued and FVIII activity was maintained, but on the 19th day of illness, it decreased to 16%, and inhibitor levels rose again. Emicizumab is effective in preventing bleeding in hemophilia A with inhibitors, but the risk of bleeding is high if tissue damage leads to severe inflammation or necrosis. Neutralization therapy with FVIII products might be effective in hemorrhagic emergencies and minimally invasive surgery for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors when emicizumab is used to reduce inhibitor levels."

This real-world study was conducted to understand patient characteristics, clinical and economic burden, and treatment patterns amongst patients with haemophilia A in China with the aim of improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Two data sources, namely the National Haemophilia Registry and Institute of Haematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, were used to analyse the disease burden, treatment patterns and economic burden of haemophilia A in China. The economic burden was assessed from 2017 to 2019. Overall, 3164 male patients with haemophilia A (mean age 21.5 years) were analysed. Almost half (48.3%) of the patients were children or adolescents; amongst them, 13.5% were enrolled from Guangdong and 10.7% from Hebei. Furthermore, 58.9% of the patients had severe haemophilia A. The most common sites for the first bleeding and bleeding during disease course were skin/mucous membrane (40.0%) and joints (77.9%), respectively. Plasma-derived factor VIII constituted the most frequently used therapy (45.8% of patients) and only 30.1% of patients used a prophylactic treatment. The hospitalisation rate increased from 8% in 2017 to 21% in 2019, whereas 63% to 75% of patients had outpatient visits during each year. The total annual cost of treating haemophilia (hospitalisation plus outpatient) including the cost of FVIII replacement per patient was 57,439.4 CNY. Suboptimal disease management and low utilisation of prophylaxis are the main challenges for patients with haemophilia A in China. Therefore, continued efforts to improve disease awareness and treatment accessibility are required."

We sought to investigate the prevalence of hemophilia in women and girl relatives of persons with hemophilia in Burkina Faso. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted from September 2021 to September 2023. Female relatives of male persons with hemophilia (PwH) currently followed-up at hospitals were included after providing a written consent and completing the ISTH bleeding assessment questionnaire. Blood samples were collected for hemostasis (Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, Factor VIII or IX level) and other (Complete Blood Count, C-reactive protein; ABO/Rh blood typing) tests. Overall, 94 WG relatives of PwH participated. Their mean age being 34.2 ± 11.4 years. Seven out of 92 tested (7.6%) exhibited FVIII or FIX levels between 6% and 39% and then had been identified as WGH. Common bleeding symptoms were bleeding from the oral cavity and menorrhagia. We highlighted the high value of FVIII/IX testing for female relatives to PwH."

Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is an approved AAV-based gene therapy for severe hemophilia A. We present a molecular characterization of the vector integration profiles in 5 human biopsy samples from valoctocogene roxaparvovec clinical trials as well as in samples from valoctocogene roxaparvovec-treated nonhuman primates (NHPs). The number of genomic integrations was substantially below the previously reported number of transgene-expressing cells, and integration profiles were similar between human and NHP samples. The integration profiles were polyclonal, similarly distributed across the genome, and demonstrated a small bias toward regions of open chromatin and actively transcribed genes, with no relative enrichment in cancer-associated genes. These observations were replicated between species and support the concept that preclinical assessment of AAV vector integration in NHPs is representative of outcomes in humans."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A is a rare disorder leading to excessive bleeding, resulting from a deficiency in circulating clotting factor VIII. While we know that raising factor VIII levels for extended periods of time would reduce the frequency of injections required and provide more consistent bleed protection, the relationship between factor activity levels (FALs), clinical outcomes, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for people with haemophilia A (PwHA) has not been well characterised. This study explored the relationship of FALs with annual bleeding rate (ABR) and HRQoL in PwHA. This retrospective, cross-sectional study used data from the CHESS II study (2018-2020) including men aged ≥ 18 years with haemophilia A in Europe. Physicians provided patient characteristics and clinical outcomes from the medical records. Patients completed a questionnaire with HRQoL (EQ-5D) and socio-economic information. PwHA receiving on-demand treatment who had baseline factor VIII levels < 40 IU/dL and no inhibitors were included. Regression models explored FALs with ABR and HRQoL controlling for age, BMI, and presence of blood-borne viruses. A total of 403 PwHA were included (167 provided HRQoL responses). Mean age was 37 years. Mean baseline FAL was 7.0 IU/dL and mean ABR was 2.3 (SD, 2.64). A negative binomial model showed for every 1% increase in FVIII levels, ABR decreased by 3.9% (0.09 events; P < 0.001). A tobit model showed that every 1% increase in FVIII levels was associated with an increase of 0.0054 points in mean EQ-5D index score (P < 0.001). This study offers tangible estimates of how higher FALs may relate to lower ABR and elevated HRQoL for PwHA."

    "abstract": "Subungual haematomas are a collection of blood underneath the nail subsequent to trauma. Whilst a commonly recognised injury in the general population, there is limited literature and no guidelines for management in haemophilia patients. This case series aims to provide insight into the clinical characteristics, management and sequelae of subungual haematomas in the haemophilia group. A retrospective case series was performed of patients with haemophilia presenting with subungual haematomas between July 2018 and June 2024, and the background literature reviewed. Data were collected from electronic medical records and analysis was purely descriptive given the small cohort included. Six individual cases were identified with traumatic subungual haematomas. Five patients were male (83.3%), there was an event split between haemophilia A and B cases, with severity ranging from mild to moderate. One patient with mild haemophilia A also had concurrent type 1 von Willebrand disease. Most cases (83.3%) had a 48-72 h delay before hospital presentation. Five cases (83.3%) required either nail trephination or removal. Two moderate haemophilia B patients (33.3%), had recurrent bleeding within the first 2 weeks post injury. Haemophilia patients presenting with subungual haematomas should be considered for nail trephination or surgical intervention as per standard of care following factor replacement. Larger patient series may provide more insight into comparative outcomes in haemophilia patients versus the general population. Early collaboration between haematology and surgical teams is important. Inclusion of this site-specific bleed into patient education resources and haemophilia guidelines warrants consideration."

    "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic (PK)-guided dosing of factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates is widely recommended to personalise the treatment of haemophilia A patients. However, it is well known that commonly applied target FVIII plasma levels do not necessarily improve bleeding outcomes in all individuals. It is therefore desirable to adapt treatment based on individual bleeding risk rather than only factor levels. Unfortunately, there is currently no reliable clinical marker that reliably discerns between patients with low or high bleeding risk. We explore the possibility of using repeated time-to-event (RTTE) models to quantify individual bleeding risk by combining (historical) information on annual bleeding rates and PK, without requiring the measurement of novel clinical markers. We improve upon existing RTTE models using data from 264 severe haemophilia A patients followed during three clinical trials. The model classifies patients into low, medium, or high bleeding frequency cohorts to reduce between-patient variability and predicts bleeding risk for specific categories of bleeds rather than pooled bleeding information. The resulting model has high accuracy, with >70% of predictions being within one bleed of the true observed bleeding rate. We demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to compare treatment not only based on the achievement of specific factor levels and factor concentrate consumption, but also on projected bleeding outcomes. Importantly, this approach does not require the measurement of novel or unconventional biomarkers, facilitating its adoption in routine clinical practice. The proposed method may present an exciting new treatment paradigm for haemophilia A patients."

Herein, we studied the effects of lack of family history in HA and the subsequent delay of diagnosis on bleeding pattern and early treatment, as well as on the risk of inhibitor development. For this purpose, data on 1237 severe HA patients with known family history (\"positive\" or \"negative\"), born between 2000 and 2022, were collected in 29 participating centres. At diagnosis, 45.9% (554/1208) of patients had a positive family history of HA and 54.1% (654/1208) had a negative family history. A positive family history significantly shortened the time to diagnosis (8 months) and the treatment initiation (2 months). Prophylaxis was more frequently the first treatment in those with a positive family history compared to the negative family history group (21% vs. 13%). Bleeding was the main reason for first exposure day (ED) in both groups, but less frequently in the family history group than in those without a family history (67% vs. 80%). Positive family history was associated with fewer peak treatments at first five EDs (12% vs. 16%). In non-inhibitor patients, bleeding occurred earlier in those with positive family history (9.2 months vs. 10.6 months). The inhibitor incidence was similar in both groups (33% vs. 30%), and a positive family history was associated with earlier inhibitor development (13 months vs. 15 months). The majority of patients presented without a family history of HA which led to a delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation."

This study aimed to identify patients with haemophilia A (PwHA) and observe trends in joint-related outcomes and life-threatening haemorrhages using national claims data. This serial cross-sectional study analysed claims data from the Health Insurance and Review Assessment in South Korea. PwHA treated with FVIII at least twice between 2007 and 2022 were identified. We observed joint procedures, life-threatening haemorrhages and comorbidities between 2008 and 2021. The number of identified PwHAs was 1193 in 2008 and 1517 in 2021. The proportion of older adult patients has increased over the past 14 years. The joint procedure rates per 1000 patients were 61.2 (95% CI 48.0‒76.9) in 2008 and 17.1 (11.2‒25.1) in 2021. The rate was highest in patients with a severe phenotype. Annually, less than 2% of patients experienced life-threatening haemorrhages, with approximately 90% of the cases attributed to central nervous system and gastrointestinal bleeding. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes increased over the years (6% in 2008 and 15% in 2021, and 6% in 2008 and 9% in 2021, respectively). This study revealed previously unreported long-term trends in haemophilia-related outcomes and comorbidities in Korean PwHA. Although the number of older adult patients has increased, joint-related complications have decreased over time. The trends, observed over 14 years, provide valuable insights for enhancing the treatment of PwHA."

While the main treatment for hematomas in the airway entails replacing the coagulation factor products, in cases with a high risk of asphyxia, deciding whether or not to perform a tracheotomy can be difficult. We report the case of a patient with severe hemophilia A with rapidly worsening dyspnea due to hematomas caused by an acute upper respiratory tract infection and covering the airway at the upper part of the epiglottis and the tongue base. Laryngoscopy revealed a hematoma of the tongue base, but the hypopharynx and larynx were not visible owing to the hematoma. A CT scan also showed narrowing of the airway due to the hematoma. Given the high risk of obstruction, a tracheotomy was performed under general anesthesia. Efraloctocog alfa, a recombinant coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) product with an extended half-life, was administered to maintain trough levels of coagulation FVIII at 80% or above for eight days after tracheotomy. A repeat CT scan performed four days after the tracheotomy confirmed that the hematoma had improved. The patient was discharged 18 days after the tracheotomy with the tracheostoma closed. If patients with hemophilia complain of throat discomfort or dysphagia, the airway should be assessed via laryngoscopy. Emergency tracheotomy and treatment with a recombinant coagulation factor product by a medical team comprising emergency physicians, hematologists, and otolaryngologists is required for hemophilia patients with a high risk of airway obstruction."

However, the conventional approach to discovering splice-modulating ASOs is both laborious and expensive. Here, we describe a novel approach that integrates data-driven RNA structure prediction and community science to discover splice-modulating ASOs. Using a splicing-deficient pathogenic variant of F8 exon 16 as a model, we show that 25% of the top-scoring molecules designed in the Eterna OpenASO challenge have a statistically significant impact on enhancing exon 16 splicing. Additionally, we show that a distinct combination of ASOs designed by Eterna players can additively enhance the inclusion of the splicing-deficient exon 16 variant. Together, our data suggests that crowdsourcing designs from a community of citizen scientists may accelerate and complement traditional avenues for the discovery of splice-modulating ASOs with potential to treat human disease."

Our aim was to evaluate the joint condition in PwnSHA in a real-world setting. A nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted. To mitigate the impact of discrepancies between factor VIII (FVIII) assays, baseline FVIII levels were determined using chromogenic and one-step clotting assays. Mutation in F8 gene, baseline FVIII levels, thrombin generation and age were assessed. The joint condition was described using the HEAD-US score by trained specialists at each participating hospital. One hundred and twenty-four patients were recruited, 84 of them with an available HEAD-US evaluation, who were finally included in our analysis. The median age was 38.4 years (18.3-48.5). Twenty percent (16/84) had moderate hemophilia (MoH) with FVIII levels of 4.0 IU/dL (2.6-4.6), and 80% (68/84) had mild hemophilia (MiH) with FVIII levels of 14.8 IU/dL (10.4-19.9), (p< 0.001). JD (HEAD-US>0) was observed in 50% (8/16) of MoH patients (HEAD-US= 6.5 [5.5-8.5]) and in 40% (27/68) of those with MiH (HEAD-US= 3.0 [2.0-6.5]), p=0.198. In the moderate group, JD was primarily observed in ankles (44%), while in the MiH group, knees were the most affected (31%). MoH patients reported a hypocoagulable thrombin generation profile compared to MiH patients (p<0.05). Near half of PwnSHA had JD. A worse joint health and a lower thrombin generation was observed in MoH population. These patients can benefit from an early prophylaxis and prevent further joint deterioration.

Biological samples and clinical data from severe and moderately severe persons with HA (PwHA; FVIII < 0.02 IU/mL) were obtained before any or after minimal exposure (≤5 days) to FVIII (T0), at inhibitor development (INB+), at 75 exposure days (ED) without inhibitor (INB-) (T1) and at end of ITI (T2). Biomarkers were assessed at T0, T1 and T2. One hundred patients were analysed, of whom 32 (86.5%) developed high-responding inhibitor and underwent ITI. We found no difference in the plasma concentration of the 15 immunological biomarkers at T0 or at T1 versus T2 in INB+ compared with INB-. However, at T1, PwHA INB+ who failed ITI had higher median concentration of interleukin (IL)-2 (3.50 vs. 0.85 pg/mL; q = 0.016), IL-10 (3.46 vs. 0.74 pg/mL; q = 0.035), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (11.18 vs. 0.93 pg/mL; q = 0.016), interferon-gamma (INF-γ) (98.57 vs. 3.57 pg/mL; q = 0.035) and CCL5 (5245.11 vs. 3107.86 pg/mL; p = 0.037) compared with those who achieved complete response, respectively. Patients who failed ITI had higher concentration of IL-2, IL-10, TNF, INF-γ and CCL5 in comparison with complete responders, suggesting that these biomarkers could be potential predictors of ITI outcome."

    "title": "RNAi targeting heparin cofactor II promotes hemostasis in a canine model of acquired hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a critical anticoagulant protein that inactivates thrombin. In our previous mouse studies, we demonstrated that GalNAc-HCII, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HCII conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), exhibited promising therapeutic effects in hemophilia A mouse models. Further evaluation in large animal models, especially with FVIII inhibitors, is essential before GalNAc-HCII can proceed to clinical trials. In this study, we successfully established, for the first time, an acquired hemophilia A canine model by multiple intravenous injections of a rabbit-dog chimeric neutralizing anti-canine FVIII antibody. In the control group, the Beagle dogs exhibited spontaneous bleeding symptoms accompanied by prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). After administration, GalNAc-HCII (0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg) demonstrated potent, dose-dependent, and durable HCII inhibitory effects. After 5 days, in normal dogs, GalNAc-HCII reduced HCII levels to 32.67% ± 3.07% and 10.62% ± 1.74% with 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg GalNAc-HCII, respectively. In hemophilic dogs, GalNAc-HCII treatment significantly improved hemostatic function. Specifically, in the carotid artery thrombosis model, the thrombus formation time was shortened [29.7 ± 2.08 min (0.8 mg/kg) and 18.0 ± 1.0 min (1.6 mg/kg) vs. 40 min (control), P < 0.01]; in the knee joint puncture-induced bleeding model, joint bleeding and synovitis were alleviated; and in the saphenous vein bleeding model, the number of hemostatic events increased. Furthermore, repeated administration of GalNAc-HCII effectively reduced the prolonged APTT. This study demonstrates the efficacy of GalNAc-HCII in hemophilic dogs, suggesting it as a promising novel therapeutic option for patients with hemophilia, including those with FVIII inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are rare X-linked bleeding disorders caused by coagulation factor deficiencies, leading to joint bleeding, synovial hypertrophy and chronic hemophilic arthropathy marked by progressive cartilage and bone damage. Musculoskeletal issues remain the primary source of morbidity in people with hemophilia (PwH). Despite significant advances in prophylactic therapies, joint pain, functional limitations, and deterioration persist. The long-term impact of novel treatments on joint health and physical activity levels remains incompletely understood. Early detection and prevention of damage is challenging, highlighting the need for highly sensitive diagnostic tools to identify subclinical changes before irreversible damage occurs. Pain management, currently adapted from other conditions, does not fully meet the unique needs of PwH. Research into targeted pain relief, synovial hypertrophy management, and cartilage regeneration is crucial. Addressing unmet needs in diagnosis, treatment, and management requires collaboration between clinical and research communities to improve care effectiveness and enhance the quality of life for PwH."

    "abstract": "In vivo gene therapy to the liver using lentiviral vectors (LV) may represent a one-and-done therapeutic approach for monogenic diseases. Increasing LV gene therapy potency is crucial for reducing the effective doses, thus alleviating dose-dependent toxicities and facilitating manufacturing. LV-mediated liver transduction may be enhanced by positively selecting LV-transduced hepatocytes after treatment (a posteriori) or by augmenting the initial fraction of LV-targeted hepatocytes (a priori). We show here that the a posteriori enhancement increased transgene output without expansion of hepatocytes bearing LV genomic integrations near cancer genes, in mouse models of hemophilia, an inherited coagulation disorder. Furthermore, we enhanced hepatocyte transduction a priori in mice by transiently inhibiting antiviral pathways and/or through a fasting regimen. The most promising transduction-enhancer combination synergized with phagocytosis-shielded LV, resulting in a remarkable 40-fold increase in transgene output. Overall, our work highlights the potential of minimally invasive, cost-effective treatments capable of improving the potency of in vivo LV gene therapy to hepatocytes, in order to expand its applicability and ease clinical translation."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder that primarily affects males and results in the deficiency of clotting factors VIII (haemophilia A) or IX (haemophilia B). One of the most debilitating long-term complications of haemophilia is chronic joint damage with pain, and reduced mobility, due to bleeding into the joints. As the primary cause of morbidity in people with haemophilia (PwH), joint health assessment is critical for disease management and optimizing patient outcomes. Among the tools developed to monitor joint health in PwH, the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) has emerged as the most widely used and validated clinical tool. There is evidence supporting the use of the HJHS in both children and adults. In contrast to scoring methods that incorporate imaging techniques, which primarily describe the morphology of the joints, the HJHS allows for the assessment and monitoring of joint functionality."

Previous studies, along with our clinical observations, have identified distinct incidence rates and clinical manifestations of factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) inhibitors in patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) and severe hemophilia B (HB). In order to explore different immune responses to FVIII and FIX in HA and HB patients and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the varying clinical manifestations of these patients, we performed single-cell sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from five HA and five HB patients with inhibitors. After quality control, a total of 75,051 cells were clustered into 19 subsets. Transcriptome analysis revealed differences in the composition of lymphocyte subsets and the functional status of immune cells between the HA and HB groups. Additionally, immune repertoire analysis indicated variations in the diversity of B and T cell clones between the two groups. HA group exhibited a relatively higher proportion of B cells and more active B cells, whereas HB group demonstrated a higher proportion of T cells, with more active CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. Our study provides insights into the distinct biological processes underlying the distinct immune responses to therapeutic FVIII and FIX in HA and HB patients, as revealed through single-cell sequencing of PBMCs from hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The data generated will serve as a valuable resource for future research on how the immune system recognizes and initiates responses to antigens with varying molecular characteristics."

This study investigates the in vitro hemostatic activity of Mim8 in blood samples from six patients with severe hemophilia A using a thrombin generation assay (TGA) and thromboelastography. The results were compared to those obtained with emicizumab. TG was assessed in both platelet-poor (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Fibrin clots formed during TG were collected, and clot ultrastructure was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Whole blood samples were analyzed using ROTEM-NATEM. Mim8 significantly improved the TG capacity of severe HA plasma samples. Mim8 6 μg/mL demonstrated higher TG capacity compared to emicizumab 50 μg/mL. In PRP samples fortified with Mim8 6 μg/mL and rFVIIa 90 μg/kg together, ETP levels were fully normalized. No synergistic effect was observed when FVIII concentrate was combined with Mim8 at therapeutic doses due to the higher affinity of FVIII for FIXa and FX compared to Mim8. ROTEM-NATEM in whole blood confirmed the TGA results. SEM showed a more robust fibrin clot structure with thinner fibrin fibers in the presence of Mim8 compared to emicizumab. Mim8 significantly improves TG in vitro in both PPP and PRP from patients with severe HA, with ETP levels comparable to those of FVIII at 100 IU/dL. The TGA can effectively monitor the combined treatment with Mim8 and either rFVIIa or APCC, which is not possible with currently available routine laboratory tests."

    "abstract": "To investigate if FVIII-Fc Fusion protein (FcFVIII) may modulate inflammation and immune stimulation in hemophilic synovium via the Fc-portion of immunoglobulin used for half-life extension we performed gene expression profiling in FVIII-deficient mice. Hemarthrosis was induced by sub-patellar puncture in FVIII-KO mice, + /- periprocedural recombinant human (rh)FVIII,murine (m)FcFVIII, or mIgG2a. Synovium was harvested at baseline and on days (D) 3 and 14, followed by RNA extraction and sequencing, and histological analysis. RNASeq data were processed using standard protocols followed by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. Functional enrichment analysis generated molecular pathways (KEGG and Reactome). To distinguish between on-target and off-target (related and unrelated to injury/bleed) effects the following groups were compared: i) Baseline vs. injured-saline, ii) injured-saline vs. injured-rhFVIII, iii) injured-saline vs. injured-mFcFVIII. Knee injury in FVIII-KO mice resulted in hemarthrosis, which was prevented by peri-procedural rhFVIII and mFcFVIII treatments. Only a small proportion of genes was affected by FVIII treatment, exhibiting overlap but also distinct differences between both FVIII-preparations. Acutely (D3), mFcFVIII had unique on-target effects related to immune and inflammatory regulation, whereas rhFVIII mostly affected mRNA and protein processing. On day 14, macrophage profiling indicated a transition from M1 to M2, and only mFcFVIII uniquely influenced pathways and genes associated with tissue remodeling and repair. Some mFcFVIII DGE patterns resembled mIgG2a patterns. Synovial vascular remodeling and cartilage health were better with mFcFVIII than rhFVIII. Interestingly, both FVIII-preparations exerted off-target effects on immune system pathways, albeit with temporal differences. These observations provide proof-of-principle that the type of FVIII preparation can influence synovial processes beyond acute hemostasis control, deserving exploration in the setting of joint bleed control in hemophilia."

However, little is known about how current information provision is perceived and what the needs are. Gain in-depth insights into experiences and needs regarding information provision of caregivers of young children with haemophilia, and the perspectives of their healthcare providers (HCPs). A qualitative study was conducted including 15 semi-structured interviews with caregivers and seven interviews with HCPs. Purposive sampling ensured a varied sample regarding the child's age, type and severity of haemophilia, and treatment strategy. A comprehensive thematic content analysis was subsequently conducted using several phases of coding. Three main themes were identified. First, caregivers and HCPs indicated that current disease knowledge and information provision regarding haemophilia varies and could be improved. Both groups underlined the importance of adequate information provision to support decision-making and alleviate anxiety. Second, the need for standardized, centralized and tailored information was expressed, preferably digital. Current information is experienced as fragmented and incomplete, leading to lack of structure and uncertainties. Lastly, information provision cannot exist without additional coaching by the multidisciplinary treatment team and peers. Both caregivers and HCPs experience unmet needs regarding information provision as currently performed. Empowerment can be provided by standardized, centralized information tailored to disease severity and phase of life. A digital information platform with visual support, could provide a complete, up-to-date, readily available and reliable resource."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intron 22 inversion in hemophilia A patients in Assam, Northeast India, and evaluate its correlation with disease severity. This hospital-based observational study included 80 hemophilia A patients at Assam Medical College from March 2023 to February 2024. Clinical history, coagulation tests (activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), and factor VIII assay), and nested long-distance polymerase chain reaction (NLD-PCR) for intron 22 inversion detection were performed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Among the 80 patients, 41 (51.25%) had severe hemophilia A, 22 (27.5%) moderate, and 17 (21.25%) mild. Intron 22 inversion was detected in 24 patients (30%), with a significantly higher prevalence in severe cases 22/41 (53.65%) compared to moderate 2/22 (9.09%) and mild cases (0%) (p < 0.001). APTT was significantly prolonged in severe cases (109.35 ± 15.62 sec) compared to moderate (86.92 ± 9.87 sec) and mild cases (61.71 ± 8.94 sec) (p < 0.001), reinforcing the genetic basis of disease severity. This study confirms a strong correlation between intron 22 inversion and severe hemophilia A, consistent with global and Indian studies. It emphasizes the need for routine genetic screening for early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies, including genetic counseling. Future research should explore other F8 mutations, gene therapy, and the role of intron 22 inversion in inhibitor development."

    "abstract": "Some patients with nonsevere hemophilia A (HA) are diagnosed with reduced factor (F)VIII activity (FVIII:C) relative to FVIII antigen (FVIII:Ag) and are classified as cross-reactive material-positive. We previously found a novel FVIII-Lys1693Asn (K1693N) natural mutation in a patient with HA with moderate phenotype (FVIII:C/FVIII:Ag = 1.9 IU/dL/124 IU/dL). To examine the mechanism(s) involving the P<sub>4</sub>' site on thrombin cleavage site at Arg<sup>1689</sup> in a cross-reactive material-positive phenotype. FVIII-K1693N and its comparison variant K1693A were analyzed for t thrombin-mediated activation. FVIII-K376N, listed in the HA database due to a similar Lys-to-Asn substitution, was examined with K376A as its comparison. All mutants were expressed in BHK cells. FVIII-K1693N showed delayed cleavage at Arg<sup>1689</sup> and low peak FVIII:C, while FVIII-K1693A showed mildly reduced FVIII:C after thrombin activation. Mildly reduced peak FVIII:C and similar cleavage to wild-type was illustrated, however, with the FVIII-K1693A mutation after thrombin activation. These findings indicated that the conversion to Asn at P4' site mediated thrombin resistance. FVIII specific activities of FVIII-K376N and FVIII-K376A were 6.1%/3.1% (one-stage assay) of wild-type, respectively. Thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at Arg<sup>372</sup> was comparable to wild-type with both mutants, but thrombin-catalyzed FVIII activation was severely-depressed. Spontaneous decay rates of FVIIIa activity with FVIII-K376N (k = 0.53) and FVIII-K376A (k = 0.99) were greater compared to wild-type (k = 0.32), suggesting that cleavage of P4' site following cleavage at Arg<sup>372</sup>contributed to A1-A2 domainal interaction. Lys1693 and Lys376, both located at P<sub>4</sub>' sites, are suggested to influence FVIII function via distinct mechanisms, indicating that patient-derived mutations can reveal functional aspects of FVIII activation."

To survey hemophilia providers to map global approaches/perspectives/challenges in diagnosing WGwHA with a chromogenic assay (CSA) vs one-stage assay (OSA) and other diagnostic tools to diagnose WGwHA compared with MBwHA. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Scientific and Standardization Committees on FVIII, FIX and Rare Coagulation Disorders and Pediatric and Neonatal Thrombosis and Haemostasis convened a working group, which compiled a Research Electronic Data Capture survey and disseminated it to global hemophilia providers. Descriptive statistics were applied to survey results. Of 174 respondents, 95% were hemophilia providers, comprising 34% adult hematologists, 58% pediatric hematologists, 2% nurse practitioners, and 0.5% nurses; 95% were providers for WGwHA and WGwHMB. The results showed that CSA with/without OSA is ordered by fewer providers in women and girls (WG, 35%) than in men and boys (MB, 61%; P < .001). OSA is ordered by more providers (62%) in WGwHA due to various assay-related reasons. Bleeding Assessment Tool and genetic testing were not used to diagnose WGwHA by 29% and 33%, respectively. Based on our survey results, CSA is ordered less frequently in diagnosing WGwHA compared with MBwHA, likely due to assay-related factors including cost, availability, and insurance coverage, and possibly due to some providers not considering assay discrepancies in WGwHA. Increasing global availability and improving provider consideration of assay discrepancies in WGwHA can increase use of both assays. Improved use of assays and other diagnostic tools, such as Bleeding Assessment Tool scores, will improve effective diagnoses of WGwHA."

These conditions lead to spontaneous bleeding, joint damage, inhibitor development, and the burden of frequent intravenous infusions. Concizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), is a novel non-factor therapy that enhances thrombin generation. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of concizumab prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A and B.MethodsThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the use of concizumab in hemophilia A or B were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases. Outcomes of interest included annualized bleeding rate (ABR), thrombin generation, bleeding episodes, immunogenicity, and adverse events. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 was used for quality assessment.ResultsFive studies were included. Concizumab prophylaxis was associated with a notable reduction in ABR, with reported decreases from 9.4 to 1.3 episodes/year and from 19.6 to 2.9 episodes/year in hemophilia A, and from 14.9 to 1.6 episodes/year in hemophilia B. Thrombin generation increased in a dose-dependent manner and stabilized by week 24. Across all studies, bleeding episodes were significantly reduced. Adverse events were primarily mild to moderate. No thromboembolic events were reported.ConclusionConcizumab appears to be an effective and safe prophylactic treatment for patients with hemophilia A and B, demonstrating consistent reductions in bleeding rates and enhanced thrombin generation. Further long-term studies are warranted to establish its sustained safety and efficacy."

Currently, there is a dearth of understanding on the unusual morphology of proximal femur in PWH. To explore how does the Dorr classification of proximal femur affect the total hip arthroplasty (THA) of PWH, we conducted a retrospective study on PWH with different Dorr classifications who underwent THA. The retrospective study comprises data of adult patients who received THA from 2018 to 2022 in the research center. Patients with a diagnosis of hemophilic arthritis and received THA were included and divided into three groups according to Dorr classification. The X-ray images were acquired before the surgery to determine the Dorr classification. The surgical time, surgical blood loss, laboratory examinations post-operation including hemoglobin (HB), total protein (TP), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer (D2), C-reactive protein level (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and functional evaluations 1 year after surgery including visual analogue scale (VAS), Harris hip score (HHS), range of motion (ROM) were collected. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used to test data normality, and t-test is performed by SPSS 20. P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. 33 PWH are included in the study and have finished follow-up. All cases are male patients. Among the 33 hips, 19 (57.6%) are classified to Dorr A, and 12 (36.4%) are Dorr B, and only 2 (6%) are Dorr C. No significant difference is found in expanse, hospital stay, surgical time and total blood loss. PWH with Dorr A requires significant less coagulation factor than Dorr B and Dorr C. All Dorr types of hips present good recovery from the surgery according to the perioperative examinations including hemoglobin (HB), total protein (TP), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer (D2), C-reactive protein level (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and thigh circumference (TC). The 2-year follow-up demonstrates favorable functional rehabilitation according to functional evaluations including visual analogue scale (VAS), Harris hip score (HHS), and range of motion (ROM). In this study, we find that PWH tend to have higher prevalence of Dorr A than the general population. PWH with Dorr A requires smaller dosage to maintain the coagulation factor activity than the Dorr B and Dorr C. Additionally, all types of hip present favorable recovery after THA. Ultimately, the study supports that THA is an effective treatment for PWH with all Dorr classifications by alleviating the pain and improve the motor function."

We compared costs in each period, between pre- and post-ITI, and evaluated the determinants of costs during ITI. A total of 32 %, 38 % and 30 % of PwHA achieved complete (CS), partial success (PS), and failed ITI, respectively. The mean cost per PwHA during ITI was US$1.18 million; US$355,838 in CS, US$724,986 in PS, and US$2,653,217 in the failure group. During ITI, approximately 65 % of the variability of the mean cost/kg was explained by the outcome of ITI (failure or PS), duration of ITI, use of prophylactic bypassing agents, and use of incremental FVIII regimen. In post-ITI, we observed about 50 % and 22 % reduction of mean cost/kg in CS and PS, respectively, while failing ITI resulted in increased costs of over 100 % compared with pre-ITI. Regardless of the outcome, in post-ITI, the annualized bleeding rate reduced when compared with pre-ITI. Costs with CFC during ITI were the lowest with CS, followed by PS and failure. In comparison with pre-ITI, successful ITI was associated with reduced costs, already noticed in the first year post-ITI."

    "abstract": "Hemophilic arthritis is a progressive joint disease often requiring surgical intervention in advanced stages. However, comparative evidence on perioperative inflammatory and coagulation responses between single joint replacement (SJR) and multiple joint replacement (MJR) remains scarce. This study aimed to assess the differences in perioperative outcomes, including inflammatory responses, blood transfusion requirements, and functional recovery, to guide surgical decision-making for hemophilic arthritis patients. This retrospective study included 29 male patients with moderate-to-severe hemophilic arthritis who underwent SJR (n = 12) or MJR (n = 17) at a single institution from October 2020 to October 2023. Data on inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR, IL-6, WBC), hemoglobin levels, blood transfusion requirements, and joint mobility were collected for the immediate postoperative period (days 1-14). Trends in inflammatory markers were analyzed using average percent changes (APC), and differences in outcomes were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Longitudinal changes were analyzed using mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA with time points as fixed effects and subjects as random effects. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Postoperative CRP levels declined significantly in both groups, with APCs of -9.06% (95% CI: -15.63 to -1.98, p < 0.05) for the SJR group and -8.42% (95% CI: -16.18 to 0.06) for the MJR group. ESR showed a significant upward trend, with APCs of 10.82% (95% CI: 0.95-21.65, p < 0.05) in the SJR group and 17.54% (95% CI: 11.71-23.67, p < 0.05) in the MJR group. Blood transfusion requirements were comparable, with median transfusion volumes of 0.00 units (IQR: 3.50) for SJR and 0.00 units (IQR: 3.75) for MJR (p = 0.761). Notably, joint mobility scores were significantly better in the MJR group (mean: 31.88, SD: 19.31) compared to the SJR group (mean: 18.33, SD: 10.39; p = 0.030). Despite the larger surgical scope of MJR, no significant differences in infection or bleeding risks (SJR:median transfusion = 0.00 units, IQR: 3.50; MJR:median transfusion, 0.00 units, IQR: 3.75. p = 0.761) were observed between the groups. This study demonstrates that MJR offers superior functional recovery compared to SJR, without increasing the risks of infection, bleeding, or transfusion. These findings support MJR as a safe and effective surgical option for hemophilic arthritis patients when appropriate perioperative management protocols are implemented. Future studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed to validate these results and explore extended outcomes."

    "title": "Thrombotic Complications in Hemophilia: An Intricate Conundrum.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are rare genetic disorders characterized by low plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII or factor IX, resulting in a bleeding tendency with a clinical severity proportional to the degree of the clotting factor deficiency. Although rare, hemophilia patients can paradoxically experience thrombotic events that complicate the clinical picture and the management by physicians operating at hemophilia treatment centers. Such thromboembolic complications, which can involve either the arterial or the venous districts, recognize various causes, including aging (due to the progress of care during the last three decades) and inherited and acquired (treatment-related) risk factors. These determinants often interact with each other to increase patients' susceptibility to thrombosis. In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms, clinical presentation, and management of thrombotic complications in hemophilia patients."

    "abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and severe hemophilia A are 2 rare and potentially life-threatening congenital diseases. The coincidence of these diseases has not been reported so far. We present the first case of a newborn with both diseases. SCID can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, how to successfully manage a newborn with severe hemophilia A during intensive HSCT treatment is the key clinical question of this case report. Prophylactic factor (F)VIII substitution during HSCT was performed with an extended half-life FVIII product (efmoroctocog alfa). The platelet count was a major factor influencing the dosage of FVIII. No bleeding complications or FVIII inhibitors occurred during this individualized management. This is the first case report of a newborn suffering from both SCID and severe hemophilia A. HSCT is feasible in this situation without bleeding complications if an individual substitution regimen with FVIII is applied."

    "abstract": "A 63-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis was admitted to the emergency room, because of left leg pain associated with spontaneous subcutaneous hematomas, for 15 days. Their symptoms also occurred after the discontinuation of aspirin, which the patient had taken for a previous case of ocular papillitis. Laboratory tests showed anemia, a normal platelet count, but a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio; a computerized tomography scan of the left lower limb detected a recent hematoma in the left lateral rectus muscle, and subcutaneous soft tissue edema also involving the knee, without vascular involvement. Coagulation tests were performed showing normal levels of Lupus Anticoagulant, very low-factor FVIII activity (2.2%), normal FIX, FXI, and FXII activity, and the detection of FVIII inhibitors by a Bethesda assay (7.6 U). A diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A (AHA) was made, and hemostatic and immunosuppressive treatment was immediately started (activated prothrombin complex concentrates and methylprednisolone). Malignancies and infections were excluded. An autoantibodies panel confirmed the positivity to rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. In treatment, the patient did not present any new bruises, with aPTT normalizing, FVIII increasing, and inhibitors reducing until disappearance. A close follow-up continued every 1-2 week after discharge, with hemostatic treatment discontinuation and methylprednisolone decalage. Underlying autoimmune conditions induced this rare, autoimmune and life-threating disorder."

    "abstract": "The increasing age of patients with congenital hemophilia poses new challenges for clinicians. Not only the consequences of bleeding but also age-related diseases, especially cardiovascular disorders, are of great concern. Factors such as hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia further increase the cardiovascular risk in elderly patients with hemophilia. Preventive treatment of these cardiovascular diseases may therefore also be necessary in hemophilia patients. However, determining the optimal level of anticoagulation in patients with reduced levels of coagulation factors is often difficult and requires an individualized approach. Given the absence of substantial evidence from large clinical trials, clinicians rely on case reports and expert opinions to guide the therapy. This case report details the individual risk-benefit assessment and management of a 57-year-old hemophilia A patient with atrial fibrillation."

    "abstract": "Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are rare, chronic conditions characterized by blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder in which autoantibodies target coagulation factor VIII, often associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of AIBD and AHA is rare, with limited understanding of their combined impacts. We aimed to synthesize the available evidence and provide insights into clinical manifestations, treatment strategies, and survival outcomes of such patients. We searched for relevant literature in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus, and combined patient information from our hospital to provide a comprehensive analysis. A total of 80 patients were included. Through log-rank tests, older age (p = 0.03) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) (p = 0.047) were associated with shorter survival time. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, mortality was only associated with older age (HR: 1.13, p = 0.02). Patients presenting both AIBD and AHA exhibit intricate clinical presentations and are at risk of severe, potentially fatal outcomes. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding bleeding in AIBD patients, particularly those with BP and those in the geriatric population."

To characterize the anti-FVIII antibody profile in AHA patients by assessing isotypes, subclasses, and correlations with key clinical parameters. Eighty AHA patients were retrospectively analysed by assessing FVIII inhibitor levels, antibody isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgM), IgG subclasses, and domain specificity using a bead-based assay. Clinical data were correlated with antibody profiles. IgG domain profiles were compared with a congenital haemophilia A (CHA) cohort. The cohort had a median age of 74 years, with 60% males. Idiopathic cases accounted for 67%, and 17% had bleeding linked to medical interventions. Major bleeding sites were musculoskeletal/retroperitoneal (45%) and skin (36%). Within six months, 18% of patients died, mostly from sepsis. Anti-FVIII IgG antibodies were present in all patients, with IgG<sub>4</sub> (96%) and IgG<sub>3</sub> (60%) being the most common subclasses. IgM and IgA anti-FVIII antibodies were detected in 17.5% and 18.8% of patients, respectively, with IgM positivity associated with higher mortality (33%). IgG<sub>4</sub> subclass correlated significantly with inhibitor titres (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.54; p < 0.001). Compared to CHA, AHA showed a higher prevalence of C1C2 domain-targeting antibodies (49% vs. 77%), associated with NBA levels (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.51; p < 0.001). Anti-FVIII antibody profiling reveals distinct patterns in AHA, with IgG<sub>4</sub> linked to higher inhibitor levels. The C1C2 domain specificity of the anti-FVIII antibodies suggests a potential role of this FVIII domain in the immunopathology of AHA patients, warranting further investigation to improve prognostic tools."

Patients ≥12 years old with severe HA, severe/moderate HB or HAwI/HBwI of any severity were treated according to the local standard of care (SoC). The number of bleeding episodes from enrolment up to a maximum of 115 weeks, physical activity based on data collected by a wrist-worn physical activity tracker, target joints and Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) measurements were assessed. A total of 231 patients across 33 countries were enrolled. The mean annualised bleeding rate (ABR) (standard deviation) for treated bleeding episodes was investigated for patients receiving prophylaxis (HA: 4.7 [5.9]; HB: 2.2 [3.0]; HAwI: 10.3 [8.5]; HBwI: 12.4 [14.1]) and those receiving on-demand (OnD) treatment (HA: 21.5 [17.7]; HB: 10.5 [8.6]; HAwI: 15.2 [14.8]; HBwI: 9.3 [13.3]). Physical activity levels were lowest among patients with HBwI. Target joints were similar among haemophilia types and treatments. Overall, mean and median HJHS total scores were lower for patients receiving prophylaxis compared with OnD treatment. The explorer6 study assessed a large haemophilia patient population in a real-world setting across 33 countries. The results indicate that an unmet need remains among patients receiving OnD treatment and those with inhibitors. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03741881."

It is important for patients with hemophilia to maintain good oral health and prevent oral diseases because of their increased propensity to bleed. Few large-scale studies exist on the oral health status of patients with hemophilia. In our search across three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed), only 14 articles about the oral health status of hemophilic patients were extracted. Oral health status was classified into caries status, periodontal status, and oral hygiene status and compared with that of a healthy group. In total, 13 of the 14 papers investigated the dental caries status of hemophilia patients, and the most common report was \"no difference\" compared to healthy subjects (7 papers, 53.8%), followed by \"poor\" (4 papers, 30.8%). Periodontal status was investigated in 6 papers, of which 4 (66.7%) reported that the status of hemophilia patients was \"poor\" compared to that of healthy controls. Oral hygiene status was investigated in 12 studies, with 7 studies (58.3%) reporting it to be \"poor\" in hemophilia patients compared to healthy controls, followed by 3 studies (25.0%) reporting \"no difference\". Oral hygiene status is associated with other items, such as caries and periodontal disease, and it is paramount in maintaining good oral health in hemophilic patients. In addition, regular dental visits improve oral hygiene, resulting in the prevention of oral disease. It is important to increase awareness of this information among patients with hemophilia and for medical and dental professionals to cooperate to improve patients' oral health status, with the aim of improving their quality of life."

    "abstract": "Missense mutations are the most prevalent alterations in genetic disorders such as hemophilia A (HA), which results from coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) deficiencies. These mutations disrupt protein biosynthesis, folding, secretion, and function. Current treatments for HA are extremely expensive and inconvenient for patients. Small molecule drugs offer a promising alternative or adjunctive strategy due to their lower cost and ease of administration, enhancing accessibility and patient compliance. By screening drug/chemical libraries with cells stably expressing FVIII-Gaussia luciferase fusion proteins, we identified compounds that enhance FVIII secretion and activity. Among these, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) improved the secretion and activity of wild-type FVIII and common HA-associated missense mutants, especially mild and moderate ones. SAHA increased FVIII interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP/GRP78 but not with calreticulin. Lowering cellular BiP levels decreased SAHA-induced FVIII secretion and enhancing BiP expression increased FVIII secretion. SAHA also enhanced secretion and BiP interactions with individual domains of FVIII. In vivo, treating mice with SAHA or a BiP activator boosted endogenous FVIII activity. These findings suggest that SAHA serves as a proteostasis regulator, providing a novel therapeutic approach to improve the secretion and functionality of FVIII missense mutants prone to misfolding."

Owing to the lack of experimental systems that allow for the study of human anti-FVIII immune responses, the mechanisms underlying replacement therapy-induced anti-FVIII antibodies in HA patients remain largely unknown. Therefore, experimental systems that enable the study of human anti-FVIII immune responses are needed.We generated severe immunodeficient NOD-scid IL-2Rnull; FVIIInull mice (NOG HA) that can serve as hosts for human cord blood (hCB) transplantation and established a HA mouse with a humanized immune system to induce the anti-FVIII responses in human immune cells <i>in vivo</i>.The proportions of immune cell subsets (CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD33+ macrophages, and CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells) in the bone marrow, spleen, and peripheral blood were similar between NOG HA and NOG mice 4 months after hCB transplantation. The hCB-engrafted NOG HA mice retained HA severity. To activate the anti-FVIII immune response in hCB-engrafted NOG HA mice, we administered recombinant (r)FVIII plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) once a week for 3 months. We detected both anti-FVIII IgM and IgG in the plasma of hCB-engrafted NOG HA mice after treatment with 12 doses of rFVIII and LPS. Taken together, our humanized mice with HA maintained a severe phenotype and generated human anti-FVIII IgG antibodies <i>in vivo</i>, thus representing a valuable model for studying human anti-FVIII immune responses."

    "abstract": "Combined deficiency of factors V and VIII is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with an increased risk of bleeding. We present an unusual case of a 7-year-old Moroccan child with no history of consanguinity who was hospitalized owing to a hemorrhagic episode during circumcision. The 7-year-old patient, a Moroccan boy from North Africa, coming from a family of five siblings, was referred for an evaluation of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. Coagulation factor assays revealed a combined deficiency of factors V and VIII, with normal levels of other coagulation factors. This anomaly was detected in the hematology laboratory, where hemostasis tests were performed via optical methods on the Acl Top 750 analyzer. A complete blood count was conducted on the Beckman Coulter DXH 900 analyzer. Hemostasis assessments revealed an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time at 73.2 s (normal range < 36), with a patient-to-control activated partial thromboplastin time ratio of 2.58 (normal ratio < 1.2), a low prothrombin time at 18.35 s (normal prothrombin time range: 11.4-13.5), and an international normalized ratio of 1.59 (normal range: 2-3.5). Specific coagulation factor assays demonstrated a combined deficiency of factors V and VIII at 12.4% (normal range: 55-150) and 9.1% (normal range: 50-145), respectively, whereas other coagulation factor levels remained within the normal range, including the antigenic activity of von Willebrand at 71.7% (normal range: 50-150). The complete blood count showed no abnormalities, except for a small thrombocytosis. The child was managed in the pediatric hematology department, and a family investigation among the remaining siblings was initiated to search for similar cases. Our study highlights a rare and often underdiagnosed genetic disorder that is often confused with a diagnosis of minor hemophilia A or congenital factor V deficiency. Differential diagnosis is crucial, particularly for von Willebrand disease. Combined deficiency of factors V and VIII should be suspected in patients with a suggestive clinical and laboratory profile, including prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time along with a deficiency in coagulation factor V. Therefore, measuring factor VIII levels is highly recommended."

Nineteen samples were collected from ten patients taking warfarin, and the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was used to define near-normal (INR 1.2-1.48; n = 4), subtherapeutic (INR 1.56-1.9; n = 7) and therapeutic (INR > 2.0; n = 8) groups. Factor (F)VIII activity (FVIII:C) was neutralized using an anti-FVIII inhibitor antibody (termed FVIII-depleted) before the addition of emicizumab (50 µg/mL). Coagulation potential was measured using Ca2 + -triggered rotational thromboelastometry, and was compared with that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. The average PT-INR in the near-normal, subtherapeutic, and therapeutic groups was 1.3 ± 0.1, 1.7 ± 0.1, and 2.4 ± 0.3, respectively. The hemostatic potential in FVIII-depleted samples mixed with emicizumab in the near-normal group was comparable to that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. The coagulation potential in FVIII-depleted samples after addition of emicizumab in the subtherapeutic and therapeutic groups were lower than that in emicizumab-treated PwHA. PT-INR monitoring could be informative in emicizumab-treated PwHA due to the influence of vitamin K-dependent proteins."

DDAVP elicits the release of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) from endothelial cells, thereby increasing the levels of circulating VWF and coagulation factor (F)VIII. However, we currently lack detailed insight on additional systemic effects of DDAVP administration on plasma protein levels. This study aimed to investigate plasma proteomic profiles associated with DDAVP administration. Longitudinal plasma samples of 13 patients with VWD and 9 people with mild HA up to 24 hours after DDAVP infusion were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Among 408 proteins quantified in plasma, only VWF and VWF propeptide (pp) increased significantly at 1 and 2 hours after DDAVP infusion in people with HA and VWD, respectively. VWF antigen levels were in agreement with mass spectrometry-based VWF intensity levels (<i>ρ</i> = 0.89). A slower clearance was observed for VWF compared with that for VWFpp, accompanied with higher interindividual variation. In 4 people with HA, C-reactive protein levels increased 24 hours after DDAVP infusion, which correlated with serum amyloid A1/A2 levels. This study showed the selective increase of VWF and VWFpp 1 to 2 hours after DDAVP infusion and highlighted the interindividual variance in VWF clearance. Additionally, a delayed acute-phase response in a subgroup of patients suggested the potential role of inflammatory mechanisms contributing to heterogeneity of response."

Combining rituximab with immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the secondline regimen, but data and predictors are limited. To evaluate the efficacy of ITI-rituximab and to identify the predictors of prognosis. In total, 76 children with high-titer inhibitor prospectively using low-dose ITI together with 1-3 round(s) of rituximab were evaluated for outcomes: success or failure and rapidity (rapid or slow) of inhibitor negativity (ie, inhibitor titers turned negative, inhibitor negativity [IN]). The whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to analyze the gene expression profile of 4 failure patients (excluding F8 large deletion) and 4 rapid success-IN patients. Success IN was achieved in 41 of 76 (53.9%) patients after first-round of rituximab, 50 of 76 (65.8%) after second-round of rituximab, and 51 of 76 (67.1%) after third-round of rituximab. Profile of inhibitor decay followed an exponential decay curve. Time to a given inhibitor titer during ITI-rituximab could be estimated by the model t=ln(Y0-PlateauY-Plateau)k. The newly observed poor prognostic factors included relapse after the first-round of rituximab and early occurence of poor-outcome events.. RNA-seq analysis showed 186 upregulated differential expressed genes (DEGs) and 176 downregulated DEGs in failure subjects compared with those in patients with rapid success IN. The upregulated DEGs included CXCL8, NLRP6, CHI3L1, CLEC9A, THBD, and PROS1. The downregulated DEGs included STAT1, TLR7, C1Q, C2, IDO1, and CD38. Success IN was achieved in 67% of children with hemophilia A with high-titer inhibitor treated by ITI-rituximab. A model based on the profile of inhibitor-titer decay can be used for predicting outcomes.

To demonstrate proof-of-principle, the current study specifically focuses on quantifying clotting Factor VIII (FVIII), a critical parameter in Hemophilia A management. Therefore, a chemiluminescent-based FVIII assay (FVIII<sub>lum</sub>) was designed to quantify the activity levels in citrated plasma samples. All reagents necessary for the assay are contained in the disposable part of the device. To detect FIXa/FVIIIa tenase activity, a caged chemiluminescent substrate specific for activated Factor X (FXa) was synthesized for ultrasensitive real-time measurement of FVIII-mediated FXa generation. Experiments with the FVIII<sub>lum</sub>, performed with the microfluidic cartridge with dried-in reagents, showed high level of precision. In addition, the FVIII<sub>lum</sub> was capable to distinguish FVIII deficient plasma from plasma with only 0.017 IU/mL activity, demonstrating its applicability for Hemophilia A management. Finally, proof-of-principle was obtained by pharmacokinetic monitoring of FVIII activity in patient samples, demonstrating good agreement with the reference method. This study successfully presents a new miniaturized chemiluminescent platform, incorporating microfluidics and photon sensors, designed to detect multiple parameters in parallel per cartridge."

    "title": "Inherited Hemophilia-A Multidimensional Chronic Disease That Requires a Multidisciplinary Approach.",
    "abstract": "Articular damage is a marker of hereditary hemophilia, especially affecting the large joints of the upper and lower limbs. This retrospective study aimed to emphasize that hereditary coagulopathies, specifically hemophilia A and B, require a multidisciplinary approach due to their complex nature. The primary objectives of the paper are to determine the prevalence of hemophilic arthropathy among individuals with hemophilia in the northeastern region of Romania, identify the most frequently affected joints, and assess whether there is a correlation between the development of hemophilic arthropathy, the type of hemophilia, and the treatment received. The secondary objectives of the work are to identify a series of particularities regarding the occurrence of the comorbidities depending on the type of hemophilia and the treatment and severity of arthropathies. We conducted a retrospective study that included 36 adults with hemophilia A and B. The status of the osteoarticular system was evaluated using the modified Hemophilia Joint Health Score (mHJHS). Twelve joints were evaluated using the following parameters: swelling, duration of swelling, muscle atrophy, joint pain, crepitus on motion, flexion loss, and extension loss. The most severe damage was found in the joints of the knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. In the knees, severe damage was noted significantly more frequently in the right knee (50% vs. 33.3%; <i>p</i> = 0.001). In the ankles, a higher frequency of mild damage to the left ankle was noted (44.4% vs. 27.8%; <i>p</i> = 0.002). The severe form of hemophilia was correlated with severe joint damage (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, obesity, viral infection (HCV infection), and gastrointestinal disease were found in the hemophilia population of our study. All patients with HCV infection had severe joint damage, while 38.5% of patients without HCV infection had mild joint damage, and 30.8% had no joint damage (<i>p</i> = 0.001). In all patients with HCV virus infection, the treatment was short-term substitution (intermittent prophylaxis), while in 53.8% of patients without HCV virus infection, the treatment consisted of continuous prophylaxis (<i>p</i> = 0.001). It is currently essential to determine methods for comprehensive hemophilia care that involves multidisciplinary medical services necessary for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition and its complications and comorbidities."

    "title": "Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis in Hemophilic Patients Undergoing Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty: Insights from a Single-Center Experience.",
    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Total hip replacement and total knee arthroplasty carry a high risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE); therefore, anticoagulation prophylaxis is recommended in these patients. Unfortunately, there are no guidelines about VTE prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia who underwent these high-risk surgeries. To determine whether these patients have a high risk of VTE, we conducted a retrospective study on patients with hemophilia who underwent elective arthroplasty at our hospital in 2016. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 11 patients with hemophilia A and B who underwent high-risk surgeries. Recombinant factor VIII or IX and also active recombinant Factor VII were used for perioperative hemostasis, and LMWH was administered for thromboembolic prophylaxis. Postoperatively, we collected information on the duration of factor VIII/IX infusion, VTE-prophylaxis, and complications. <i>Results</i>: Postoperative bleeding was minimal in most cases, with an average blood loss of 500 mL. No major thrombotic events were reported, and the need for transfusion was low, with only one patient requiring additional blood products. The VTE prophylaxis included prophylactic enoxaparin and hemostatic treatment. At the 1-year follow-up, we did not find any evidence of clinical VTE in our patients. <i>Conclusions</i>: Better risk stratification is needed to identify patients who would benefit from pharmacological prophylaxis. Total arthroplasty in hemophilic patients is feasible and safe when managed by a multidisciplinary team and supported by tailored antithrombotic prophylaxis protocols. The use of recombinant coagulation factors and LMWH ensures effective bleeding control and thromboembolic prevention, enhancing patient outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of individualized care in this high-risk population."

    "abstract": "Von Willebrand disease (vWD) and hemophilia present unique challenges in orthopedic surgery due to their inherent bleeding risks and potential complications. While joint bleedings are well-documented in hemophilia, they are less understood in vWD, especially regarding their impact on daily activities and the development of arthropathy. We present a case of a young female patient aged 25 years with vWD Type 3 who underwent bilateral total knee replacement (TKR) due to end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Following two previous operations of the right knee at the age of 14, the patient had high degree of extra-articular valgus and intra-articular deformity, ankylosed knee in 30<sup>o</sup> flexion, osteopenia, and chronic patellar dislocation. Bilateral TKR was performed using patient-specific templating (PST) technology, which includes preoperative planning using a CT scan followed by surgical execution. Financial constraints and limited prosthetic resources necessitated a sequential approach to TKR, addressing the more affected right knee first. Despite many challenges, successful outcomes were achieved, with significant improvements in pain, mobility, overall satisfaction, and no complications at two-year follow-up. Our case highlights the importance of individualized treatment strategies, meticulous surgical planning, and postoperative care in managing knee arthropathy patients with bleeding disorders."

    "abstract": "Reverse vaccine formulations have shown their potential for the treatment of allergies and other autoimmune diseases by the design of antigens that modify dendritic cell function towards tolerogenic responses. We here demonstrate that modification of an immunodominant peptide from factor VIII (FVIII) with a tolerizing molecule, sialic acid, improves existing peptide formulations towards the induction of tolerogenic cytokine secretion by DCs. Sialic acids are the end-standing moiety of mammalian N- and O- glycans, which are naturally recognized as self-associated molecular pattern. In this paper we show that sialic acid modified FVIII peptides target Siglec-3 and -9 on DCs and increase IL-10 secretion. Our work proposes a method to select, synthetize and test sialylated immunodominant peptides with the aim of ameliorating the efficacy of peptide immunotherapy. Based on our results, we propose that the sialylated FVIII peptide designed in this study may be useful for re-establishing tolerance to FVIII in hemophilia A patients who developed neutralizing antibodies following treatment."

    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to quantify hemosiderin deposition in the knee joint tissues of hemophilic arthropathy (HA) patients using quantitative susceptibility mapping on MRI. Knee synovial tissues from HA patients and controls without hemophilia were included. The tissues underwent ultrashort echo time quantitative susceptibility mapping (UTE-QSM) and clinical MRI. HA tissues were processed histologically with Perl's Prussian Blue (PPB) staining to identify iron contents. Seven regions of interest were drawn in each tissue, and the susceptibility values were tested. Moreover, the association between the estimated magnetic susceptibility and the iron contents quantified by histology was investigated. Nine synovial tissues were procured from total knee arthroplasty of hemophilia patients (males, 40.8 ± 9.0 years), and three synovial tissues were harvested from cadaveric knee joints of donors without hemophilia as controls (males, 72.0 ± 12.8 years). The estimated susceptibility values (ESVs) showed significant differences between HA and control samples. Accordingly, HA tissues presented a mean ESV of 0.48 ± 1.08 ppm and control tissues of -0.13 ± 0.12 ppm (p < 0.05). A significant linear correlation was found between the iron level quantified by histology (PPB stain) and the ESV estimated by UTE-QSM (R = 0.908, p < 0.01). There was a significant difference in the susceptibility in high load (HL) tissues compared to low load (LL) tissues (ESV = 5.57 ± 1.23 ppm for HL vs. 0.57 ± 0.85 ppm for LL, p < 0.001). Reliable hemosiderin quantification in joint tissues of HA patients can be achieved using MRI based on quantitative susceptibility mapping."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a severe bleeding disorder, sometimes linked to plasma cell dyscrasias. In this context, emicizumab, a bispecific antibody, provides stable hemostasis by mimicking factor VIII (FVIII), offering convenience and flexibility compared to bypassing agents. Moreover, targeted anti-myeloma therapy directly addresses the underlying plasma cell disorder, potentially achieving better and more durable control of AHA than conventional immunosuppressive therapy, while reducing its associated adverse effects. We describe the successful management of AHA secondary to multiple myeloma (MM) using emicizumab and targeted anti-myeloma therapy. The patient initially responded to bortezomib-dexamethasone but required teclistamab due to disease progression. Emicizumab maintained hemostatic stability, allowing time for effective MM management. Emicizumab, in conjunction with targeted myeloma treatment, represents a promising strategy to improve outcomes for AHA patients with MM. This approach is particularly advantageous for older patients with multiple comorbidities, who face elevated risks of thrombotic, bleeding, and infectious complications."

    "abstract": "Inherited bleeding disorders involve prolonged bleeding due to clotting protein deficiencies, with hemophilia A and B being the most common types. The severity of bleeding in people with hemophilia depends on the deficient factor level. Treatment includes coagulation factor concentrates, nonreplacement preparations, gene therapies, and physiotherapy, whereby bleeding is prevented, symptoms are reduced, and the quality of life is improved. Closed kinetic chain exercises improve joint stability and neuromuscular control by stabilizing the proximal base, making them favored in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. Proprioceptive exercise training improves the sensorimotor system's adaptability and injury prevention through tailored programs involving progressively complex movements and surfaces. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of closed kinetic chain exercises and proprioceptive exercise training on improving balance and walking in people with hemophilia. This study is a 3-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with 63 people with hemophilia aged 13-25 years who meet the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome measures are medio-lateral swing, anterior-posterior swing, walking speed, and Hemophilia Joint Health Score. Secondary outcome measures are kinematic assessment of gait, one-leg stand test, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test, proprioception assessment, and the Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia. Participants will be evaluated with the Biodex balance system for postural sway, 10-meters walking test for gait speed, Hemophilia Joint Health Score for joint health, Kinovea 2D motion analysis for kinematic evaluation of gait, one-leg stand test for balance measurement, 6MWD for functional capacity, digital goniometer for proprioception, and Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia for functional independence. Participants will be randomly assigned to a closed kinetic chain exercise group, a proprioceptive exercise group, or a control group. All participants in exercise training groups will receive a 30-minute education session on joint protection techniques and energy conservation prior to the first exercise session. Closed kinetic chain exercises will include progressive lower limb exercises of approximately 45 minutes each session. Proprioceptive exercise training will focus on vibration training; reposition exercises and proprioception exercises will be administered to increase proprioceptive input for the same duration as the other group. The control group will receive no intervention. All participants will undergo 24 exercise sessions (2 days a week for 12 weeks). After the treatment, the initial measurements will be repeated. This study began in September 2023 and is scheduled to be completed in May 2025. A total of 34 participants have completed the study to date. This study will investigate the effects of 2 different exercises on functional parameters in people with hemophilia. The effects of different exercise protocols on parameters such as postural sway, walking speed, and joint health will be evaluated. It is predicted that both exercise methods may have positive effects on balance and gait. Clinical Trials.gov NCT05879549; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05879549. DERR1-10.2196/66770."

    "title": "Disentangling effects of the DR and DQ isomers encoded by the HLA class II haplotype DRB1*15:01/DQB1*06:02 to help establish the true risk allele for FVIII inhibitor development in Hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) patients (HAPs) with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class-II (HLAII) haplotype DRB1*15:01/DQB1*06:02, and thus antigen presenting cells which express HLAII β-polypeptide chains that form heterodimers of DR15- and DQ6-serotypes, respectively, have an increased risk of developing factor (F)VIII inhibitors (FEIs)-neutralizing antibodies against the therapeutic-FVIII-proteins (tFVIIIs) infused to prevent/arrest bleeding. As DRB1*15:01 and DQB1*06:02 exist in strong linkage disequilibrium, association analysis cannot determine which is the actual risk allele. To establish the true risk allele of this haplotype, we analyzed the tFVIII-derived peptides (tFVIII-dPs) bound to either the DR or DQ molecules that comprise the individual HLAII repertoires expressed by monocyte-derived dendritic cells obtained from 25 normal blood donors and six HAPs, four without and two with FEIs. We performed log-linear mixed model analyses, where the dependent variable is the log of the measured peptide count. Under Model 1, we analyzed an HLAII allele predictor consisting of ten levels (four DRB1 and six DQB1 alleles) in the fixed effects and variables in the random effects to account for non-independence. Model 2-where the HLAII allele variable consisted of only DRB1*15:01 and DQB1*06:02-compares the HLAII alleles. Relative to the Model 1 reference, DRB1*15:01 and DQB1*06:02 significantly increased tFVIII-derived peptide counts, and DRB1*15:01 contributed significantly more than DQB1*06:02. Reported as risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) lower- (LB) and upper-bound (UB), we found a RR (95% CI-LB, -UB) of 14.16 (10.38, 19.33) and 1.76 (1.24, 2.50) for DRB1*15:01 and DQB1*06:02, respectively. Under Model 2, we found an RR for DRB1*15:01 against DQB1*06:02 of 7.00 (5.80, 8.44). Our results suggest that DRB1*15:01 is the offending HLAII allele and that DR15 allotypes underlie the increased FEI risk in HAPs."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia 'A' (HA) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by a deficiency of Factor VIII (FVIII), with treatment often triggering the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII. Predicting the development of these inhibitors is crucial for clinical applications but presents significant computational challenges due to data imbalance, skewed data, and inadequate data sanitization. This study aimed to develop a machine-learning/AI approach to find biomarkers and predict the development of inhibitors to Factor VIII in patients with Hemophilia 'A,' addressing the challenges associated with data imbalance and enhancing prediction accuracy. The data were sanitized and encoded for prediction, and the Random Over-sampling (ROS) technique was employed to resolve data imbalance in the CHAMP dataset. Several machine- learning classification models, including Random Forest, XG Boost, Cat Boost, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Light GBM, were utilized. Hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV optimization with a stratified k-fold approach. The performance of the models was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The Random Forest model was further analyzed using an explainable AI (XAI) tool known as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the variables influencing model performance. The Random Forest model outperformed other classifiers, achieving a mean accuracy of 97.37%, along with closely aligned precision, recall, and F1 scores. The XAI tool SHAP facilitated the ranking of variables Clinical Severity, Variant Type, Exon, HGVS cDNA, hg19 Coordinates, and others according to their impact on the model's predictions. Additionally, the study identified biomarkers associated with FVIII inhibition. This study presents a breakthrough in the early prediction of inhibitor development in Hemophilia 'A' patients, paving the way for personalized and effective treatment programs. The integration of the preprocessing pipeline, Random Forest model, and SHAP analysis offers a novel solution for guiding treatment strategies for HA patients, which could significantly enhance the development of targeted and effective therapies."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia, a congenital bleeding disorder, can cause arthropathy, impaired mobility, pain, and life-threatening hemorrhage events, significantly impacting quality of life for patients and caregivers. Current therapies, although effective, necessitate costly lifelong treatment, often in specialized settings. However, as a monogenic disorder caused by loss-of-function genetic variants, hemophilia is amenable to gene therapy. In this article, three primary gene therapy approaches at the forefront of clinical development are reviewed. Adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy, having secured approval in the EU, UK, and US after promising phase 3 trial results, demonstrates clear superiority over standard-of-care treatment. Lentivirus-based approaches capable of transducing dividing and nondividing cells may improve the durability of treatment and have low susceptibility to pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to viral vectors. Finally, gene editing techniques such as zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR aim to correct genetic defects directly, holding promise as novel, effective, and highly durable therapeutic strategies in adults and children with hemophilia. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current status of these gene therapy approaches, highlighting advantages, limitations, and potential future developments."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus-based vector (AAV)-based gene therapy has been used to treat thousands of patients, but a limitation can be inefficient transgene expression from AAV vectors. AAV transduction can be affected by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) system, in which SUMO proteins are attached to proteins after translation, thereby modulating their function and stability. However, to date, practical modulators of SUMOylation to increase AAV vector transgene expression have not been available. Here we demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors of SUMOylation can boost expression from AAV vectors. Treatment with the SUMOylation inhibitor TAK-981 sharply increased AAV transgene expression in transformed human cells, in primary human cells, and in mice. Increased transgene expression in vitro and in vivo was associated with increased mRNA levels per vector DNA template. Treatment of mice with TAK-981 during AAV delivery increased AAV transgene expression; in addition, TAK-981 could boost transgene expression when introduced at long times after initial AAV vector transduction, regardless of whether mice had been exposed to TAK-981 previously. Modulators of SUMOylation are currently in clinical trials in human patients and, thus, may soon represent a viable strategy for boosting AAV transgene expression to improve human gene therapy outcomes."

Severe-HA patients (HAPs) require life-long infusions of therapeutic-FVIII-proteins (tFVIIIs) but ~30% develop neutralizing-tFVIII-antibodies called \"FVIII-inhibitors (FEIs)\". We investigated the genetics underlying the variable risk of FEI-development in 450 North American HAPs (206 and 244 respectively self-reporting black-African- or white-European-ancestry) by analyzing the genotypes of single-nucleotide-variations (SNVs) in candidate immune-mediated-disease (IMD)-genes using a binary linear-mixed model of genetic association with baseline-FEI-status, the dependent variable, while simultaneously accounting for their genetic relationships and heterogeneous-F8-mutations to prevent the statistical problem of non-independence. We a priori selected gene-centric-association-scans of pleiotropic-IMD-genes implicated in the development of either ≥2 autoimmune-/autoinflammatory-disorders (AADs) or FEIs and ≥1 AAD. We found that baseline-FEI-status was significantly associated with NOS2A (rs117382854; p = 3.2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and B3GNT2 (rs10176009; p = 5.1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>)-pleiotropic-IMD-genes known previously to function in anti-microbial-/-tumoral-immunity but not in the development of FEIs-and confirmed associations with CTLA4 (rs231780; p = 2.2 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). We also found that baseline-FEI-status has a substantial heritability (~55%) that involves (i) a F8-mutation-specific component of ~8%, (ii) an additive-genetic contribution from SNVs in IMD-genes of ~47%, and (iii) race, which is a significant determinant independent of F8-mutation-types and non-F8-genetics."

Although periarticular local infiltration analgesia by using a cocktail has been utilized in various surgeries, the efficacy of cocktail administration in HA patients undergoing TKA remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether cocktail therapy can relieve perioperative pain and improve postoperative rehabilitation activities after TKA in HA patients, and whether the addition of corticosteroids to the cocktail is both effective and necessary. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 98 HA patients who underwent TKA at our institution between January 2015 and January 2024. All surgeries were performed by two senior orthopedic surgeons and two assistants from our team, using posterior-stabilized prostheses. The patients were divided into two groups: the experimental group (ropivacaine 100 mg + morphine 10 mg + dexamethasone 35 mg + normal saline 50 ml, n = 45) and the control group (ropivacaine 100 mg + morphine 10 mg + normal saline 50 ml, n = 53). A three-month follow-up study was conducted to compare the postoperative outcomes in the above groups, including Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, knee range of motion (ROM), Knee Society Score (KSS), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, CRP, and Interleukin- 6, IL- 6), and hospitalization parameters (body temperature, length of hospital stay, hospitalization costs, and perioperative usage of coagulation factor VIII). Both groups improved knee joint function and reduced post-operative pain at the last follow-up. With knee ROM increasing from 47.22° to 95.36° and KSS increasing from 35.42 to 82.02, the experimental group's VAS ratings dropped from 4.31 to 1.47. Besides, the control group's VAS scores dropped from 4.71 to 2.09, knee ROM increased from 45.95° to 91.60°, and KSS from 36.87 to 80.40 (all with P < 0.05). Throughout the follow-up, the experimental group showed better pain reduction (P < 0.05), with greater knee ROM and KSS within the first month compared to the control group. This difference diminished by the third month, but the experimental group still showed higher knee ROM and KSS. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited lower inflammation markers and a shorter hospital stay (P < 0.05). In people with hemophilia undergoing TKA the cocktail of ropivacaine 100 mg + morphine 10 mg + nomal saline 50 mL + 35 mg dexamethasone seemed to be more effective in relieving postoperative pain than the cocktail of ropivacaine 100 mg + morphine 10 mg + nomal saline 50 mL at 3-month follow-up."

Field study sample kits with plasma AT activity levels (100, 36, 14 and 9 IU/dL or % of normal) were created and distributed to global haemostasis laboratories. Values were assigned based on Siemens INNOVANCE AT activity assay using BCS-XP analyser. Reliability (relative accuracy estimate), intra- and inter-laboratory variability of IVDs in measuring AT activity in plasma samples using various commercially available AT assays was assessed. At normal AT activity level (i.e., 100%), all AT assays reliably measured AT activity with acceptable recovery. Accurate results were observed for all samples across sites using Siemens INNOVANCE AT assay. Increased variability was observed for all other assays at low AT levels. Siemens Berichrom and Stago STA-Stachrom assays accurately measured 100% and 36% AT activity; however, lab-to-lab variability was observed for ≤15% AT activity (CV >20%). All laboratories for the Stago STA-Stachrom assay failed to measure 9% AT activity. The HemosIL assay significantly underestimated AT activity levels ≤36%. There were no reported values for the 14% and 9% AT samples. Siemens INNOVANCE AT assay can reliably measure AT activity at clinical decision points of 15-35% of normal and is most suitable for clinical management of patients taking fitusiran."

Retrospective clinical and imaging data were collected from HA patients registered at the Henan Provincial Registration Management Center of Haemophilia from December 2010 to May 2023. The inclusion criteria were joints with a history of haemorrhage and initial/posttreatment reevaluation with X-ray and MRI. Joints with severe damage (i.e., a Pettersson score > 6) were excluded. Joint disease progression was defined as a > 1-point increase in the Pettersson score. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary outcome. MRI observations revealed joint effusion, synovial hypertrophy, haemosiderin deposition, bone destruction or cystic degeneration at the joint margins, and cartilage destruction. Age, body mass index (BMI), factor VIII (FVIII) activity, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), therapy type, annual joint bleeding rate (AJBR), and the Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) were also assessed. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to analyse the clinical and imaging characteristics influencing HA progression. Factors with a P < 0.15 in univariate analysis were subsequently included in the multivariate analysis. The impact of various imaging and clinical characteristics on PFS was assessed via Kaplan‒Meier (K-M) survival curves. This study included 98 joints across 65 patients. During the follow-up period, 63 joints exhibited progression. Both univariate and multivariate Cox analyses revealed that MRI-detected synovial hypertrophy (MRI-SP) was an independent risk factor for HA progression. Incorporating BMI into the model improved its predictive performance (Model 1: c-index = 0.671, P < 0.01). Spearman's correlation analysis revealed strong correlations between baseline MRI-SP and detected haemosiderin deposition (r = 0.73) as well as AJBRs (r = 0.66). K-M survival curves indicated that patients receiving prophylactic treatment and those with less severe MRI-SP had better progression-free survival. MRI-detected synovial hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for HA progression. The predictive model, which includes BMI as a covariate for assessing the risk of HA progression, can serve as an auxiliary tool for developing personalized treatment plans for HA patients."

    "abstract": "Muscle haematomas in patients with mild haemophilia may present differently to patients with severe haemophilia on prophylactic treatments. Bleeding in mild haemophilia is often related to surgery, invasive procedures, trauma and sporting injuries; a delay in presentation and treatment is common due to the lack of awareness of the seriousness of the condition. We discuss the management of an early adolescent male with a known mild haemophilia A diagnosis who presented to the hospital following blunt trauma to his thigh. Ultrasound demonstrated a large quadriceps intramuscular haematoma, which could increase the risk for compartment syndrome if not treated promptly or adequately. In this case, delayed treatment resulted in an inpatient admission and lengthy rehabilitation. This case report documents the multidisciplinary management, considering the medical, surgical, nursing, physiotherapy and medical imaging aspects of this presentation that effectively guided rehabilitation and return to sport complication-free."

To find effectiveness of MFT and traditional physiotherapy with intermittent prophylaxis on short-term improvement of joint health in hemophilic arthropathy. Thirty-one patients with Hemophilia A and joint arthropathy (elbows and/or knees) were randomly divided into MFT group (MFT + traditional physiotherapy) and control group (traditional physiotherapy). Both groups received four physiotherapy sessions per week for three weeks and FVIII prophylaxis twice weekly. Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), Functional Independence Scoring for Haemophilia (FISH), and Range of Motion (ROM) were assessed on Day 0, 10, 21. MFT group demonstrated a significant improvement in their overall HJHS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.016, d = 0.93) and HJHS knee joint scores (<i>p</i> = 0.007, d = 0.57) compared to control group participants. ROM increased substantially in MFT group relative to control group (18.97%; 10.10% improvement in knee and elbow ROM, respectively, vs 9.49%; 1.25%). There was an improvement in FISH scores in both groups, with a slightly greater improvement in control group (13.68% vs 11.08%). MFT is effective and feasible in short-term improvement of joint health in Hemophilia A patients with elbow and knee arthropathy."

However, evidence to support clinical decision-making in this context remains limited, despite its growing importance. To develop Canadian consensus recommendations for managing PWH requiring ATT. A modified Delphi technique was used. Initial statements were generated using information from a scoping literature review and focus groups with Canadian haemophilia experts. Key areas included risk assessment, tailored treatment planning, ATT selection and management of breakthrough bleeding. Expert panellists were recruited through the Association of Haemophilia Clinic Directors of Canada using convenience sampling. Participants independently reviewed and rated each statement using a 7-point agreement-based Likert scale, with consensus defined a priori as over 70% agreement among panellists. Statements that did not reach consensus in the first round were modified based on participants' comments. Eight physicians (median experience in PWH care: 11.0 years) from five haemophilia treatment centres across four Canadian provinces participated. All panellists had experience managing thromboembolic complications and using ATTs in PWH. Consensus was attained for 32 statements on general aspects of care, risk assessment, treatment planning and management of bleeding complications. All statements attained consensus after two rounds with a 100% completion rate. This Canadian study yielded 32 consensus-based recommendations for managing PWH requiring ATT, addressing an unmet need to guide clinical decision-making in this complex and evolving area."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of arthropathy in people with moderate hemophilia A (mHA) is highly variable. People with mHA are often undertreated, and this may lead to joint damage and worsen their quality of life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate joint status in mHA by means of point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) and clinical examination. Consecutive people with mHA receiving on-demand replacement treatment underwent a clinical examination of joint status according to the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) protocol. On the same day, all patients underwent a PoCUS assessment according to the Hemophilia Early Detection by UltraSound (HEAD-US) protocol. A total of 51 subjects were included. The median HJHS score was 2.0 (IQR, 0-3.0). A 0 to 1 HJHS score was found in 23 people with mHA (45.1%), between 2 and 3 in 17 (33.3%) and >3 in 11 (21.6%). The median HEAD-US score was 2.0 (IQR, 1-7), and a statistically significant correlation between HJHS and HEAD-US was found (rho = 0.732; <i>P</i> < .001). Osteochondral damage was found in 21.6% of patients, and hypertrophic synovium (HS) was found in 29.4%. Among those reporting a 0 to 1 HJHS score, 13.0% showed HS. Analysis at the joint level showed that the most commonly affected joint was the ankle, both for osteochondral damage and the presence of HS. Our study suggests that the prevalence of arthropathy changes in people with mHA receiving on-demand treatment is not negligible and that PoCUS is able to detect osteochondral damage as well as HS in this clinical setting. A more extensive screening of the joint status could be useful to tailor treatment and improve outcomes in mHA."

    "abstract": "Advances in hemophilia treatment have reduced bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia (PWH) and improved their musculoskeletal prognosis; however, complete prevention of musculoskeletal disorders has not been achieved. Recently, the usefulness of ultrasound (US) examinations in the musculoskeletal assessment of PWH has been reported, but the actual use of US has been suggested to be limited. The aim of this study was to clarify the extent to which US is being performed on young male PWH at medical institutions in Japan. This was an observational study using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan. We identified almost all male PWH aged under 30 years who were prescribed hemostatic agents between 2015 and 2021 in Japan. For each year, we calculated the proportion of PWH who underwent US and, as a sensitivity analysis, the proportion of PWH who underwent US examinations for musculoskeletal disease. The Cochran‒Armitage trend test was used to examine changes in the number of PWH who underwent US examinations over the observation period. The Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients were calculated from the proportion of US examinations performed at each medical institution annually. A total of 2137-2483 male PWH younger than 30 years were identified annually. The annual proportion of PWH who underwent US ranged from 6.1 to 12.9%. By age group, the annual proportions of US were 6.7-14.4%, 8.1-16.6%, and 2.0-8.7% for 0-9, 10-19, and 20-29 years, respectively. The annual proportions of musculoskeletal US were 2.9-7.7%. The proportion of PWH who underwent US increased significantly over the seven-year period; however, it varied by medical institution (Gini coefficients 0.85-0.92). The use of US for young PWH is becoming more widespread in Japan. However, US is performed at different rates among medical institutions."

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based targeted gene editing platforms are being developed to treat genetic diseases like hemophilia. Such novel therapy involves complex concepts and terminology that require aligned language to engage key stakeholders in the hemophilia community. Thus, a globally aligned gene editing lexicon - a consistent language to communicate the fundamentals of gene editing in hemophilia, designed to be credible and accessible for people with hemophilia and caregivers while avoiding unnecessary complexity - is required to address this need. To establish an aligned language and communications framework that facilitates informed consent and shared decision-making regarding gene editing and treatment considerations in hemophilia. Through an innovative partnership with global experts in hemophilia, gene editing, and biotechnology, initial insights were gathered via interviews, workshops, and analysis of existing language within the hemophilia community. Qualitative research involving lived experience experts (people with hemophilia and caregivers; <i>n</i> = 43) and hematologists (<i>n</i> = 24) informed the lexicon development, which was further validated by a steering committee of global experts in the hemophilia and gene editing fields. Finally, optimized language recommendations were developed for a clear, consistent gene editing lexicon. Key themes included insights into audience mindsets, guiding language principles, and optimized terminology for key topics like gene editing concepts and posttreatment considerations. Audience mindsets revealed cautious optimism around gene therapy, with more skepticism around gene editing. Guiding language principles indicated a preference for plainspoken over technical language, definitions that link to patient benefits, and explanations that highlight the precise nature of gene editing. This collaborative approach ensures broad adoption of the lexicon within the hemophilia community and readiness for beta testing."

    "abstract": "Drug trials are vital to establish safe and effective treatments for congenital hemophilia, a bleeding disorder that affects about 800,000 males worldwide. The global distribution of hemophilia drug trials (HDTs) and their alignment with hemophilia care is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the global distribution of HDTs and its association with hemophilia care. In this cross-sectional study, HDTs conducted between 2007 and 2022 were selected from the clinicaltrials.gov database. The density of trials per 1000 expected males with hemophilia (eMwH) was assessed according to hemophilia care measures (factor VIII and IX utilization per 1000 eMwH) derived from World Federation of Hemophilia data. Among 124 trials, 55 countries were represented, with an average of 7.9 countries per trial. Most HDT sites were in high-income (74.4%) or upper middle (20.1%)-income countries. The number of sites in lower-middle-income countries doubled, from 12 in 2007-2011 to 30 in 2017-2022-a nonsignificant increase from 5.8% to 7.0% (<i>P</i> = .53). Factor utilization was substantially reduced in lower-middle (0.4 international units [IUs] per 1000 eMwH) and upper middle (2.8 IUs per 1000 eMwH) compared with high (6.8 IUs per 1000 eMwH) income countries. HDT density was moderately correlated with factor usage (<i>r</i> = 0.436; <i>P</i> ≤ .001). Most HDT sites were located in high-income countries, although a substantial proportion were in upper middle-income countries. A small but increasing number of trials were conducted in lower-middle-income countries, where factor usage is relatively low. This study provides evidence on the global distribution of HDT and raises questions regarding the generalizability, barriers, opportunities, and ethics of trials for a rare bleeding disorder."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a coagulation disorder caused by deficiencies in clotting factors and is primarily classified into hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Current treatment relies predominantly on replacement therapy, where patients receive clotting factor concentrates either episodically or prophylactically to achieve hemostasis or mitigate bleeding risks. Despite its efficacy, this approach presents limitations, including suboptimal treatment accessibility due to high costs, reduced patient compliance from frequent intravenous administration, and therapeutic failure in patients developing plasma inhibitors. These challenges underscore the need for novel therapeutics addressing unmet clinical demands. On March 28, 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved fitusiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic for hemophilia. This first-in-class agent demonstrates pan-hemophilia efficacy by targeting antithrombin to enhance thrombin activity, irrespective of factor VIII/IX deficiency status or plasma inhibitor presence. By pioneering a mechanism of antithrombin suppression, enabling sustained therapeutic action, and facilitating precision monitoring protocols, fitusiran has the potential to redefine hemophilia treatment paradigms."

With the injection of TF<sup>high</sup> microvesicles, IVC clots were rarely found in hemophilic mice. The TF<sup>low</sup> and TF<sup>KO</sup> microvesicles resulted in few IVC clots in any mouse. Lung thrombosis was substantially reduced in the hemophilic mice infused with any microvesicle type. In orthotopic tumor models, TF<sup>high</sup> cells grew faster than did TF<sup>low</sup> cells.

With the current innovations in hemophilia treatments, the use of patient-reported bleeding data will become increasingly important. To assess real-world bleeding rates on emicizumab in a nationwide cohort of people with severe hemophilia A, and assess the value of digital treatment diary data. People with severe hemophilia A of all ages with and without inhibitors using emicizumab who use the digital treatment diary were included. From 2018 to October 2023, data on bleeds treated with clotting factor concentrate were collected from digital treatment diaries and electronic health records. Mean (95% CI) annualized (joint) bleeding rates were calculated using negative-binomial regression analyses. Proportions of people with zero-treated (joint) bleeds were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We calculated the proportion of all bleeds that were recorded in digital treatment diaries. The 232 included persons (median age, 27 years; IQR, 13-51) who used emicizumab for a median of 27 months (IQR, 14-31 months). The mean treated annualized bleeding rate and annualized joint bleeding rate were 1.5 (CI, 1.3-1.8) and 0.8 (CI, 0.6-1.0), respectively. At 24 weeks, 63% had zero-treated bleeds, and 80% had zero-treated joint bleeds. Of treated bleeds, 67% (310/460) were reported in digital treatment diaries. Bleeding rates among Dutch people with severe hemophilia A using emicizumab were comparable to other real-world studies. We formulated recommendations to improve the quality of patient-reported bleeding data, such as establishing guidelines for recording bleeds and improving interoperability."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A is a chronic life-threatening condition caused by deficiency or dysfunction of plasma coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and commonly managed by prophylaxis with regular infusion of FVIII protein. A major obstacle to FVIII replacement therapy is the generation of alloantibodies that diminish efficacy. Disulfide bonds link pairs of cysteine residues in proteins and in several proteins have been found to be only partially formed in the mature proteins. FVIII contains 8 disulfide bonds and their redox state in human blood and recombinant FVIII was determined using differential cysteine alkylation and mass spectrometry. All 8 disulfide bonds were found to be unformed in ~10% to ~70% of molecules of FVIII populations, which suggested a conformational flexibility that could favour binding of certain ligands to subsets of FVIII with more or less formed disulfide bonds. To test this hypothesis, the binding of a panel of five patient-derived anti-FVIII antibodies to the population of FVIII disulfide-bonded states was evaluated. All five antibodies bound preferentially to FVIII states where 2 or 3 of the 8 disulfides are significantly more unformed; C1918-C1922 in the A3 domain, C2040-C2188 in the C1 domain and C2193-C2345 in the C2 domain. Disulfide bond mutagenesis experiments and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this subset of FVIII states have long-range conformational dynamism that favours anti-drug antibody binding. These findings will assist efforts to engineer a FVIII molecule that is less prone to neutralization by anti-drug antibodies and has general implications for autoimmune conditions and antibody drug efficacy."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia, an X-linked genetic bleeding disorder, is caused by the deficiency of coagulation factors VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B). Regular replacement therapy with the missing clotting factor is an effective standard-of-care treatment. However, it comes with a significant fallout of frequent intravenous dosing with poor compliance, the risk of inhibitor development, and a substantial treatment burden. Research has progressed from missing clotting factors and factor VIII mimetics to the most recent rebalancing therapy that suppresses tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Thrombin generation is restricted by TFPI, which inhibits the tissue factor-mediated activation of factor VII. This promising therapeutic approach rebalances hemostasis by inhibiting TFPI, a critical regulator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, thereby increasing thrombin generation. Novel monoclonal antibodies (concizumab and marstacimab) enhance thrombin generation by blocking TFPI to restore hemostasis. Clinical trials have demonstrated good clinical efficacy and safety of these anti-TFPI, besides their convenient subcutaneous administration using pen devices. These innovative therapies have the potential to enhance the quality of life (QoL) of people with hemophilia. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical development, therapeutic potential, challenges, and prospects of anti-TFPI in the management of hemophilia."

In vitro global assay data on the effects of concomitant coagulation factor agents in the presence of NXT007, an emicizumab-based engineered bispecific antibody under clinical development, may serve as a basis for addressing this potential risk. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of recombinant factor (rF)VIII, rFVIIa, and APCC during NXT007 treatment and estimate tolerable doses with reference to emicizumab. Thrombin generation assays, clot waveform analysis, and rotational thromboelastometry were performed using hemophilia A plasma and blood samples spiked with NXT007 and others. A single dose of NXT007 at ≥10.0 μg/mL (plasma) achieved a nonhemophiliac coagulation potential. The concomitant addition of rFVIII, rFVIIa, and APCC each boosted various parameters following NXT007 levels at 0.1 to 50.0 μg/mL. In the copresence of NXT007 at 15.0 μg/mL (blood) and APCC at 0.13 U/mL, with the blood level immediately following the administration of 10.0 U/kg, the rotational thromboelastometry parameters were comparable with those observed with clinical emicizumab level and APCC at 0.63 U/mL, corresponding to the blood level immediately after administrating 50.0 U/kg (recommended initial dose). Concomitant addition of coagulation agents increased coagulation potentials in vitro in the presence of NXT007. A dose of 10.0 U/kg may serve as a rough indicator for the initial dose when exploring the concomitant use of APCC at plasma NXT007 levels of ∼30.0 μg/mL. Importantly, plasma NXT007 at ≥10.0 μg/mL demonstrated non-hemophiliac coagulation potentials in vitro."

    "title": "Antithrombotic therapy in patients with inherited bleeding disorders: practical considerations.",
    "abstract": "For decades hemophilia and allied bleeding disorders caused by inherited deficiency of clotting factors have been considered conditions protecting against thromboembolism (TE). This opinion was coined over 60 years ago, when average life expectancy of people with hemophilia (PWH) was below 30 years, long‑term antihemorrhagic prophylaxis of bleeding episodes was unattainable, and the main cause of premature death of PWH were life‑threatening bleeds. At that time, arterial or venous thromboembolism were simply not observed among people with inherited bleeding disorders. With the progress of hemophilia management leading to improved hemostasis, resulting in reduction of severity and frequency of bleeding episodes and longer life expectancy, it became obvious that hemophilia patients may and do develop TE episodes. This review is focused on how to manage arterial and venous TE in people with inherited bleeding disorders. Anticoagulant therapy should be avoided in severe or moderate hemophilia without antihemorrhagic prophylaxis. Use of anticoagulants at therapeutic doses is safer when plasma activity of factor (F) VIII or FIX is permanently equal to or above 20 IU/dl rather than below 20 IU/dl. Taking into account their efficacy, safety profile, and convenience, direct oral anticoagulants are the first choice as oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation as well as in venous TE treatment in PWH. PWH may be offered many treatment options that allow to minimize exposure to antithrombotic agents, for example, cardioversion, catheter ablation, left atrial appendage occlusion, newer-generation drug‑eluting stents, bioprosthetic heart valves, or mechanical thromboprophylaxis methods."

By employing a synergistic approach that combines direct relation graph with error propagation, chemical lumping, quasi-steady-state assumption, and conservation analysis, the method efficiently reduces the complexity of original coagulation models without compromising accuracy. Applied to both extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathway schemes, this approach significantly diminishes the number of species and reactions, and the resulting reduced schemes appear to be robust to changes in initial conditions relevant to hemophilia A. The findings underscore the potential of this reduction method to facilitate more efficient computational simulations that retain the essential characteristics of different coagulation models."

    "abstract": "The role of public health has evolved from addressing infectious diseases to encompass non-communicable diseases. Individuals with genetic disorders and rare diseases constitute a particularly vulnerable population, requiring tailored public health policies, practical implementation strategies, and a long-term vision to ensure sustainable support. Given the prolonged duration and significant costs often associated with these conditions, comprehensive, patient-centered, and cost-effective approaches are essential to safeguard their physical and mental well-being. To summarize definitions and concepts related to health, public health, rare diseases, and to highlight the role of integrating public health interventions into routine care in improving patient outcomes. Hemophilia was selected as an exemplary rare disease due to its significant lifetime treatment costs and the recent approval and pricing of its gene therapy as the world's most expensive drug, highlighting the critical importance of public health policies in ensuring equitable access to care and treatment. A narrative literature review was conducted between July 2023 and December 2024, searching PubMed, Google Scholar, and Google for various topics related to rare diseases, public health, and hemophilia. Public health can play an important role in improving the health outcomes of people with rare diseases by implementing conceptual and applied models to accomplish a set of objectives. Over the past two decades, legislative and regulatory support in high income countries (HICs) has facilitated the development and approval of diagnostics and treatments for several rare diseases leading to important advancements. In contrast, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face obstacles in enacting legislation, developing regulations, and implementing policies to support rare disease diagnosis and treatment. More investment and innovation in drug discovery and market access pathways are still needed in both LMICs and HICs. Ensuring the translation of public health policies into regulatory measures, and in turn implementing, and regularly evaluating these measures to assess their effectiveness is crucial. In the case of hemophilia, public health can play a pivotal role. Enhancing public health surveillance, policies, and interventions in hemophilia and other rare diseases can bridge data gaps, support access to equitable treatment, promote evidence-based care, and improve outcomes across the socioeconomic spectrum."

While predictors for remission have been analyzed, data on recurrence is lacking. This study investigated predictors of AHA recurrence in 41 patients. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with recurrence (<i>n</i> = 18) and those in stable long-term remission (<i>n</i> = 23) with at least 1 year of follow-up. All relapses occurred within 1 year of initial remission. The median follow-up period was 3.8 years (IQR, 1.8-6.4) for all included patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that initial FVIII activity <1 IU/dL and failure to achieve initial complete remission (CR) were significant predictors of relapse. Kaplan-Meier curves showed significantly different relapse-free survival rates for patients with initial FVIII activity <1 IU/dL vs ≥1 IU/dL (χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = 5.950, <i>P</i> = .015), and for those achieving initial CR vs partial remission (χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = 6.570, <i>P</i> = .010).Other factors such as inhibitor titer, gender, age, World Health Organization scale, underlying disorder, controlled disorder, initial immunosuppressive therapy, immunosuppressive therapy escalation, and partial remission at day 21 showed no significant relation to recurrences. Overall survival did not differ significantly between relapsing and nonrelapsing patients (χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = .896, <i>P</i> = .344). Initial FVIII <1 IU/dL and failure to achieve initial CR are identified as risk factors for recurrence in AHA. Patients with these characteristics should be closely monitored for at least 1 year after initial remission due to increased recurrence risk."

    "abstract": "Desmopressin increases plasma factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in non-severe hemophilia A (Hem A) and type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD), following intravenous infusions, subcutaneous injections or nasal spray. This medication, with almost 50 years of clinical experience and proven safety and efficacy, is often unavailable. Thus, there is a need to establish how many patients can benefit from it and how many bleeding episodes can be treated. We reviewed the literature to estimate the global prevalence of symptomatic patients with VWD type 1 and non-severe Hem A, the incidence in them of bleeds and the rate of responsiveness to desmopressin. Real world data indicate that 1.7 patients with VWD per 100,000 seek care in specialized centers. Of them, 1.15 per 100,000 have type 1 VWD and 80% are reported to respond to desmopressin. In type 1 the estimated frequency of bleeds treatable with desmopressin are 2.5 events per patient year. Non-severe cases are 45% of all Hem A cases, with a much lower incidence of bleeds than in severe disease (0.4 events/patient/year). Based on epidemiology, data on the rates of bleeding and desmopressin responsiveness, we estimated that 84,000 people with VWD type 1 would benefit from desmopressin to treat 210,000 yearly bleeds, and that 81,000 people with non-severe Hem A can be yearly treated for 13,000 bleeds. Desmopressin is an essential therapeutic tool in non-severe Hem A and type 1 VWD that can treat more than 220,000 bleeding episodes successfully, safely and economically also in low-income settings with poor access to costly replacement therapies."

    "title": "Consistent clinical factor VIII equivalency is unlikely for non-factor therapies in hemophilic mice.",
    "abstract": "Non-factor therapies are changing the treatment paradigm in hemophilia A, which was previously dominated by replacement-therapy using factor VIII (FVIII)-concentrates. However, the FVIIIequivalence of these new therapies has remained unclear, since in vitro assays generate variable responses. Here we used four different in vivo bleeding models to compare FVIII to emicizumab and to a sequence-identical analogue of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor-targeting antibody marstacimab (SIA-marstacimab). The severity of these models was variable, each requiring different doses of FVIII needed to reduce blood loss to levels of wild-type mice. For instance, a dose of 2.5 IU/kg FVIII was needed for full correction in the tail vein transection (TVT)-model, whereas 25 IU/kg was needed in the saphenous vein puncture (SVP)-model. Intermediate doses were required in the tail artery transection (TAT)-model (5 IU/kg) and tail clip-model (7.5 IU/kg). Importantly, FVIII treatment produced stable clots, without spontaneous rebleeds being observed. Both emicizumab and SIA-marstacimab (used at therapeutic doses of 55 microgram/ml and 16 microgram/ml, respectively) displayed a variable, model-dependent FVIII-equivalence. For example, emicizumab proved equivalent to 5 IU/kg FVIII in the tail clip-model, and to 10 IU/kg in the SVP-model. Strikingly, both emicizumab- and SIA-marstacimab-treatment resulted in spontaneous rebleeds in the TVT-, TAT- and tail-clip-models, further distinguishing them from FVIII-treatment. Our data suggest that a single FVIIIequivalence is unlikely to exist for emicizumab, SIA-marstacimab and similar molecules, because their activity is dependent on local conditions and severity of the injury."

To report trends in treatment for severe haemophilia and concomitant changes in inhibitor incidence. Between 2008 and 2022, 97 centres reported inhibitor development against FVIII/IX concentrates to the European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance System (EUHASS). Inhibitors were reported quarterly, and PUPs without inhibitor development annually. Cumulative inhibitor incidences (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were calculated for PUPs and incidence rates/1000 years (CI) for PTPs. By 2022, SHA-PUPs (n = 1574) received emicizumab (44%), SHL-rFVIII (21.5%), pdFVIII (17.5%) and EHL-rFVIII (17%). SHB-PUPs (n = 236) received EHL-rFIX (79%) and SHL-rFIX (21%). SHA-PTPs (68,772 years) received EHL-rFVIII (31%), SHL-rFVIII (28%), emicizumab (25%), and pdFVIII (15%). SHB PTPs (11,185 years) received EHL-rFIX (69%), pdFIX (15%) and SHL-rFIX (15%). Observed Inhibitor incidence in SHA-PUPs decreased from 24% before 2016 to 6% in 2022 (p < 0.001), and potentially in SHB-PUPs too (from 9% to 3%; p = 0.066), but remained stable in SHA/SHB PTPs. In 2022, 44% of SHA-PUPs and 25% of SHA-PTPs received emicizumab prophylaxis. Concomitantly, observed inhibitor incidence reduced to 6% in SHA-PUPs. In SHB, EHL-rFIX treatment increased to 79% in SHB-PUPs and 69% in SHB-PTPs. Assessing inhibitor incidence for new concentrates is likely to be hampered by novel treatments causing delayed exposure to FVIII/FIX."

Previously, these options were assessed using a Peterson score-based model to simulate joint damage over time. This study built a model for the economic evaluation of hemophilia A with less socioeconomic selection bias utilizing the hemophilia joint health score (HJHS). A mechanistically defined HJHS-based state-transition microsimulation model was implemented for the cost-utility analysis conducted over a lifetime horizon from a Canadian provincial Ministry of Health perspective, with a 1.5% discount rate on (costs and outcomes), to compare the following interventions: standard half-life (SHL), extended half-life (EHL), emicizumab, and efanesocotog alfa (EA). The health states are HJHS levels, waiting for surgery, postoperative time, and death. Individuals experience bleeds, joint bleeds (increasing the HJHS), and surgery in each health state. Disutilities include injections and postoperative time. Model validation included face validity, internal validity, comparison analysis, external validity, and predictive validity. Probabilistic analysis, pricing threshold analysis, and one-way scenario analyses were completed. EA showed lower levels of hospitalizations and surgeries and an improved joint damage experience in the simulation. However, EA was not cost-effective against emicizumab, which continued to be the most cost-effective intervention. Pricing threshold analysis indicated that a price decrease would be required for EA to dominate SHL (50% decrement) and emicizumab (55% decrement). This is the first cost-effectiveness model incorporating HJHS to apply sequential joint damage to hemophilia A. While EA offers clinical benefits, our analysis suggests it will not be cost-effective from a Canadian provincial Ministry of Health perspective without a significant price decrease."

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of glycopegylated extended half-life (EHL) clotting factors in patients with hemophilia A and B. A retrospective observational design was employed, including 25 patients aged ≥18 years with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B who transitioned to EHL therapy. Hemophilia A patients (n=19) switched from standard half-life (SHL) factor VIII (FVIII) to weekly EHL FVIII prophylaxis, while hemophilia B patients (n=6) transitioned from on-demand SHL factor IX (FIX) to glycopegylated EHL FIX prophylaxis every 21 days. Outcomes were assessed through the annual bleeding rate (ABR), functional independence score in hemophilia (FISH score), and hemophilia joint health score (HJHS). A subset analysis for quality of life (QoL) was also performed on hemophilia A patients using the Haem-A-QoL questionnaire in patients with hemophilia A. Glycopegylated EHL FVIII therapy significantly reduced ABR and improved joint health and functional scores over 24 months (p<0.001). Hemophilia B patients demonstrated a significant reduction in ABR and joint bleeding rates at eight months (p<0.05). The study found that prophylaxis with individualized doses of glycopegylated EHL factors is not only effective in reducing bleeding episodes and improving joint health but also safe with improved treatment adherence, offering a viable prophylactic option in resource-constrained settings."

    "abstract": "Management of patients with hemophilia in healthcare resource limited countries is challenging for healthcare providers. Thai patients with hemophilia initially received episodic treatment of cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in 1965. Home treatment using cryoprecipitate at early bleeding episodes was initiated in 1979 and replaced with fresh dry plasma in 1982. Heat-treated, lyophilized cryoprecipitate commenced in 1997, and factor concentrate was imported for clinical use in 2000. A healthy diet, limit weight gain and exercise for the prominent vein constitute a commitment among every hemophiliac. National advocacy of home treatment using factor concentrates at early bleeding episodes started in 2006 and nationwide low-dose prophylaxis in 2018. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) was initially attempted in 1997. The dental splint was invented as a local measure for dental procedures in 1979, and fibrin glue has been applied to surgical sites. A computerized program for hereditary bleeding disorders registry was initiated in 1999 and became nationwide in 2020. Finally, nationwide nonfactor therapy of monthly low-dose emicizumab prophylaxis will be established soon. Hemophilia care in Thailand constitutes the real-world experience passing from generation to generation for five decades using our limited resources efficiently."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder associated with an economic burden for patients and their caregivers. This study, called HemiValue, consists in a budget impact model to assess the benefits for patients and the budgetary impact of this shift to dual dispensing for all stakeholders involved, comparing the cost and time savings from the patients' perspective and from the pharmacies' perspective. The impact of the dual dispensing circuit over one year was evaluated from the patients' perspective, the evaluation included costs, travel and waiting times related to obtaining the treatment, as well as associated income losses. The analysis also included perspectives from hospital pharmacies (HP), community pharmacies (CP), and ecological considerations. On an individual level, the availability of emicizumab in CP reduced the time spent obtaining this treatment by the equivalent of 3 working days per year. The 322 euros difference in direct costs per year represents a reduction in the proportion of costs relative to the available income of families from 2.6% to 0.2%. This reduction was more pronounced for low-income households and those living more than 30 min from a HP. The dual dispensing circuit reduces the financial and logistical burdens associated with obtaining emicizumab. These results highlight the importance of innovative dispensing models that aim to ease constraints for patients and their caregivers while working towards greater equity in accessibility."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked chronic bleeding disorder due to deficiency of the coagulation factor VIII. According to the residual level of FVIII activity, patients can present with severe (FVIII levels <1 %), moderate (1-5 %) or mild (6-40 %) phenotypes. While long-term prophylaxis is the current standard of care and has been shown to be effective in minimizing bleeding episodes, episodes of hemarthrosis, that could lead to arthropathy and disability, are still reported. This systematic review aimed to evaluate available data concerning current treatment outcomes in severe hemophilia A patients without inhibitors in Brazil, focusing on the frequency of bleeding episodes and adherence to therapy of patients under prophylactic treatment. A literature search strategy was used in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, LILACS and SciElo databases from 2014 onwards, since it was the moment that prophylaxis effectively became available in the Brazilian National Health Service, even though prophylactic treatment had been officially incorporated in 2011 focused on concerning bleeding episodes and adherence rate of this population. Searches yielded 536 articles. After removal of duplicates, 417 articles were screened for eligibility. Eventually, 104 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Finally, only five publications met eligibility criteria and were selected for the descriptive review. Available information on efficacy of severe hemophilia A management in Brazil currently relies on scarce and possibly biased information. It should be strongly emphasized that Brazil is in great need of a structured and coordinated effort to improve collection, analysis, and reporting of data on hemophilia A patients."

The liver has been and continues as a prime target for in vivo gene therapy due to its essential biological functions, vascular access to the major target cell (hepatocytes), and relatively immunotolerant environment. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have become the cornerstone of liver-directed therapies, demonstrating remarkable success in conditions such as hemophilia A and B, with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies like etranacogene dezaparvovec, Beqvez, and Roctavian marking milestones in the field. Despite these advances, challenges persist, including vector immunogenicity, species-specific barriers, and high manufacturing costs. Innovative strategies, such as capsid engineering, immune modulation, and novel delivery systems, are continuing to address these issues in expanding the scope of therapeutic applications. Some of the challenges with many new therapies result in the discordance between preclinical success and translation into humans. The advent of various genome-editing tools to repair genomic mutations or insert therapeutic DNAs into precise locations in the genome further enhances the potential for a single-dose medicine that will offer durable life-long therapeutic treatments. As advancements accelerate, liver-targeted gene therapy is poised to continue to transform the treatment landscape for both genetic and acquired disorders, for which unmet challenges remain."

    "abstract": "Realistic paths to gene therapy for the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia started to materialize in the mid 1990s, resulting in disease correction in small and large animal models. Out of a diversity of approaches, in vivo adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer to hepatocytes emerged as the most promising strategy, eventually forming the basis for multiple advanced clinical trials and regulatory approval of two products for the treatment of hemophilia B (coagulation factor IX deficiency) and one for hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency). Ideally, gene therapy is effective with a single administration, thus providing therapeutic factor levels over a period of years, without the need for frequent injections. Overcoming multiple obstacles, some not predicted by preclinical studies, sustained partial to complete correction of coagulation for several years to an entire decade has now been documented in patients, with observation ongoing. A hyperactive form of FIX improved efficacy in hemophilia B, and superior engineered variants of FVIII are emerging. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including pre-existing immunity to AAV capsids, toxicities, inter-patient variability in response to treatment, and difficulty in obtaining durable therapeutic expression of FVIII. In alternative approaches, in vivo gene editing and ex vivo gene therapies targeting hemopoietic cells are in development."

    "abstract": "One hemophilia treatment concept focuses on rebalancing coagulation and anticoagulation to restore normal blood clotting. Targeting the coagulation regulator, protein S (PS), in hemophilia shows promise to increase the generation of thrombin, a critical enzyme in the clotting process. This study aimed to: (1) assess whether inhibiting PS increases thrombin generation (TG) in plasma from individuals with hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB); and (2) develop a hepatocyte-targeted PS small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy using N-acetylgalactosamine conjugation to restore hemostasis in hemophilia without increasing thromboembolic risks. We assessed TG in plasma from patients with HA and HB. To target the liver specifically, we developed a PS-siRNA conjugated with N-acetylgalactosamine. This approach ensures that PS levels remain adequate in other cells, thereby minimizing the risk of thrombosis. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of PS-siRNA in preclinical models. Inhibiting PS with a polyclonal antibody in plasma resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in TG in HA and a 4- to 9-fold increase in HB plasma, with a 70% reduction in plasma PS. In preclinical models, subcutaneous PS-siRNA therapy in HA mice and nonhuman primates successfully lowered PS levels and improved clot formation. It also prevented bleeding in both saphenous vein puncture and knee injury models in HA mice. Notably, it enhanced clotting without triggering widespread clot formation. Reducing PS levels enhances TG in hemophilia models, and PS-siRNA therapy shows promise in improving hemostasis. This approach warrants further clinical investigation as a potential treatment for hemophilia."

Although exercise is beneficial, little is known about the clinical effects of programmes that focus on balance and proprioception in people with haemophilia (PwH). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-week multimodal balance and strength training programme (MBSTP) on balance, fall risk, strength, functionality, kinesiophobia and quality of life (QoL) in adult PwH. A single-blind non-randomized controlled trial was conducted with 22 PwH (mean age 34.5 ± 9.2 years). Participants were assigned to an experimental group (EG, n = 11), who underwent the MBSTP, or a control group (CG, n = 11), who continued their usual exercises. Static and dynamic, fall risk, strength and functionality (Time Up and Go, Sit to Stand Test and 2-Minute Walk Test), kinesiophobia and QoL were assessed pre- and post-intervention, Additionally, the participants' satisfaction with the programme was measured. Intervention effects were determined with a two-way mixed ANOVA. The EG presented significant improvements (p < 0.05, with a small to large effect size) in balance (bipodal open eyes in unstable surface and monopodal total-velocity, LoS and subjective perception of balance), functionality, fall risk and strength (quadriceps and gluteus medius) compared to the CG. The EG reported high satisfaction with the programme. Given the significant improvements in dynamic balance, lower limb strength, functionality and fall risk reduction, integrating supervised multimodal exercise programmes into routine rehabilitation for PwH could enhance mobility and prevent falls.

Hence, this study aimed to compare the SPP of PwH with healthy controls (CON), to differentiate them based on disease-specific, person-related, and arthropathy-related parameters, and to identify overarching determinants influencing SPP. SPP was assessed in 301 PwH and 263 CON via the HEP-Test-Q, which divides SPP into a total score and four distinct dimensions (e.g., mobility). Additionally, disease-specific (i.e., type, severity, treatment regime, HIV, hepatitis), person-related (i.e., age, BMI), and arthropathy-related parameters (i.e., current pain intensity (NRS-now) and average pain intensity across 4 weeks (NRS-4w) and the HJHS) were examined, and associations with SPP were calculated. All PwH and PwH subgroups demonstrated significantly greater impairment across all SPP dimensions compared to CON. Apart from the type of haemophilia (A vs. B, p = 0.894), significant differences in total SPP were observed among PwH subgroups for severity (severe vs. non-severe, p = 0.012), treatment (prophylaxis vs. on demand, p = 0.002), HIV (no vs. yes), and hepatitis (no vs. yes, both p < 0.001). A multiple linear regression model further revealed significant predictive effects for HJHS (p < 0.001) and NRS-4w (p < 0.001) on the total SPP score. PwH perceived their physical performance as significantly worse across all dimensions compared to CON. The decreased SPP in PwH can be attributed primarily to arthropathy-related factors, that is, an impaired joint status and persistent pain. To oppose the decline in SPP, tailored sports-therapeutic programs should be integrated into the multimodal treatment concept."

This study aimed to describe the profile of HA and HB patients, current disease management, clinical burden and costs. Data related to haemophilia patients of all ages alive on 1/1/2022 were extracted from the nationwide French claims database (SNDS). Patients were divided into four treatment groups: on-demand or prophylaxis with or without inhibitors. Haemophilia patients were compared with a control group (ratio 1:3) matched for age, gender and region using risk ratios (RR [95% confidence interval]). The annual direct health care costs per person were estimated. A total of 5,577 (HA) and 1,332 (HB) patients were included (mean age: 36.4 years). Most patients were treated on-demand (HA: 72.8%; HB: 76.6%) and a few had inhibitors (HA: 3.6%; HB: 1.1%). Overall, haemophilia clinical burden was significantly higher than among controls, in particular, mortality (RR:1.42 [1.04-1.92]), work disability (RR: 2.71 [2.22-3.30]), hospitalisation for major bleeding (RR:12.06 [8.67-16.80]), orthopaedic surgery (RR: 2.97 [2.65-3.32]) and hospitalisation all causes (RR: 2.44 [2.31-2.58]). This burden was more important in patients with inhibitors or treated in prophylaxis and was close for HA and HB patients. The annual per-person costs were €282,560 and €181,566 for HA and HB in prophylaxis without inhibitors, respectively. The population with inhibitors, although limited, had even much higher costs. The clinical burden and costs of haemophilia treatments may be very high especially in patients in prophylaxis and/or with inhibitors."

Splicing can be therefore modulated for therapeutic purposes, and splicing-switching molecules are in clinics for some diseases. Here, conscious that over 10% of all pathogenic mutations occurs at 5'ss, we aimed at characterizing and rescuing nine 5'ss mutations in three models of defective F8 exons whose skipping would lead to factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency (Hemophilia A), the most frequent coagulation factor disorder. HEK293T cells were transfected with F8 minigene variants, alone or with engineered U1 small nuclear RNAs (U1snRNAs), and splicing patterns analysed via RT-PCR. All 5'ss mutations induced exon skipping, and the proportion of correct transcripts, not predictable by computational analysis, was consistent with residual FVIII levels in patients. For each exon we identified a unique engineered U1snRNAs, either compensatory or Exon Specific (ExSpeU1), able to rescue all mutations. Overall, ExSpeU1s were more effective than compensatory U1snRNAs, particularly in the defective exons 6 and 22. Data highlight the importance of splicing assays to elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships and proved the correction efficacy of ExSpeU1s for each targeted defective F8 exon, thus expanding their translational potential for HA."

This study aims to evaluate the level of PA within the different haemophilia severity phenotypes and to elaborate on the interplay of PA in regard to bone quality (bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS)) as well as lean mass. This investigation was part of a large prospective single-center cohort study examining the relation between haemophilia and osteoporosis registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID: NCT04524481). PwH underwent a dual x-ray screening using Horizon™ to examine BMD, TBS, and lean mass. Step activity was tracked electronically for seven consecutive days after clinical examination, supported by a self-reported activity diary for seven days. Handgrip strength was examined as an overall fitness proxy. Data of 223 patients with either mild (N = 45), moderate (N = 46), or severe (N = 132) haemophilia A or B, aged 43.6 ± 15.6 years were analyzed. There was no significant difference in objective (p = 0.162) and subjective (p = 0.459) PA levels between severity phenotypes. The most frequent type of PA in all severities was walking (n = 72, 53.3%) and cycling (n = 60, 44.4%). Step activity positively correlated with TBS (rho = 0.202, p = 0.005) and lean mass positively correlated with BMD (rho = 0.309, p < 0.001). Handgrip strength correlated with BMD (rho = 0.361, p < 0.001) as well as TBS (rho = 0.221, p = 0.021) and lean mass (rho = 0.287, p = 0.003). PA does not differ significantly between the severity phenotypes. The majority of PwH in all severity phenotypes performed low-impact PA, which is most likely insufficient to positively affect BMD. However, handgrip strength correlates with BMD and TBS. Despite restrictions in movement function or reduced BMD, it is of major importance to promote PA to maintain a healthy or even increase bone quality."

    "title": "Mild or moderate hemophilia is not always a mild or moderate bleeding disorder: Back to the clinical phenotype.",
    "abstract": "In a previous paper, a comprehensive clinicopathologic approach to mild and moderate bleeding disorders (MBD) was proposed by an international working group (IWG) as a part of a project promoted by the European Hematology Association (EHA) on the development of guidelines on the various MBDs. A single pre-diagnosis grade 4 bleeding event according to the ISTH-BAT scale or a comparable event after diagnosis was considered sufficient to classify a patient as affected by a severe bleeding disorder (SBD). In this article, the original IWG integrated by experts and patients' representatives proposed by the European Haemophilia Consortium (EHC) and European Association of Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) applied these criteria to mild and moderate hemophilia A and B to establish the proportion of cases that would be reclassified as SBD taking into account bleeding phenotype, thus improving over the current classification based exclusively on basal factor VIII or IX level. To this aim, publications of unselected cases with bleeding history available from birth to the time of publication were considered to estimate the incidence of a first severe bleeding event. More than 20% of cases with mild or moderate hemophilia met the criteria for SBD by experiencing joint or non-joint severe bleeding events. Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients developed an inhibitor against factor VIII or IX. These results, based on a rigorous methodologic approach, substantiate the criticism of the current classification of hemophilia and argue for the adoption of a new classification that takes into account bleeding phenotype in addition to basal clotting activity."

    "abstract": "Acquired coagulopathy is uncommon. Cases of hemophilia A, which is characterized by reduced coagulation factor Ⅷ, have been reported but cases involving diminished factors VII, Ⅺ, or XII have not been reported. We report the case of a patient who presented with a chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH), which was challenging to treat due to underlying acquired coagulation abnormalities. Middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization is a promising approach for managing refractory CSDH and has proved effective in this case. An 82-year-old man with no significant medical history and family history presented with a headache and discomfort in his right lower extremity. A left CSDH was detected. Subsequent tests revealed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased activities of coagulation factors VII, Ⅺ, and XII. Emergency burr-hole irrigation was performed after administering recombinant coagulation factor VIIa. Two months later, the patient developed aphasia and recurrent hematoma. MMA embolization using N-butyl cyanoacrylate was performed to avoid recurrence, and burr-hole drainage reduced brain compression. The symptoms were relieved, and no recurrence was reported after discharge. This case description highlights a rare case of CSDH caused by the decreased activities of factors VII, XI, and XII. In addition, the efficacy of MMA embolization in patients with CSDH and limited coagulation disorder treatment options was demonstrated."

A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 10<sup>12</sup> CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 10<sup>12</sup> and 5.0 × 10<sup>13</sup> CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754."

    "abstract": "Inhibitor development against factor VIII (FVIII) is the most common complication of hemophilia A replacement therapy. One of the variables considered to influence inhibitor development is the ABO blood group. Patients with blood group O have, on average, a 30%-40% lower endogenous von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentration. It has been postulated that VWF levels influence inhibitor development. The objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitor risk in patients with severe hemophilia A comparing those with blood group O with those with non-O blood groups. The study population consisted of children with severe hemophilia A, born between 2000 and 2020, who reached 50 FVIII exposure days in the PedNet registry. Inhibitors were considered to be clinically relevant when at least two consecutive measurements were tested positive. Routine testing of blood groups varied between centres: Out of 1172 patients with severe hemophilia A, blood group status was known in 759 patients (65.8%). The relative risk of inhibitor development for blood group O in comparison to non-O was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.7-1.7). In the PedNet cohort, blood group O did not increase the risk of inhibitors in previously untreated children with severe hemophilia A. PedNet Registry; clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02979119."

    "title": "Acute Compartment Syndrome in Congenital and Acquired Haemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a surgical emergency defined as an increase in intramuscular pressure within a compartment that compromises capillary perfusion and threatens the survival of compartment tissues. A sustained increase in compartment pressure causes irreversible necrosis of nerves and muscles, leading to permanent damage. To conduct a narrative review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of ACS in persons with congenital and acquired haemophilia (PwH) METHODS: An English-language literature search for articles published before 28 February 2024 was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE) and the Cochrane Library using \"haemophilia and compartment syndrome\" as keywords. We found 77 articles in PubMed (of which 19 were eliminated as not strictly related to the topic) and 1 in the Cochrane Library (which was repeated in PubMed). In total, there are 83 published cases (61 of congenital haemophilia and 22 of acquired haemophilia). Misdiagnosis or failure to perform early haematological treatment in PwH suffering from ACS, followed by extensive fasciotomy if haematological treatment does not stop the problem, may result in permanent disability of the affected limb. The prognosis will depend on the intensity and duration of the compartment pressure elevation. For PwH, adequate clotting factor replacement should be the first step of treatment, as it may be effective in some cases of ACS. In general, factor levels of 50%-100% should be maintained in the perioperative period; thereafter, the dose can be gradually reduced to maintain levels at 50% for approximately 2 weeks or longer if necessary."

This article presents population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) of efanesoctocog alfa and repeated time-to-event (RTTE) analysis of bleeding episodes in adults/adolescents (≥12 years of age) and children (<12 years). The final PopPK dataset contained pooled data from 277 patients (4405 post-dose factor VIII [FVIII] activity records) from two Phase 1/2a studies (NCT03205163; EudraCT 2018-001535-51), and three Phase 3 studies, XTEND-1 (NCT04161495), XTEND-Kids (NCT04759131), and XTEND-ed (NCT04644575). The PopPK model developed was a linear one-compartment model including body weight effect on clearance and volume of central compartment; Asian race was identified as a statistically significant covariate on clearance. The final PopPK model adequately described the FVIII activity-time profiles in adults, adolescents, and children with once-weekly (QW) efanesoctocog alfa 50 IU/kg, consistent with experience in XTEND-1 and XTEND-Kids. Bleeding episodes in participants in XTEND-1 and XTEND-Kids were characterized by an RTTE model with a Weibull base hazard and effect of FVIII activity modeled by a power effect. The RTTE model showed the probability of being bleed-free in 1 year with efanesoctocog alfa 50 IU/kg QW regimen was >70% across all age groups, consistent with the observed clinical outcomes in the Phase 3 trials of highly effective protection from bleeding episodes in patients with severe hemophilia A, which validates the model's prediction of the long-term bleed hazard."

    "abstract": "Dense sampling served as the foundation for the conventional calculation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Individual PK can now be estimated via sparse sampling thanks to the development of Bayesian population PK (popPK). Both My Precise Dose (MPD) and the Web-Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service-Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo) use the popPK model of BAY 81-8973 to forecast personalized dosage. To compare the PK profiles and dosage estimates provided by WAPPS-Hemo and MPD for prophylaxis in children with hemophilia A treated with BAY 81-8973. Thirty-eight pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A were enrolled. After a 72-h washout period, each patient received a 50 IU/kg infusion of BAY 81-8973. PK parameters were calculated at three time points: pre-dose, 3 h, and 24 h after infusion. Dosing regimens to maintain FVIII trough levels at 1 and 3 IU/dL were determined using the WAPPS-Hemo and MPD models, respectively. Among the 38 pediatric patients with a median age of 5.7 years (range: 2.8-11.2 years), the MPD exhibited superior values for the half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC) in comparison to the WAPPS-Hemo, while demonstrating reduced clearance (CL) and steady-state volume of distribution (VSS). WAPPS-Hemo made more mistakes when predicting FVIII activity at 48 h (28.84 %) and 72 h (50.19 %), but only 12.45 % and 47.44 % of the time when predicting by MPD. Statistical analysis indicated a significant difference between the two techniques regarding individual dosage at both 1 IU/dL and 3 IU/dL. [(1 IU/dL: WAPPS-Hemo 12.1 (9.3, 17.1) vs. MPD 7.3 (5.5, 9.9), P < 0.001; 3 IU/dL: WAPPS-Hemo 36.3 (27.8, 51.3) vs. MPD 21.9 (16.4, 30.0), P < 0.001).].

A significant, notable increase of FVIII levels were observed for FVIII biosimilars. Further investigation into the effect of rFVII biosimilars on inhibitor-positive patients revealed a significant alteration in PT (<i>P</i> < .0001) and aPTT (<i>P</i> < .001) values.ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the effect of all four drugs on PT, aPTT, FVIII, and FVII. Two different groups of biosimilars were found to have a high potential to alter the PT and aPTT values. The FVIII biosimilars are efficient in increasing the FVIII levels."

A retrospective analysis was performed on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and TEG testing results of 17 children with severe HA before and after EMI treatment at Shenzhen Children's Hospital from January 2023 to July 2024. Correlation analysis was conducted between coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) equivalent activity and reaction time (R value) measured by TEG. After EMI treatment, the mean bleeding rate for children with severe HA was 1.6 events per year, with 15 children (88%) without spontaneous bleeding or joint bleeding. The children with severe HA showed a significant reduction in APTT after EMI treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), with a significantly shorter APTT than the normal control group (<i>P</i><0.05). There was no correlation between APTT and FVIII equivalent activity after treatment (<i>P</i>>0.05). After EMI treatment, TEG parameters, including R value, kinetic time, alpha angle (α), maximum amplitude, clot strength, and coagulation index, shifted from a hypocoagulable state before treatment to a nearly normal state after treatment (<i>P</i><0.05). The R value demonstrated a strong negative correlation with FVIII equivalent activity (<i>r</i>=-0.758, <i>P</i><0.05). The bleeding condition of children with severe HA can be effectively controlled after EMI treatment. Routine APTT testing cannot reflect true coagulation function, whereas TEG testing is clinically valuable in assessing the coagulation function of children with severe HA undergoing EMI treatment."

To analyse the prevalence of comorbidities and mortality in people with haemophilia (PwH) compared to matched controls in subgroups (factor consumption and sex). This study used longitudinal individual-level data (11 years) from national registers in three Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) from the MIND study (NCT03276130) for PwH and matched controls (1:5 on birth year and sex). It compared the prevalence of arthropathy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, depression, anxiety, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease and epilepsy, and mortality. Three severity subgroups for PwH were identified by use of factor concentrates and sex, including female carriers. Data for 2716 PwH (24,921 person-years) were analysed. PwH had increased prevalence of single and multiple comorbidities (p < 0.001), and increased mortality (p < 0.001). Arthropathy was more prevalent in all male PwH subgroups in Nordic countries, and among women including carriers in Sweden (odds ratios: ∼2→12). Arthropathy was a concomitant comorbidity alongside depression, hypertension, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, hepatitis and HIV. Hypertension was more prevalent for PwH than controls in most subgroups. Hepatitis and HIV had the highest odds ratios among PwH in Denmark and Sweden. Arthropathy occurs in combination with a complex of comorbidities. The potential common pathophysiologic denominator should be further explored. Higher prevalence of comorbidities and mortality rates in men and women with haemophilia call for a holistic approach with more ambitious treatment goals for PwH across severities and sexes.

This study reviews a single-center cohort to evaluate patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively reviewed the records of 22 adult patients diagnosed with AHA between 2012 and 2024. The data included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatments, and outcomes. Statistical analysis compared genders and evaluated treatment strategies and remission outcomes. <b>Results:</b> The cohort had an equal gender distribution with an average age of 62 years (22-102 years). Suspected etiologies included pregnancy (27%), malignancy (23%), autoimmune diseases (5%), and idiopathic causes (45%). The most common presentation was spontaneous cutaneous hematoma (82%). Severe bleeding necessitating hemostatic therapy occurred in 9% of cases. Initial immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with corticosteroids achieved remission in 45% of patients, while additional treatment with Rituximab or Cyclophosphamide was required in others. Emicizumab, a novel FVIII-mimetic, was successfully used in one patient with severe refractory bleeding. Remission was achieved in 64% of patients within a median of 3 months, with a recurrence rate of 14%. No thrombotic events were observed, although corticosteroid side effects, including one hip fracture, were noted. <b>Conclusions:</b> IST remains the cornerstone of AHA treatment, though side effects necessitate individualized care. Emicizumab shows promise, particularly in refractory cases and fragile populations. Future research is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes and spontaneous remission rates, especially in special populations like post-partum women and the elderly."

The underlying pathomechanisms of BP-AHA remain elusive. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 196 BP patients admitted to our hospital. We have collected serum samples from a recently admitted BP-AHA patient and healthy controls to isolate, screen and identify the potential FVIII inhibitors. The expression and function of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) in BP-AHA were further validated by a series of biochemical experiments. The retrospective analysis showed that the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values of seven patients exceeded 33.8 s (normal value) in 196 BP patients. FVIII: C (%) and FVIII inhibitors in the plasma of partial prolonged-APTT patients were significantly altered compared with control group or non-prolonged-APTT group. LBP was identified as a potential inhibitory protein of FVIII. Consistently, a notable alteration in LBP expression was observed in the plasma of BP patients with prolonged-APTT. Moreover, the amount of LBP bound to FVIII in the BP-AHA patient was notably higher than that in control group, which was also markedly reversed after treatment. In vitro experiments finally confirmed that exogenous LBP directly bound to FVIII and significantly inhibited FVIII activity. In conclusion, the incidence of AHA in BP patients may be substantially underestimated, which needs more vigilance towards indicators such as APTT, LBP, and FVIII. LBP emerges as an inhibitory protein of FVIII, indicating the potential involvement in the progression of BP-AHA."

    "title": "A literature review of major surgery experience with emicizumab in people with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "People with hemophilia A have a total or partial deficiency of factor (F)VIII, causing spontaneous and/or traumatic bleeding into the joints, muscles, and soft tissues. Major surgery may be required to restore joint mobility or treat the symptoms of common comorbidities in people with hemophilia A. Additional factor replacement is recommended during the perioperative period; collated information on the experience of emicizumab-treated people with hemophilia A during major surgery is currently lacking. To provide a consolidated narrative summary of the experience with emicizumab in people with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors undergoing major surgery, a comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE (cut-off date: March 31, 2024); the abstract books for applicable congresses (2016-2024) were searched manually. Studies were included if reporting original data on people with hemophilia A of all ages and hemophilia A severities without FVIII inhibitors on emicizumab prophylaxis who had undergone major surgery. Outcomes collected included perioperative surgical management, adverse events, and bleeding events. Twenty publications were included; 72 procedures were reported. Twenty-two orthopedic and 34 other major procedures were specifically described. FVIII replacement was used to manage 66 procedures perioperatively, and 25 procedures were managed in conjunction with antifibrinolytics. Fifteen procedures resulted in a bleeding event, and one individual experienced a thrombotic event. No deaths were reported. This review provides a consolidated narrative of the currently reported experiences of emicizumab-treated people with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors undergoing major surgery, helping to support the future management decisions of emicizumab-treated people with hemophilia A during surgery."

    "abstract": "Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is the only factor VIII (FVIII) gene therapy currently approved for adults with severe hemophilia A in Europe and the USA. Elevated alanine transaminase (transaminitis) has been the most common adverse event observed during valoctocogene roxaparvovec clinical trials. Typically mild and transient, this marker of hepatocyte injury coincides, in some patients, with reduced FVIII levels and is generally managed with a reactive course of corticosteroids. An essential step in optimizing outcomes for patients who receive valoctocogene roxaparvovec is reviewing the extensive evidence currently available on this topic to determine practices for managing transaminitis, if it occurs. This forum article provides practical guidance based on the available clinical data and expert opinion for evaluating and managing transaminitis with corticosteroids to mitigate potential declines in FVIII activity levels in adults with severe hemophilia A who have received valoctocogene roxaparvovec."

    "abstract": "The concept of restoring hemostasis by down-tuning anticoagulant pathways holds the promise of treating all forms of hemophilia. Here, we report preclinical efficacy and safety data for SerpinPC, a covalent inhibitor of activated protein C (APC). APC is a serine protease that degrades the enzyme complex that produces thrombin, and its inhibition allows for more thrombin to be produced during the initiation stage of hemostasis. In a hemophilia A (HA) mouse tail clip model, SerpinPC treatment reduced blood loss in a dose- and time-dependent manner to levels comparable with wild-type (WT) mice. SerpinPC was able to treat active bleeds in HA mice and prevented spontaneous internal bleeding when given prophylactically. SerpinPC treatment was not associated with an increased inflammatory response and was well tolerated at high doses in WT animals. SerpinPC is currently being evaluated in individuals with severe hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII, F8) result in the bleeding disorder hemophilia A. An emerging novel therapeutic strategy for bleeding disorders is to enhance hemostasis by limiting natural anticoagulants, such as antithrombin (AT3). To study pro/anticoagulant hemostatic balance in an in vivo model, we used genome editing to create null alleles for f8 and von Willebrand factor (vwf) in zebrafish, a model organism with a high degree of homology to the mammalian hemostatic system and unique attributes, including external development and optical transparency. f8 homozygous mutant larvae surprisingly formed normal thrombi when subjected to laser-mediated endothelial injury, had no overt signs of hemorrhage, although did have a modest increase in mortality. We have previously shown that at3-/- larvae develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with spontaneous thrombosis and fibrinogen consumption, resulting in a bleeding phenotype marked by secondary lack of induced thrombus formation upon endothelial injury. We found that with loss of FVIII (f8-/-;at3-/-), larvae no longer developed spontaneous fibrin thrombi and did produce clots in response to endothelial injury. In contrast, homozygous loss of zebrafish Vwf failed to rescue the at3 DIC phenotype. These findings demonstrate an altered balance of natural anticoagulants that mitigates FVIII deficiency in zebrafish, similar to hemostatic drugs in the clinical development pipeline, and suggest that zebrafish FVIII might circulate independently of Vwf. Further exploration of this unique balance in zebrafish could provide novel insights for the treatment of hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease."

    "title": "Contemporary approaches to treat people with hemophilia: what's new and what's not?",
    "abstract": "The care of people with hemophilia with access to treatment has evolved over the past 70 years, with an average life expectancy like unaffected peers. For people with hemophilia living in low- and middle-income countries, the same is not true because of the lack of access to diagnosis and treatment. It is imperative to close gaps in care that exist throughout the world. Here, we provide a narrative review of hemophilia and the treatments available to people with hemophilia A and B with the goal of achieving a hemophilia-free state. We aim to provide information on what is new and what gaps remain that preclude equitable outcomes for everyone with hemophilia. Information on the current state of hemophilia care and outcomes, the products available for the treatment of people with hemophilia, comprehensive interdisciplinary care of people with hemophilia, and the remaining gaps in care for people with hemophilia were assembled by the authors using relevant literature. Research must focus on preventing all bleeding, and new approaches to detect joint bleeding are needed. Training on and implementation of comprehensive interdisciplinary care is needed to elevate the standards of care in low- and middle-income countries. The development and introduction of improved factor replacement and nonfactor products, such as second-generation bispecific monoclonal antibodies and targeted inhibitors of the anticoagulant mechanisms along with genetic therapies, have the possibility of normalizing hemostasis and achieving health equity for people with hemophilia. Improved outcomes and, ultimately, health equity, can only be realized if diagnosis, education, and care are accessible to everyone living with hemophilia worldwide."

This study aims to identify the characteristics of patients experiencing vascular injuries postvaccination and to outline key clinical considerations. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed/MEDLINE databases was performed for English-language publications up to July 2024. Eligible studies included reports of vascular injuries following COVID-19 vaccination. Of the 1064 articles retrieved, 35 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of cases presented symptoms after receiving the first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen vaccines. Diagnosed conditions included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), vasculitis, and acquired hemophilia A. None of the patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of diagnosis. The most commonly affected sites were the lower extremities, with petechiae, purpura, and ecchymosis being the predominant manifestations. Our findings suggest a possible but unconfirmed association between COVID-19 vaccination and the development of vascular injuries, including petechiae, purpura, and ecchymosis. These symptoms may serve as early indicators of critical conditions requiring urgent medical intervention. Further research and postvaccination monitoring are necessary to establish causality and assess potential risk factors."

Hemophilia-related complications caused by bleeding into the joints (the hallmark of hemophilia) and age-related comorbidities occur frequently and impact the functionality and quality of life of persons with hemophilia (PwH). Given the chronic nature of hemophilia, we hypothesized that hemophilia has an association with accelerated biological aging. Therefore, we investigated biological aging biomarkers, i.e. telomere length and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number with a quantitative-PCR-based assay in PwH (n=99) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=61). The association of telomere length and mtDNA copy number with hemophilia severity was investigated using ordinary-least-squares linear regression models allowing for interactions with chronological age.

    "abstract": "Patients with severe hemophilia A (HA) often develop undesired immune responses to therapeutic factor VIII (FVIII) that hamper replacement therapy with FVIII-derived products. The transplacental delivery of two Fc-fused FVIII domains in pregnant HA mice was shown to induce partial FVIII-specific immune tolerance in the offspring. Here, we evaluated whether the transplacental delivery of Fc-fused FVIII (rFVIIIFc) induces complete immune tolerance towards FVIII. rFVIIIFc injected to pregnant HA mice was poorly transferred to the fetal circulation and failed to confer tolerance to exogenous FVIII in the offspring. The poor transplacental delivery of rFVIIIFc was associated with the large size of the molecule and with the presence of positive patches at the surface of FVIII. It was however independent from the capacity of rFVIIIFc to bind Fcô€€€ receptor or von Willebrand factor in the maternal circulation. Conversely, the transplacental delivery of Fc-fused A2 and C2 immunodominant domains of FVIII, as well as of Fc-fused molecules containing seven different immunodominant FVIII-derived peptides decreased the levels of anti-FVIII antibodies following FVIII replacement therapy in the offspring. Our study paves the way towards the development of engineered Fc-fused molecules able to efficiently cross the placenta and confer potent and long-lasting immune tolerance to protein therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Hemophilic arthropathy (HA) is a complication of hemophilia, which is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in blood clotting factors. HA is characterized by joint damage with inflammatory responses, pain, and movement limitations due to recurrent bleeding in the joints. The inflammatory reactions contribute to the activation of coagulation factors, which can exacerbate bleeding and further damage the affected joints. Therefore, the interaction between inflammation and coagulation plays a crucial role in the progression and complications of HA. Management strategies often focus both on inflammation and coagulation to alleviate symptoms and preserve joint function. Temperature can influence the inflammatory response and coagulation. The aim of this work was to understand how temperature management can positively or negatively influence the HA. We have carried out a narrative review of the available literature. This review explores the impacts of temperature on biological processes, and it discusses the possible clinical implications for the HA treatment. Our research shows that cold exposure has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, while heat is linked to pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Both hot and cold treatments are ill-advised for hemophilia patients. Heat stimulates neo-angiogenesis, and cold hampers coagulation, posing risks for increased bleeding in individuals with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Factor VIII (FVIII) is involved in several molecular pathways and biological processes; indeed, it has a role in the coagulative cascade, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, brain and renal function, cancer incidence and spread, macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis. Hemophilic patients usually present an increase in fracture risk, bone resorption, and an excess of osteoporosis as compared to healthy individuals. Several studies have tried to clarify their etiology but unfortunately it is still unclear. This review focuses on the role of FVIII in bone biology by summarizing all the knowledge present in the literature. We carried out a systematic review of the available literature following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Several studies demonstrated that FVIII is involved in different molecular pathways interfering with bone physiology; it exerts interesting effects on OPG/RANK/RANKL pathways and thrombin/PAR1 pathways. These data confirm a relationship between FVIII and bone metabolism; however, there are still many aspects to be clarified. This review highlights the role of the coagulation factor FVIII in bone metabolism, suggesting new hypotheses for future studies both in vitro and in vivo to better understand the important pleiotropic role of FVIII and hopefully to develop new therapeutic agents for skeletal diseases."

    "title": "Could PTH/Ca Ratio Serve as a New Marker for Evaluating Bone Metabolism in Hemophilia Patients?",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in hemophilia patients. Identifying high-risk patients for low BMD early is essential to prevent complications and reduce morbidity. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)/calcium (Ca) ratio is a cost-effective marker for predicting BMD, highlighting the need for routine screening and early intervention in this population. Hemophilia is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (hemophilia A) and IX (hemophilia B). Patients with hemophilia are at risk of low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD, associated risk factors, and raise awareness regarding its significance in hemophilia patients. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively assessed bone metabolism in 62 hemophilia patients followed at our center. BMD was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Additionally, serum levels of 25-OH-D3, alkaline phosphatase, PTH, Ca, phosphor, and creatinine were measured. The PTH/Ca, PTH/25-OH-D3, and Ca×25-OH-D3/PTH ratios were calculated. <b>Results:</b> The median age of the 62 patients with hemophilia included in the study (hemophilia A: 87.1%, hemophilia B: 12.9%) was 37 years (range: 21-66), and all were male. Of these patients, 67.7% (<i>n</i> = 42) had severe, 21% (<i>n</i> = 13) had moderate, and 11.3% (<i>n</i> = 7) had mild hemophilia. A total of 85.5% of patients were on factor prophylaxis, and 75.4% had a target joint. In laboratory analysis, the median 25-OH-D3 level was 13.4 µg/L and 75% patients had 25-OH-D3 deficiency. According to DEXA results, 62.9% had lower than normal BMD. When we divided the patients into normal and low BMD groups according to DEXA results, weight (<i>p</i> = 0.006), height (<i>p</i> = 0.024), factor levels (<i>p</i> = 0.004), PTH (<i>p</i> = 0.010), AST (<i>p</i> = 0.029), and PTH/Ca (<i>p</i> = 0.011) levels were statistically significantly different between the groups. The severity of the disease and the rate of receiving prophylaxis were higher in the group with low BMD (<i>p</i> = 0.015, <i>p</i> = 0.006, respectively). In multivariate analysis, PTH/Ca ratio and weight were found to be independent risk factors for BMD. A linear relationship was found between PTH/Ca ratio and BMD. The optimal cut-off value for PTH/Ca was 6.57, with a selectivity of 65% and specificity of 82%. When we divided the patients into groups according to the cut-off value of 6.57, we found that the probability of low BMD increased approximately 7-fold in the group with PTH/Ca > 6.57 (OR 7.045, 95% CI 1.485-33.42, <i>p</i> = 0.014). There was an inverse association between patient weight and low BMD (<i>p</i> = 0.043). <b>Conclusions:</b> Low BMD is a critical public health concern frequently observed in patients with hemophilia. The study highlights a high rate of low BMD and 25-OH-D3 deficiency in hemophilia patients, with the PTH/Ca ratio shown to be useful in predicting BMD. The PTH/Ca ratio is suggested as an accessible, cost-effective, and practical test for evaluating BMD in hemophilia patients."

    "abstract": "Current research on osteoporosis (OP) in hemophilia is insufficient. The suitability of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) for evaluating osteoporosis in hemophilia remains unclear. To investigate the current status of osteoporosis and the applicability of HR-pQCT in adult hemophilia patients. Thirty three hemophilia patients aged 23-49 years were recruited. X-ray examinations were performed on the bleeding joints. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and HR-pQCT were used to assess bone mineral density (BMD). The HR-pQCT values of the distal tibia and radius were compared between hemophilia patients and healthy controls(HCs). All bleeding joints showed local osteoporosis on X-ray. Only 33.3% of patients had a hip BMD lower than the expected value according to DXA.

Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation (r = 0.768, p = 0.016) between femoral neck BMD with DXA and total volumetric BMD(Tt.vBMD) at the distal tibia. The bone health status of adult hemophilia patients in China is worrying. The occurrence of OP may be accompanied by varying degrees of bone loss, bone destruction, and structural abnormalities observed in both trabecular and cortical bones of the upper and lower limbs. The condition of the trabecular bones in the lower limbs is particularly severe. The correlation between BMD measurements obtained from HR-pQCT and DXA is strong."

    "title": "Predicting the effects of single pathological mutations in hemophilia A and type 2N von Willebrand diseases using AlphaFold2-multimer and AlphaFold3.",
    "abstract": "Most factor VIII (FVIII) in circulation exists in a complex with von Willebrand factor (vWF). The interaction between FVIII and vWF is vital for normal hemostatic function, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia. However, the impact of pathological mutations on the binding between FVIII and vWF remains largely uncharacterized. In the current study, we used AlphaFold2-multimer and AlphaFold3 to predict the complex involving FVIII and vWF. Additionally, we explored how known mutations in FVIII or vWF, which can result in mild to severe forms of hemophilia and type 2N von Willebrand disease, affect this complex. Our predictions confirm that AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 can accurately model the FVIII/vWF complex in a manner consistent with existing cryogenic electron microscopy structures. However, the single pathological mutations can generally disrupt the complex interface predicted by AlphaFold2-multimer but not AlphaFold3. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that the flexibility of several common regions was affected by single pathological mutations. We further designed a new FVIII construct using AlphaFold2, which holds promise as a more effective therapeutic agent with reduced autoimmune responses. In summary, our findings suggest that in combination with molecular dynamics, AlphaFold2 is a valuable tool for swiftly assessing the impact of both known and novel mutations on hemophilia, with potential applications in precision medicine and the development of novel therapeutic interventions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study provides novel insights into the protein structure of the factor VIII and von Willebrand factor complex. This research demonstrates that AlphaFold2-multimer rather than AlphaFold3 can better predict the variations in the complex corresponding to clinical observations of disease severity. These findings not only deepen our comprehension of hemostatic mechanisms but also establish AlphaFold2 in combination with molecular dynamics as a useful tool for hemophilia research, with potential applications in precision medicine and the development of novel therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "For every man diagnosed with hemophilia, approximately 1.6 women are expected to be carriers. Carriers are classified based on their factor (F) VIII levels and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to mild, either moderate or severe symptoms. Close monitoring is critical for carriers with low FVIII levels or bleeding symptoms, as the bleeding risk is difficult to assess due to inconsistent correlations with routine one-step assay (OSA) measurements. This study hypothesized that the chromogenic FVIII assay (CSA) may provide valuable information for estimating the bleeding risk in some hemophilia carriers. This retrospective study included 109 hemophilia A carriers from 2 centers. Among them, 23% had FVIII levels <40 IU/dL when assessed using OSA, while 41% showed discrepancies when assessed using CSA. von Willebrand factor activity and antigen levels were normal, with mean values of 84 IU/dL and 107, respectively. There was a significant correlation between OSA and CSA FVIII results, although 20 women had discordant results between the 2 methods. Bleeding events were reported in 49 women, including 18 surgical complications, 1 joint bleeding episode, and 30 cases of heavy menstrual bleeding, all occurring with normal von Willebrand factor levels. There were 157 pregnancies in which 14 cases of postpartum hemorrhage were observed, 3 of which required transfusion or surgery. This study highlights the significant discrepancies between OSA and CSA in FVIII results, with implications for diagnosis and bleeding risk assessment. It emphasizes the need to use both methods to identify women at a higher risk of bleeding, especially before surgery."

Inhibitor formation critically depends on T cell help and modulation by regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this study, we evaluated the F5111 immunocytokine (IC), a single-chain fusion between the human interleukin (IL)-2 cytokine and an IL-2 antibody that biases cytokine activity toward cells with high IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)α expression, leading to extended IL-2 half-life and selective expansion of Tregs. A transient F5111 IC administration regimen was applied to a hemophilia A murine model of FVIII replacement therapy. Inhibitory antibody development to FVIII was monitored longitudinally by Bethesda assay and ELISA. F5111 IC failed to stimulate cell types that predominantly express the dimeric IL2Rβγ receptor complex such as effector T and natural killer cells. Potent and highly transient Treg expansion was associated with suppression of effector T cells and in vivo conversion into Tregs. When tested in the hemophilia A mouse model, F5111 IC completely prevented the formation of inhibitors against FVIII for up to 4 months, long after Treg numbers returned to baseline levels. These results demonstrate that F5111 IC induces a superior and prolonged tolerogenic response compared with an unbiased control IC. Overall, this study presents a novel and effective strategy for preventing inhibitory antibodies that hinder the effectiveness of FVIII replacement therapy in hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "While the conventional understanding of haemostatic plug formation is that coagulation proceeds efficiently on the surface of activated platelets at the vascular injury site to form a robust haemostatic plug, this understanding does not explain the clinical reality that platelet dysfunction results in a mild bleeding phenotype, whereas coagulation disorders exhibit severe bleeding phenotypes, particularly in deep tissues. Here, we introduce an in vivo imaging method to observe internal bleeding and subsequent haemostatic plug formation in mice and report that haemostatic plug formation after internal bleeding, coagulation occurs primarily outside the blood vessel rather than on platelets. Experiments in mice with impaired platelet surface coagulation, depleted platelets, haemophilia A or reduced tissue factor expression suggest that this extravascular coagulation triggers and regulates haemostatic plug formation. Our discovery of the important role of extravascular coagulation in haemostasis may contribute to refining the treatment of haemostatic abnormalities and advancing antithrombotic therapy."

This phase 3 open-label extension study (ATLAS-OLE) evaluated safety and efficacy of an AT-based dose regimen (AT-DR) in males aged ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A/B, with/without inhibitors. The original dose regimen (ODR) of 80 mg monthly was optimized to AT-DR targeting AT activity levels 15% to 35% to mitigate thrombotic risk (starting dose of 50 mg once every 2 months, individually adjusted to 20 mg once every 2 months, or 20/50/80 mg monthly as needed). Primary and secondary end points were safety and efficacy, respectively. Integrated safety analyses assessed safety of AT-DR and ODR across all fitusiran studies and integrated efficacy analyses compared efficacy of AT-DR in ATLAS-OLE with phase 3 parent study control groups. At interim data cutoff, 213 participants were enrolled on AT-DR (78% on regimens of once every 2 months). Integrated safety analyses of participants receiving AT-DR (n = 286) demonstrated that AT-DR was well tolerated. In ATLAS-OLE, median observed annualized bleeding rate (ABR) with AT-DR was 3.7 (interquartile range, 0.0-7.5). Integrated efficacy analyses demonstrated superiority of AT-DR over on-demand clotting factor concentrates (CFCs; 71% mean ABR reduction; P < .0001), and on-demand bypassing agents (BPAs; 73% mean ABR reduction; P = .0006); improvement over BPA prophylaxis (70% mean ABR reduction); and ABR comparable with that observed with CFC prophylaxis.

Genetic testing is necessary to determine carrier status in those at risk and early identification of carriers can inform their bleeding risk. The aims of this single-center retrospective study were to determine the uptake of genetic testing in children at risk to be hemophilia carriers and identify barriers to completion of testing. We identified 64 unique at-risk children assigned female sex at birth under 18 years old, with at least one caregiver participating in a visit between June 2019 and July 2023 with a genetic counselor with expertise in hemophilia. Of all those at risk, 27% (17/64) had undergone genetic testing prior to having genetic counseling at our center, at a median age of 5 years. Of those who had not yet had genetic testing (47/64): insurance prior authorization was initiated for 49% (23/47), testing was completed for 28% (13/47) at a median age of 11 years, and factor activity levels were known or drawn after the visit for 36% (17/47). The primary reason (14/24, 58%) for not initiating insurance prior authorization was not having a known family variant. Because carrier testing for X-linked disorders standardly involves targeted family variant testing rather than full gene testing, increasing the accessibility of carrier testing depends on increasing the accessibility and uptake of genetic testing in affected family members, usually individuals assigned male sex at birth, with a diagnosis of hemophilia. The impact of the decision to pursue genetic testing on current or future family members at risk to be carriers could be included in counseling discussions with individuals with hemophilia and their families."

We evaluated retrospectively 15 postpartum AHA cases between 2007 and 2023 in order to evaluate response in terms of inhibitor eradication. The median age at diagnosis was 31 years (range 24-38). All patients reported bleeding at presentation after a median period of 40.6 days following delivery (range 2-180 days). The median FVIII level was 4.4% (range 0%-12.8%), with a median FVIII-inhibitor titer of 35 BU (range 2-156). The most severe bleeding symptoms were metrorrhagia and genital bleeding in nine patients (60%), and one patient had an important muscular haematoma. Two patients underwent hysterectomy before diagnosis due to severe bleeding. All patients required anti-haemorrhagic therapy with a median duration of 8 days (range 1-28 days): 60% (9/15) with eptacog alfa, two with an activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and in combination in four cases. The immunosuppressive treatment was corticosteroids alone in eight patients (53%), cyclophosphamide or azathioprine in combination with corticosteroids in four, while rituximab was used in two cases following traditional immunosuppressive therapy. After a median period of 28 days (range 10-210 days), the anti-FVIII inhibitor was eradicated with normalisation of coagulation in all but one patient. However, immunosuppressive therapy, including tapering, had a median duration of 2.3 months (range 1-23 months). At the time of data censoring, all patients were alive and well at the last follow-up with no significant adverse events. Notwithstanding that postpartum AHA has been reported to have a high rate of spontaneous remission, nearly half of this series experienced inhibitor eradication more than 1 month after disease onset and using immunosuppressive treatment for more than 2 months, with additional drugs being used in more than 40% of them, thus showing difficulties in disease remission in this postpartum AHA subpopulation."

    "abstract": "Laboratory reagents impact measured factor activity of extended half-life (EHL) concentrates. Variability in measurements may lead to under or over estimation of the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and thus influence clinical dosing decisions. Since 2020, WAPPS-Hemo (www.wapps-hemo.org) has been collecting reagent information when haemophilia centres submit data for PK parameters estimation. To identify the pairs of concentrates (recombinant FVIII and FIX) and reagents leading to significant discrepancies between observed PK estimates compared to WAPPS-Hemo population. PK data were extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database. PK estimates were obtained using WAPPS-Hemo Bayesian engine and analysis was reported for terminal half-life and time to 3% following a 50 IU/kg infusion. Log-deviations between individual PK estimates and WAPPS-Hemo population PK models typical values were calculated to remove known sources of variability. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) regression was performed to assess the reagent effects. A total of 3853 and 1312 PK estimates were used to analyse reagent effects on the four FVIII and three FIX EHL concentrates, respectively. The reagent was not provided for 2391 PK estimates (46.3%). WFH unadvised reagents were provided for 78 PK estimates only (2.8% of known reagents). For each concentrate/reagent pair recommended by WFH, no significant difference was identified, except for rFIX-Fc whose PK parameters were significantly and clinically under-estimated by STA PTT-A. Real-world data provided by haemophilia centres showed high congruence with WFH guidelines, although its sizable number not declaring reagent. WFH-recommended reagents did not significantly impact PK estimation. For rFVIII-PEG, reagents also did not impact PK estimation. Although usually not enough data were available to assess reagents that were unadvised by WFH."

    "abstract": "Despite reports of elevated rates of osteoporosis and fractures in persons with haemophilia (PwH) and von Willebrand disease (PwVWD), routine bone health screening using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans is not consistently implemented for this population across all Haemophilia Treatment Centres (HTCs) in the United States. The primary aim of this study was to examine rates of screening for bone health in PwH and PwVWD with vitamin D levels and DEXA scans. We conducted a survey of all federally funded HTCs nationwide from June 2023 to August 2023. Nine multiple-choice questions were developed to explore the roles of HTC providers and their current practices for bone health assessment. The survey achieved a response rate of 44.8% (66 out of 147 HTCs). Among the responding centres, 21 HTCs (31.8%) reported routinely screening for vitamin D deficiency during annual comprehensive visits, while 13.6% (n = 9) performed regular bone health screenings using DEXA scans. Of these nine centres, three were adult HTCs and six were lifespan HTCs. DEXA scans were ordered either by physicians at the HTC (n = 5, 55.5%) or patients were referred to primary care providers, endocrinologists, or other specialists (n = 4, 44.4%). The top three indications for DEXA scans among the responding HTCs included HIV (n = 7, 77.7%), low physical activity or immobility (n = 6, 66.7%), fractures after a minor fall or injury in patients under 50 years of age (n = 5, 55.5%) and vitamin D deficiency (n = 5, 55.5%). These findings underscore the need for specific standardized screening guidelines to optimize bone health screening in PwH and PwVWD."

    "abstract": "Inhibitor development is a primary concern for pediatric patients with hemophilia A (HA) undergoing recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) therapy, yet relevant research is lacking. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of standard (SHL) and extended half-life (EHL) rFVIII products in previously treated (PTPs) and untreated (PUPs) pediatric patients with HA. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched clinical studies from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Data were extracted and a single-arm meta-analysis was performed. This systematic review included 16 studies involving 1145 patients. Three studies reported changes in annual bleeding rate (ABR); their results displayed no statistically significant difference in ABR changes in pediatric patients with HA after rFVIII treatment. Ten studies reported inhibitor development, nine focused on PUPs. Here, EHL rFVIII showed a proportion of inhibitors at 27.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.6%; 32.6%), and third-generation SHL rFVIII showed a proportion of inhibitors at 36.4% (27.2%; 46.2%), with a high-titer proportion of 20.9% (12.9%; 30.3%) for the latter. Both SHL rFVIII (octocog alfa) and EHL rFVIII (rurioctocog alfa pegol) presented low proportions of inhibitor development. Octocog alfa exhibited the lowest high-titer inhibitor incidence, marked at 12.7% (5.3%; 24.5%). Eleven studies addressed adverse events (AEs), with octocog alfa showing low reported treatment-related AEs at a proportion of 14.5% (6.5%; 26.7%). Our analysis revealed that both octocog alfa and rurioctocog alfa pegol showed low inhibitor development, with octocog alfa having few treatment-related AEs. Regular monitoring for inhibitors during rFVIII therapy is important."

    "abstract": "Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is caused by autoantibodies that neutralise Factor VIII (FVIII) and can cause severe bleeding. The COVID-19 vaccine may trigger the development of acquired autoantibodies against coagulation factors, which is associated with high morbidity. This is a case of a man who needed medical attention and presented with haematochezia and haematoma formation following a colonoscopy and root canal procedure. Both events were preceded by a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccination. Laboratory data was significant for a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 55 s which prompted a haematology consult. A further work-up revealed the presence of an acquired FVIII inhibitor correlating with a severely reduced activity level. Treatment was given to eradicate the inhibitor with steroids and cyclophosphamide, while a thorough investigation was initiated for possible causes. Prompt recognition of an acquired inhibitor is essential for timely management to control bleeding."

    "title": "Improving functional capacity in haemophilia through adapted physical activity: a pilot study protocol.",
    "abstract": "Haemophilia, a genetic disorder characterised by deficient clotting factors, often leads to musculoskeletal complications such as haemophilic arthropathy. These complications result in reduced functional capacity, muscle weakness and kinesiophobia, which further exacerbate physical inactivity and psychological distress. The World Federation of Haemophilia recommends including regular physical activity in the management plans for individuals with haemophilia, emphasising its benefits for bone and muscle strengthening, improved coordination, maintenance of healthy body weight and enhanced self-esteem. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted physical activity (APA) programme in individuals with haemophilia. The primary objective is to analyse changes in functional capacity following participants' completion of the exercise programme. Additionally, the study evaluates the programme's impact on joint mobility, kinesiophobia, limitations in daily activities and static and dynamic balance. It is hypothesised that the APA programme may improve or maintain joint mobility, increase muscle strength, enhance proprioception and reduce fear of movement (kinesiophobia), thus contributing to an overall improvement in physical function in participants. The intervention is carefully designed to prioritise safety and proper execution. It incorporates low-impact, low- to moderate-intensity exercises tailored to individual joint functionality. Supervised by qualified professionals, the programme aims to minimise excessive joint loading and prevent haemarthrosis while promoting muscle strength, joint mobility and proprioception. The programme is structured into 1-hour sessions held twice weekly for 6 months. Each session has three sections: warm-up, the main part (strength, mobility, proprioception and balance exercises) and cool-down."

This article reports on a patient with post-traumatic AHA who rapidly improved after antibody removal and bypass replacement therapy, followed by wound healing following surgical intervention. A review of relevant literature is also conducted to enhance clinicians' awareness of AHA, which presents with normal coagulation initially and gradually develops into prolonged APTT accompanied by bleeding manifestations, aiming for early diagnosis and timely treatment."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to recurrent joint bleeds, musculoskeletal damage, and chronic pain. The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) recommends prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy to reduce bleeding risk, yet joint deterioration and pain persist. Maintaining high FVIII levels provides clinical benefits but requires awareness of best practices and managed care considerations. This publication examines the clinical and economic impact of hemophilia A, treatment goals, FDA-approved therapies, and managed care factors. People with hemophilia experience lower bone mineral density, increased osteoporosis risk, and significant effects on mental health, mobility, and quality of life. Treatment options-including standard and extended half-life FVIII therapies, non-factor therapies, and gene therapy-vary in sustaining FVIII levels and preventing bleeds. The high cost of care burdens patients and health systems, though prophylaxis reduces emergency visits and hospitalizations. Adherence challenges arise as patients transition to self-infusion, and insurance restrictions often limit access to comprehensive care. The WFH supports individualized, patient-centered management with pharmacokinetic-guided dosing, multidisciplinary care, and shared decision-making. Maximizing FVIII levels, rather than maintaining minimal thresholds, may improve long-term health. A holistic approach-combining early intervention, personalized prophylaxis, and strategies to address treatment barriers-is essential to better outcomes and achieving the WFH goal of zero bleeds."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A and B are congenital X-linked bleeding disorders resulting from deficiencies in clotting factors VIII (haemophilia A) and IX (haemophilia B). Patients with severe deficiency, defined as having less than 1% of normal plasma factor activivity, often have spontaneous bleeding within the first few years of life. Those with moderate and mild deficiencies typically present with post-traumatic or post-surgical bleeding later in life. A high index of suspicion and measurement of factor activity in plasma facilitates early diagnosis. In the 21st century, therapeutic advances and comprehensive care have substantially improved both mortality and morbidity associated with these conditions. Management strategies for haemophilia include on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes and all surgeries and regular treatment (ie, prophylaxis) aimed at reducing bleeds, morbidity, and mortality, thereby enhancing quality of life. Treatment options include factor replacement therapy, non-replacement therapies that increase thrombin generation, and gene therapies that facilitate in vivo clotting factor synthesis. The therapies differ in their use for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment, the mode and frequency of administration, duration of treatment effect, degree of haemostatic protection, and side-effects. Monitoring the effectiveness of these prophylactic therapies involves assessing annual bleeding rates and joint damage. Personalised management strategies, which align treatment with individual goals (eg, playing competitive sports), initiated at diagnosis and maintained throughout the lifespan, are crucial for optimal outcomes. These strategies are facilitated by a multidisciplinary team and supported by clinician-led education for both clinicians and patients."

    "abstract": "As the life expectancy of individuals with hemophilia continues to increase, the complexity of balancing bleeding risks and thrombotic management has become increasingly critical in people with hemophilia with or at a high risk of thrombosis. Advances in hemophilia therapies such as extended half-life coagulation factors, non-factor therapies, rebalancing agents, and gene therapy have expanded treatment options for a variety of people with hemophilia. The thrombotic risk of people with hemophilia in general are relatively low as compared to those without hemophilia. However, antithrombotic therapy for prevention and treatment for thrombosis should still be considered in some situations, even in hemophilia. This clinical focus highlights the use of antithrombotic therapy in the management of thrombosis in people with hemophilia. A multidisciplinary, personalized approach is essential for optimizing the safety and efficacy of antithrombotic therapy in people with hemophilia with or at a high risk of thrombosis. High performance computer based multidimensional data analysis may help in establishing the personalized antithrombotic therapy in the future."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to establish and apply a multicriteria value framework to determine the value of prophylaxis versus on‑demand treatment in adult patients with hemophilia A in China, which could enhance evidence-based care decisions. The framework was developed using key literature to identify dimensions and indicators for assessing the value of hemophilia A. We interviewed 21 stakeholders-including clinical experts, medical insurance experts, health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) experts, charity organization representatives, and patient advocacy organization representatives-to evaluate the relative importance of indicators. The interviewees also assessed the value of prophylaxis and on-demand treatments for adults, providing justification for their ratings. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was employed to calculate the weight of each indicator based on stakeholder ratings. A linear additive value function was used to calculate total value scores. The main outcomes of the study include the weighted indicators of the value framework and the comprehensive value scores for different hemophilia A care strategies. The primary indicators in the value framework were clinical value, economic value, patient value, and social value. These were further broken down into nine secondary indicators. Overall, interviewees rated patient value highest (32.88%), followed by clinical value (30.08%), social value (22.25%), and economic value (14.79%). The adult prophylaxis strategy scored higher than on-demand treatment in all four primary value categories, with the largest difference observed in patient value. The total value score for adult prophylaxis (8.42) was higher than that for on-demand treatment (5.90), with an absolute difference of 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.68-3.36). The hemophilia value framework affirmed value of prophylaxis for adult patients with hemophilia A versus on-demand treatment, with benefit in terms of clinical value, economic value, patient value, and social value. The study also demonstrates that the value framework is an excellent tool for assisting stakeholders in decision-making that is grounded in patient-centered value in China."

FVIII inhibitors may develop in patients with congenital hemophilia A (CHA) in response to infused FVIII (allo-antibodies) or in patients without CHA in a variety of situations (auto-antibodies; acquired hemophilia A). We report updated findings for FVIII inhibitor testing in our geographic region using recent data (testing for the past 5 years; 2020-2024 inclusive) from the RCPAQAP (Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Program), an international external quality assessment (EQA) program, with over 80 enrolments for the FVIII inhibitor module. Four samples are assessed each year, with these comprising both FVIII inhibitor negative samples and FVIII inhibitor positive samples with various inhibitor titers. This EQA data largely evidences favorable findings in FVIII inhibitor testing in our jurisdiction, with >99% of test results interpreted correctly by participants for the presence (\"detected\") or absence (\"not detected\") of FVIII inhibitors in assessed samples. Moreover, most errors in interpretation appear to be transcription or data entry errors rather than analytic errors. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for FVIII inhibitor samples were moderately high, ranging from 25 to 40%, irrespective of the inhibitor titer (range: 3-64 Bethesda units [BU]/mL) or the method (i.e., Bethesda vs. Nijmegen). In conclusion, most laboratories were able to correctly identify the presence versus absence of FVIII inhibitors, although laboratory-reported titers varied moderately."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked disorder due to deficient/defective coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), which causes excessive bleeding either traumatic or spontaneous. Frequent FVIII replacement is complicated by the development of inhibitors. The bispecific monoclonal antibody emicizumab, offers a novel approach by bridging activated factors IXa and X for effective hemostasis. This retrospective study analyzed emicizumab treatment outcomes in 73 patients with severe HA at a tertiary care center in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Data included demographic profiles, bleeding rates, joint health scores, and adverse events (AEs). Emicizumab demonstrated significant efficacy and safety in the study with median patient age of 14 years, with 17/73 patients having FVIII inhibitors. It resulted in a 100% reduction in annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for patients with inhibitors (from 20.7 to 0.0) and a 99.5% reduction for those without inhibitors (from 7.7 to 0.04). All inhibitor-negative patients showed ABR improvements and significant reduction in joint bleeds and resolution of all target joints. Tolerability was favorable with only one patient reporting a non-significant AE. Emicizumab prophylaxis effectively reduces ABRs and enhances joint health in severe HA patients, irrespective of inhibitor presence, providing a convenient, well-tolerated alternative to FVIII therapy."

To address this question, we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 14 haemophilia patients with high titer inhibitors who underwent surgery. The patients with high inhibitors were treated with two SCBT regimens by optimizing doses of the recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). The effectiveness and safety of the two SCBT regimens were evaluated. In addition, rFVIIa and PCC factor consumption and costs were also compared. The median age of the 14 patients was 30.00 (27.25-42.75) years. They all underwent major surgeries, with 85.71% (12/14) was orthopedic surgeries related to hemophilic arthropathy. Four patients were treated using regimen 1 and ten with regimen 2. Results showed that regimen 2 exhibited a higher haemostatic efficiency (90% vs. 75% intraoperative and 90% vs. 50% postoperative) and a 28.0% reduction in economic costs (863,604.68 RMB vs. 621,756.62 RMB). All patients after surgery had no prothrombin time extension, 7.14% had fibrinogen and platelet count decreases, and 57.14% had D-dimer increases that returned to baseline within 5-7 days after SCBT. The study shows that regimen 2 as an optimized SCBT regimen is an efficient approach to secure haemostasis for haemophilia patients with high titer inhibitors in the perioperative period, rather than regimen 1. The findings can help design future clinical studies and provide more reliable data and implementation advice."

The results revealed that younger patients (18-30 years old) exhibited significantly better overall HRQoL scores (total score of 25.36) compared to older age groups (37.81 for the 31-45 group and 43.71 in the 45+ group), particularly in the physical health (29.16 vs. 48.43 vs. 58.57) and mental well-being domains (25 vs. 37.11 vs. 41.07). Interestingly, moderate hemophilia patients reported lower HRQoL (42.31) than those with severe form (34.85), suggesting unique challenges in managing their condition. The 'Sports/Free Time' domain had the highest scores (65.81), indicating significant limitations in physical activities in the everyday lives of affected individuals. However, better outcomes were observed in the mental dimension (36.09), work/study (34.88), family planning (10.68), and relationships aspects (16.67), where our cohort reported very low scores compared to similar studies, indicating a significantly better quality of life in these domains. These findings highlight the importance of personalized psychosocial support and targeted interventions to address the specific needs of hemophilia patients, particularly in enhancing physical activity opportunities and managing the psychological burden of moderate hemophilia. The study contributes valuable insights into the HRQoL of hemophilia patients and underscores the necessity for tailored approaches to improve patient outcomes across all dimensions of life."

Adherence to therapy may be difficult due to the administration mode and the frequency of self-infusions. There is a need to investigate the effect of treatment adherence on clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes in a real-world setting. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to describe the impact of adherence to haemophilia drug therapies on clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched for English language articles published after 22 June 2013; the search was conducted on 22 June 2023. No geographic limits were applied. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies investigated associations between treatment adherence and bleeding, joint health, inhibitor development, pain, QoL, daily activity/work productivity (WP), cognitive function and healthcare resource use. Fifteen studies reported that better adherence to drug therapy in patients with haemophilia is associated with better outcomes, including a reduction in bleeding risk, improved joint structure and function, less chronic pain, better health-related QoL (HRQoL), lower activity impairment (AI), less school/work absenteeism, higher WP and better cognitive function. Two studies reported mixed results, with adherence being associated with some outcomes but not others. Five studies reported no association. This SLR found associations between greater adherence to haemophilia drug therapies and better results on clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes, indicating that patients with haemophilia would benefit from improvements in treatments that promote adherence."

    "abstract": "Intron 22 inversion mutation of F8 (inv22) is the most frequent cause of Haemophilia A (HA) and is present in approximately 45% of severe HA cases. This mutation disrupts F8 gene continuity, leading to a truncated protein. Traditional methods for detecting inv22, including inverse-shifting PCR and long-range PCR, are accurate but labour-intensive. F8 inv22 truncated mRNA transcript contains a short (51 base pairs) abnormal exon 23. Thus, reverse-transcription PCR has been proposed for the diagnosis of inv22 in patients with HA. The aim of this study was to design and validate a multiplex reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay capable of detecting and differentiating between normal and inv22 F8 transcripts in a single reaction. We designed an RT-qPCR assay that employs specific primers and TaqMan probes to detect the exon 22 to 23 junction present in the normal F8 transcript, and the junction between exon 22 and the abnormal sequence only present in F8 transcripts harbouring inv22. We tested our assay in 14 HA patients (six with inv22 and eight with other mutations), four HA female carriers (two with inv22 and two with other mutations), and six negative controls. F8 expression in peripheral blood RNA was sufficient to be detected by RT-qPCR. The assay showed perfect concordance within the cohort to identify inv22 in both patients and carriers. RT-qPCR is an accurate method for diagnosing inv22 in patients and HA carriers. Moreover, it is simpler and faster than previous methods."

To evaluate whether systematic joint examination with HJHS and/or HEAD-US had an impact on treatment management decisions in France, using final data from the A-MOVE study. A-MOVE (NCT04133883) was a 12-month prospective, multicentre study, which enrolled persons with haemophilia A (all severities, aged 6-40 years) treated prophylactically or on demand with standard/extended half-life FVIII replacement. At baseline, 6 and 12 months, HJHS/HEAD-US and changes in patients' management were assessed. Eighty-six patients from 20 sites were included in the final analysis; 68 had HJHS/HEAD-US assessments at 12 months. Over 12 months, 24.4% (n = 21/86) of patients experienced an impact on their haemophilia management due to HJHS/HEAD-US scores; these decisions were impacted by HJHS in about half of the patients (52.4%, n = 11/21) and HEAD-US in almost all patients (95.2%, n = 20/21). Both assessments contributed to a change in management decisions in about half of the patients (47.6%, n = 10/21). Twenty-nine patients (33.7%) had haemophilia management decisions impacted by factors other than HJHS/HEAD-US, including physical examination findings (n = 9) and the occurrence of bleeding episodes (n = 8). Final data from the A-MOVE study show that systematic joint assessments, through functional/physical examination (HJHS) and ultrasound (HEAD-US), may impact treatment management decisions in persons with haemophilia A."

A 20-year-old man with congenital hemophilia A presented with abducens nerve palsy caused by a giant cavernous carotid aneurysm (CCA). Because of the coagulopathy, simple internal carotid artery ligation was chosen, and the aneurysm initially shrank following treatment. However, it recurred due to collateral arteries from the posterior communicating artery and branches of the external carotid artery. These arteries were occluded using endovascular techniques, resulting in complete obliteration of the aneurysm. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of treating a giant CCA associated with hemophilia A. In patients with coagulopathy, surgical options are limited, and standard treatments may not achieve a complete cure. Careful consideration of treatment strategies is crucial when managing giant CCA in the context of a coagulation disorder. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24693."

Eptacog alfa and eptacog beta share the same amino acid sequence but differ in posttranslational modifications. Although rFVIIa has been used to manage bleeding in persons with hemophilia and inhibitors for over 30 years, its mechanisms of action is still being studied. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have suggested that rFVIIa could promote hemostasis by (1) increasing tissue factor-dependent activation of factor (F)X (FX); (2) directly activating FX on the surface of activated platelets; and (3) downregulating protein C anticoagulant activity through binding to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). Studies of rFVIIa and rFVIIa variants in murine models demonstrate that platelet-dependent activity is sufficient for hemostatic efficacy. Dosing levels required in clinical practice are most consistent with a platelet-dependent mechanism of action. However, <i>in vivo</i> models also suggest that pathways involving EPCR binding contribute to rFVIIa hemostatic activity. Eptacog beta displays increased platelet- and EPCR-dependent endothelial cell binding compared to eptacog alfa. Thus, the relative contribution of these mechanisms to the overall hemostatic efficacy of eptacog alfa and eptacog beta may differ. Further research is required to assess the clinical relevance of these differences. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which rFVIIa promotes hemostasis in patients will provide insights when evaluating clinical outcomes of safety and efficacy for innovative bypassing therapies."

    "title": "Investigation of the Relationship Between Self-Management and Kinesiophobia in Haemophiliac Individuals Experiencing Intra-Articular Bleeding.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to examine the relationship between self-management skills and kinesiophobia in haemophilia patients. The findings of the study may contribute to the development of strategies that can help haemophilia patients overcome their fear of movement and improve their quality of life (QoL). This study is planned to examine the relationship between disease self-management in haemophiliac individuals and kinesiophobia that may arise from intra-articular bleeding associated with haemophilia. In this study, both descriptive and analytical research was conducted on individuals who are members of patient associations. Patient Identification Form, Chronic Disease Self-Management Scale and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia were used as data collection tools. Data were collected face to face. Descriptive statistics methods (mean, standard deviation) were used in the evaluation of study data. Quantitative data comparisons were made with the Student's t-test for normally distributed parameters and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed parameters. When there were more than two groups, One-Way ANOVA was used, and in advanced analyses, linear regression analysis was used. A positive correlation was found between the 'self-stigmatization' subdimension of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Scale and kinesiophobia. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between healing compliance and kinesiophobia levels. Flexibility in healing cracks was found in the reduction of kinesiophobia. Self-management of the disease in hemophilic individuals affects compliance with treatment, kinesiophobia, activity level and QoL."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder that causes significant pain and disability. Haemophilia A and B are the most common, with HemA affecting more men and being four times more prevalent. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Faisalabad, Pakistan, to assess pain severity in haemophilia patients based on sociodemographic factors and management approaches. Data were collected through structured interviews and analysed using SPSS version 27.0, examining associations between variables and pain severity. A sample of 200 patients was selected from the 800 registered patients at a haemophilia treatment centre (HTC) in Faisalabad. All participants had severe haemophilia, with 65.5% residing in rural areas. Severe pain was reported by 58% of patients, with higher prevalence among rural residents (35% vs. 22.5% urban, p = 0.004) and those with monthly income below Rs. 15,000 (21%, p < 0.001). Plasma transfusion significantly reduced severe pain risk (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83, p = 0.003), while self-management methods increased it (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.06-3.02, p = 0.03). Distance from treatment centres significantly impacted pain severity, with 21.5% of patients living within 10-50 miles reporting severe pain. Management practices significantly influenced patient outcomes (p < 0.001). Patients face significant pain management challenges owing to sociodemographic factors, low income and limited access to specialized care. Addressing these gaps requires early diagnosis, better access to treatment centres and multidisciplinary pain management strategies. While geographic and economic barriers are considered, future research should include detailed data on rural healthcare quality, assimilate longitudinal data and delve into the links between mental health, pain severity and treatment ease of access."

    "abstract": "To enhance attention on low-income patients with hemophilia, it is essential to urge governments and coagulation factor manufacturers to increase their investment in hemophilia care. This would ensure that low-income patients receive an adequate supply of clotting factors for both replacement therapy and prophylaxis. Clinical data from 171 low-income hemophilia patients were collected in Shandong Province between January 2017 and December 2019. \"Low-income\" is defined as having a per capita disposable income below the average for the years 2017 to 2019 in Shandong Province. The data collected included age, education, activity levels of factor VIII/IX and anti-factor VIII/IX inhibitors, therapeutic regimen, viral infections, and annual bleeding rate (ABR). Additionally, the translated and validated Chinese version of the Haemophilia Quality of Life questionnaire for adults (Haem-QoL-A), Hemophilia Joint Health Scores (HJHS), and annualized consumption of factor VIII or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) were applied. In our study, a total of 171 male patients-131 adults and 40 children-were included, and the median age was 30 years. The average annual income of these patients was $446.9. Of these, 133 patients (77.8%) were diagnosed with hemophiliac arthropathy. Eight out of 150 patients had anti-factor VIII inhibitors, while only one patient had anti-factor IX inhibitors. Among the 171 patients, only six children received low-dose prophylaxis (10-15 IU/kg, 1-2 times per week), while the remaining 165 patients received only inadequate on-demand treatment. In terms of viral infections, 20 patients (11.7%) were infected with transfusion-associated viruses. The median annual bleeding rate (ABR) was 20 bleeding events per year (range: 2-100). The mean Haem-QoL-A score was 62.3 ± 14.5. The mean total Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) for children was 8.1 ± 7.1, and for adults with hemophilia A or B (HA/HB), it was 40.1 ± 20.0 (P < 0.05). The annual per capita factor dosage for the 171 low-income hemophilia patients was calculated to be 6,182 IU/year. Providing additional support and care for low-income patients is crucial. Early prophylaxis in children is particularly important for protecting joint health."

This study aimed to compare hemophilia treatment in the eastern part of Germany in 2021 with data from 2015. Substitution diaries and patient records of PWH from 2021 were collected in 13 hemophilia centers from the \"Kompetenznetz Hämorrhagische Diathese Ost\" (KHDO) and compared with 2015. A total of 130 children and 357 adults, 411 hemophilia A (HA) and 76 hemophilia B (HB), were included in 2021, and 359 were already analyzed in 2015. In 2021, 97.8% of children and 95.7% of adults with severe hemophilia had prophylaxis compared with 98.8 and 80.2% in 2015. Plasma-derived concentrates were used in 25.6%, recombinant in 30.2%, extended half-life (EHL) factor concentrates in 24.4%, and emicizumab in 19.8% of the children with severe HA (sHA). In adults with sHA, plasma-derived, recombinant concentrates, EHL, and emicizumab were used in 21.0, 33.2, 31.2, and 14.2%, respectively. All children and 93.3% of the adults with severe HB (sHB) were on EHL. Median annual factor consumption per body weight increased in adults with sHA, remained stable in children with sHA and adults with sHB, and decreased in children with sHB between 2015 and 2021. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) decreased in children with sHB and sHA. The use of EHL and emicizumab has changed hemophilia treatment. About 50% of the sHA patients switched to EHL or emicizumab and almost all sHB patients to EHL. More adults with sHA received prophylaxis and ABR decreased in children."

    "abstract": "The aim of this qualitative study is to determine and evaluate the problems faced by people with hemophilia aged 18-35 years in their social lives. In this qualitative type research, 13 individuals aged 18-35 years with hemophilia were reached with snowball sampling and online interviews with them. Participants were asked about their sociodemographic characteristics and the problems they encountered in various fields related to hemophilia using a semi-structured question guide with open-ended questions. Thematic content analysis was carried out. Most participants were diagnosed with hemophilia in early childhood and have maintained knowledge of the condition since then. Hemophilia-related complications often resulted in significant educational delays, with two participants unable to complete formal schooling. Experiences of stigmatization in school were commonly reported. Some families faced migration or job changes due to the financial burden of hemophilia. While the majority viewed current healthcare services in Türkiye as sufficient, access issues in rural areas were noted. Nearly all participants belonged to a hemophilia-related non-governmental organization, which they felt had greatly enhanced their quality of life. To improve the social well-being of people with hemophilia, awareness campaigns to reduce stigma and foster a more supportive social environment are needed."

This is a single-centre, comparative, observational, sequential, retrospective, and multidisciplinary study. Population pharmacokinetic models from the WAPPS-Hemo® application were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters and individualise prophylaxis. The annual rate of total and joint bleeds, joint health (Haemophilia Joint Health Score), plasma half-life and area under the curve ratios, FVIII consumption, administration frequency, and cost were analysed. Thirty-eight adult patients with haemophilia A who switched from standard half-life FVIII to extended half-life pegylated FVIII were analysed. Significant improvements (P < .05) were observed in all pharmacokinetic parameters, with plasma half-life and area under the curve improvement ratios of 1.5 and 1.9, respectively, as well as reductions in annual total and joint bleeding rates. A higher number of patients with zero total (16.0 vs. 29.0) and joint bleeds (23.0 vs. 33.0) was also observed. The median reductions in administration frequency and dose/kg/week were 30.0% and 19.7%, respectively, avoiding 44.3 infusions/patient/year, resulting in savings of 20,843 €/patient/year. Furthermore, joint health improved (23.0 vs. 21.0; P = .017), and target joints resolved after the switch. The pharmacokinetically guided switch from standard half-life FVIII to pegylated FVIII demonstrated significant clinical benefits with reduced bleeding rates and improvements in joint health. Additionally, improvements in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed, allowing for reduced treatment burden by decreasing administration frequency, as well as lower consumption and costs."

    "abstract": "Prophylaxis with coagulation factor concentrates is the mainstay of treatment in severe hemophilia A and B. Data on bleeding rates in persons with congenital haemophilia B (PwcHB) receiving prophylaxis are inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed at assessing bleeding outcomes, including annualised bleeding rates (ABR) and the proportion of patients with zero bleeding events, in PwcHB receiving prophylaxis with plasma-derived or recombinant FIX products with standard (rSHL) or extended half-life (rEHL). A systematic search was conducted using the bibliographic database Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024592785). The search yielded 2440 citations and a total of 42 studies (2 randomised and 40 nonrandomised) were included in the final analysis. The pooled estimated mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) ABR was significantly lower in PwcHB treated prophylactically with rEHL FIX than in those receiving rSHL FIX products (1.29 [95% CI: 0.91, 1.66] vs. 3.12 [95% CI: 2.63, 3.62], p < 0.01). The proportion of participants with zero bleeding events was significantly higher in PwcHB treated prophylactically with rEHL FIX than in those receiving rSHL FIX (0.53 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.69] vs. 0.24 [95% CI: 0.14, 0.39], p = 0.01). The ABR did not differ according to age groups (more or less than 12 years). The results of this meta-analysis suggest that compared to standard half-life FIX concentrates, prophylaxis with rEHL FIX products is associated with a reduction in ABR and a higher proportion of patients with no bleeding episodes."

Assess which chromogenic substrate assays (CSAs) accurately monitor FVIII:C and FVIII inhibitor levels in the presence of Mim8. FVIII and Mim8 were spiked into congenital FVIII-deficient plasma to obtain mixtures containing various FVIII:C levels (0-100 IU/dL) and Mim8 concentrations (0, 3, 6 and 12 µg/mL). Five CSAs using different activated Factor IX and X sources (bovine, bovine-human or human) were used to measure FVIII:C. Bovine and bovine-human CSAs were then used to measure FVIII:C of standard half-life (SHL) and extended half-life (EHL) FVIII products. FVIII inhibitor levels were assessed using two different bovine CSAs in congenital FVIII-deficient plasma spiked with various Mim8 concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40 µg/mL) and FVIII inhibitor levels (0.2, 1.0 and 4.8 BU). High levels of interference were observed using human CSAs. Bovine CSAs accurately measured FVIII:C of SHL and EHL FVIII products in the presence of Mim8 without interference. In bovine-human CSAs, interference was observed at 5 IU/dL FVIII, increasing up to four-fold with increasing Mim8 levels. FVIII inhibitor levels were accurately measured using bovine CSAs without Mim8 interference. FVIII:C of SHL and EHL products and FVIII inhibitor levels can be accurately monitored in the presence of Mim8 using bovine CSAs at all FVIII levels, and bovine-human CSAs at FVIII concentrations >20 IU/dL."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A, caused by a deficiency in factor VIII (F8), is a promising target for gene therapy. This study aims to enhance the efficacy of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vectors, specifically those encoding B-domain-deleted F8 (BDDF8), to treat the condition. We focused on improving therapeutic outcomes by strategically deleting amino acids at the furin cleavage site (RHQR), a modification that is crucial for increasing F8 expression and reducing capsid stress during vector packaging. Using computational modeling with AlphaFold2, combined with western blotting and in vivo clotting assays, we developed and tested several AAV8-BDDF8 variants in a hemophilia A mouse model. The AAV8-BDDF8-ΔRHQR10 variant, which includes a 10-amino acid deletion at the RHQR site, demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in F8 activity, with sustained expression and no hepatotoxicity. This variant also showed reduced capsid stress and enhanced protein expression. However, the observed decline in long-term efficacy highlights the ongoing challenges in AAV-F8 gene therapy, emphasizing the need for continuous improvements. Our findings offer valuable insights for refining AAV-mediated gene therapy in hemophilia A, showing that targeted molecular modifications can significantly enhance therapeutic performance while ensuring safety."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Childhood hemophilia, a hereditary bleeding disorder predominantly affecting males, arises due to gene mutations encoding clotting factors VIII or IX. Intracranial hemorrhage represents a significant and life-threatening complication in pediatric patients with hemophilia. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in children with hemophilia, although relatively low, is notably higher compared to the general pediatric population. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, the objective is to examine patients with hemophilia who have experienced intracranial hemorrhage retrospectively. This study is a multicenter, retrospective analysis using data from three tertiary care centers in a provincial city in Turkey. Data were obtained from the participants' hospital records. The presence of inhibitors against FVIII in the participants and the prophylaxis used against them were included in the analysis. Trauma history was queried, with types of traumas examined, including traffic accidents, falls, and a traumatic vaginal delivery. The duration and causes of complaints among the participants were investigated. The causes of complaints were categorized as fever, hematoma, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and hemiparesis. The participants' Physical Examination Findings were classified as fever, hematoma, and loss of consciousness. The duration of hospital stays was evaluated. The hemorrhage location was classified into five groups: parenchymal, subdural, scalp, subarachnoid, and multiple hemorrhagic foci. The recurrence of bleeding, the need for transfusion, surgical intervention, and mortality were also examined. <b>Results</b>: A significant difference was identified between the participants' survival rates and age variables, as well as transfusion in <36 months. A total of 9 participants had spontaneous intracranial bleeding, 2 experienced cranial trauma as a result of traffic accidents, and 25 participants were exposed to head trauma due to falls. Of the remaining individuals, one suffered head trauma from a severe impact, and one had cranial trauma following a traumatic vaginal delivery. Fourteen participants required transfusion, and three underwent surgical intervention. <b>Conclusions</b>: According to the results of the statistical analyses, the variables Factor Level, Physical Examination Findings, Transfusion, Recurrent Bleeding, Inhibitor, and Prophylaxis were found to affect survival significantly. No significant relationship was determined between the other analyzed variables and survival. During our study, five of the participants examined died. Accordingly, the mortality rate identified in our study is 13.1%."

Two sporadic DNV events were determined. One event occurred in grandparents, consisting of five maternal grandmothers and seven maternal grandfathers, who were the origins; their respective daughters became carrier mothers who gave birth to probands. The other event included 11 mothers, who were the origins exclusively; their respective sons became probands. In this study, we found that sporadic HA-NIVs originate mostly from females (16 out of 23). Our study contributes to a better understanding of the genetic pathogenesis of HA."

In vitro, GP@MBG-Cu-TA cryogel displays a good biocompatibility, hemostatic and antimicrobial capability. In vivo studies, GP@MBG-Cu-TA cryogel can enhance the hemostatic effect in the liver injury in SD rats for the acute bleeding, as well as in the aplastic anemia and hemophilia A mice with tail amputation for the persistent bleeding. In addition, GP@MBG-Cu-TA cryogel accelerates the skin wound repair in the mice with the bacterial contamination at the injury site. In sum, GP@MBG-Cu-TA cryogel is not only endowed with dual function of hemostatic and antimicrobial capability, but also can stop bleeding of the objects with either normal or abnormal coagulation function. Thus, GP@MBG-Cu-TA cryogel provides a promising candidate dressing for managing bleeding and bacterial complications in clinic."

    "abstract": "Early prophylaxis is the gold standard of care for severe haemophilia. The development of subcutaneous Factor VIII (FVIII) mimetics, such as emicizumab, has significantly reduced the disease burden and improved protection against bleeding episodes. Despite its benefits, emicizumab does not fully normalize haemostasis, requiring additional FVIII treatment for surgical procedures and management of breakthrough bleeding. In these cases, extended or ultra-extended half-life FVIII products are most commonly used. However, laboratory monitoring of these combinations can be challenging. This study investigates the in vitro combined haemostatic activity of emicizumab with efmoroctocog alfa and efanesoctocog alfa using a thrombin generation assay (TGA). TGA can be used to monitor combined treatment with emicizumab and either efmoroctocog alfa or efanesoctocog alfa, which is not possible with currently available FVIII reagents for the latter. As expected, there is no synergistic effect between the mimetic and FVIII at therapeutical doses. Both efmoroctocog alfa and efanesoctocog alfa show similar in vitro procoagulant activity in terms of thrombin generation."

Subjects received both the test and the reference product with a 7-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetic assessments were conducted over five days post-administration to evaluate the primary outcome, the dose-normalized area under the curve (DNAUC). The results established bioequivalence between rFVIII-Fc (AryoGen Pharmed Company) and Elocta<sup>®</sup>, based on the DNAUC as the primary outcome, in which the ratio of test and reference products was calculated to be 108.56 (90% confidence interval 104.88 to 112.37), falling within the pre-defined equivalence margin of 80-125%. Secondary outcomes, including area under the curve (AUC<sub>inf</sub>), maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and half-life, further supported bioequivalence. Safety profiles were comparable, with adverse events mainly related to haemophilia A rather than the intervention. In conclusion, the rFVIII-Fc product is bioequivalent to Elocta<sup>®</sup> with a similar safety profile, offering an effective alternative for severe haemophilia A patients.

These may be life-threatening, result in permanent joint damage, chronic pain, difficulties with mobility/daily activities, and impact quality of life. In the XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495), once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU/kg) prophylaxis provided highly effective bleed prevention and high-sustained factor levels for most of the week and was well-tolerated. We report post hoc analysis of bleeding episodes and their treatment in previously treated patients (≥ 12 years old). Participants received 50 IU/kg efanesoctocog alfa either as once-weekly prophylaxis (Arm A) or on-demand followed by once-weekly prophylaxis (Arm B) in XTEND-1. Endpoints included treatment of bleeding episodes and response to treatment. During XTEND-1, 422 bleeding episodes were reported among 159 participants; 362 were treated. Most treated bleeding episodes (74%; n = 268) occurred during the Arm B on-demand period, of which 197 (74%) were spontaneous. Seventy-five participants had no bleeding episodes in Arm A; all in Arm B had ≥ 1 bleeding episode while on-demand. Most participants (n = 107, 81%) had zero treated spontaneous bleeding episodes and rates of treated bleeding episodes in Arm A (prophylaxis) were low (median [interquartile range] overall ABR: 0.00 [0.00-1.04]). A single injection was sufficient to resolve 97% (350/362) of treated bleeding episodes, no bleeding episodes required > 3 injections, and responses to 95% of evaluable injections were rated excellent/good. Median total dose was 50.9 IU/kg per bleeding episode. Results of this analysis further demonstrated that once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa provides highly effective bleed protection and treatment of bleeding episodes in participants with severe hemophilia A.

While joint aspiration has proven effective, the role of intra-articular (IA) tranexamic acid (TXA) in managing acute hemarthrosis remains unexplored. To assess the efficacy and safety of knee aspiration followed by IA TXA injection in acute haemophilic knee hemarthrosis. Forty-four adult haemophilia patients with acute knee hemarthrosis (< 24 h) were randomized to undergo joint aspiration with (TXA group) or without (non-TXA group) IA TXA (1.5 g/15 mL) injection. Both groups received 75 mL injections, including 5 mL of 2% lidocaine and additional 0.9% saline. Ultrasound confirmed hemarthrosis, and standardized factor replacement was given pre-procedure. Primary outcomes included knee range of motion (ROM) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. The significance was set at p < 0.05. Final analysis included 21 and 17 male patients in the TXA and non-TXA groups, respectively. The TXA group showed a significantly greater knee ROM on days 3, 7, and 14 (p < 0.05), with no differences beyond Day 14. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the TXA group at 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days post-procedure (p < 0.05). TXA patients reported faster return to work (p = 0.004) and higher satisfaction (p = 0.01). Hemarthrosis recurrence was lower in the TXA group (5.9% vs. 14.3% at 6 weeks; 64.7% vs. 90.5% at 6 months), though differences were not statistically significant. No complications were observed. Joint aspiration with IA TXA is safe and effective for short-term ROM improvement and pain relief in acute haemophilic knee hemarthrosis."

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a manual therapy protocol based on joint and myofascial techniques in patients with haemophilic ankle arthropathy. A randomized, single-blind pilot study. Twenty-four patients with haemophilia were randomized to the experimental (manual therapy) and control (no intervention) groups. The intervention lasted for 3 weeks, with one 50-min weekly session. Techniques used: active-passive joint mobilization, articulatory technique, joint decompression and high-speed and short-stroke manipulation, and sustained myofascial induction techniques. The study variables were safety of the intervention (number of hemarthroses), joint pain intensity (visual analogue scale), pressure pain threshold (pressure algometer), range of ankle motion (Leg Motion) and joint condition (Haemophilia Joint Health Score). None of the patients developed ankle hemarthrosis during the intervention. After the intervention there were intergroup differences in the variables pain intensity (MD = -0.45; p < 0.001), ROM (MD = 0.19; p = 0.003), joint condition (MD = 0.04; p = 0.03) and pressure pain threshold in the internal malleolus (MD = 1.36; p = 0.01). For the interaction time*group after the follow-up period, there were statistically significant differences in pain intensity (F = 6.94; p = 0.01) and dorsal flexion (F = 3.36; p = 0.04) of the ankle. Manual therapy based on joint and myofascial techniques is safe in haemophilia patients. A protocol implementing joint and myofascial techniques having the dosage and safety parameters established in this study can improve the intensity of pain and dorsal flexion of the ankle in these patients.

    "abstract": "Clinical trials and real-world evidence have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of rVIII-SingleChain in previously treated patients with haemophilia A. To investigate the safety and efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain in previously untreated patients (PUPs). In an open-label, phase 3, extension study, PUPs with severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%) received rVIII-SingleChain prophylactically or on-demand. The primary endpoints were incidence of high-titre (HT) inhibitor formation to FVIII, treatment success for major bleeding episodes and annualised spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR). Twenty-four PUPs (median age 1 year [range 0-5]) were treated with rVIII-SingleChain; median time on study was 35.0 months (range 2.4-54.0). Overall, six PUPs developed a HT inhibitor (>5 BU/mL) and six developed a low-titre (LT) inhibitor (≤5 BU/mL). The median number of exposure days at inhibitor development was 10 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.0-14.0). Of 11 inhibitor-positive PUPs (five HT, six LT) who continued rVIII-SingleChain therapy, nine (81.8%; three HT, six LT) achieved inhibitor eradication (<0.6 BU/mL). Median time to eradication was 14.3 weeks (IQR 9.8-53.8). Seventeen treatment-emergent adverse events in 12 PUPs (50.0%) were related to rVIII-SingleChain, mainly inhibitor development (14/17 events). Treatment was successful (haemostatic efficacy rated excellent or good) for 290/315 bleeding events (92.1%). During prophylactic therapy, inhibitor-negative PUPs had a median (IQR) AsBR of 0.52 (0.00-4.99) and annualised bleeding rate of 1.98 (0.77-11.23). RVIII-SingleChain demonstrated a satisfactory benefit:risk profile in PUPs, with a high treatment success rate and a low AsBR during prophylaxis, and was effective at eradicating inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare and potentially severe bleeding disorder caused by circulating autoantibodies against factor VIII (FVIII). In approximately 50% of the patients, the condition is associated with autoimmune diseases, cancers, medication use, pregnancy, and the post-partum period. Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease associated with tissue-bound and circulating autoantibodies against BP antigens 180 (BP180) and 230 (BP230). AHA-associated BP has a high mortality rate; hence, the understanding of this disease must improve. A 69-year-old man presented with erythema, blisters, blood blisters, and crusts accompanied by severe pruritus for more than 20 days, and ecchymosis and swelling on his left upper arm for 3 days. Pathological examination revealed a subepidermal blister that contained eosinophils. Laboratory tests showed that the BP180 autoantibody levels had increased, isolated activated partial thromboplastin time was notably prolonged (115.6 s), and coagulation FVIII activity was extremely low (< 1.0%). Furthermore, the FVIII inhibitor titer had greatly increased (59.2 Bethesda units). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having BP associated with AHA, prescribed 0.05% topical halometasone cream, and transferred to a higher-level hospital for effective treatment; however, he died after 2 days. AHA associated BP is rare, dangerous, and has a high mortality rate. Therefore, its timely diagnosis and effective treatment are necessary."

    "abstract": "Patients with end-stage haemophilic arthritis (HA) are often hesitant about joint replacement surgery, yet little is known about the decision experiences faced by these patients. The aim of this study was to better understand the experiences faced by patients with HA when making decisions about joint replacement surgery and to provide a reference for health care professionals in the development of decision-making aids. Fifteen HA patients who were candidates for joint replacement surgery at a tertiary and first-class hospital in Zhejiang Province were interviewed using a semistructured in-depth interview from January to December 2023. Colaizzi's seven-step method was used to analyse the data and refine the themes. The decision experience for patients with HA regarding joint replacement surgery can be summarized into four themes: decision information conflict, decision support conflict, self-perceived conflict, and self-developmental conflict. Patients with HA face numerous decision conflicts. Health care professionals should develop joint replacement surgery decision-making aids suitable for patients with HA as soon as possible to reduce the decision conflict. The study received approval from the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China (registration date: September 22, 2023; registration number: 2023-KLS-294-01)."

    "abstract": "Clinical trial programs for inherited bleeding disorders feature an array of innovative prophylaxis options: engineered clotting factor concentrates, FVIIIa mimetics, gene therapies, and biologics to bolster thrombin generation (rebalancing agents). Increasingly, non-hemophilia bleeding disorders and a broader demographic (females, children, and infants) are being incorporated into study populations. Ongoing clinical trials broadly address three themes: (1) indication expansion for licensed therapeutics in previously uninvestigated patient subgroups or clinical scenarios, (2) evaluation of efficacy and safety among other bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease, platelet function defects, and rare clotting factor deficiencies, and (3) longitudinal assessment of approved treatments particularly with regard to longer-term efficacy outcomes such as musculoskeletal health and treatment-specific safety outcomes including thrombotic risk and liver health. With these new prophylaxis modalities, providers must have a nuanced understanding of each therapy's mechanism of action, advantages, side effect profile, therapeutic limitations, and impact on hemostasis and laboratory monitoring. Treatment is no longer \"one size fits all.\" Rather, management is tailored to individual needs and preferences. Here, we review active investigational trials and highlight promising approaches in preclinical development, expanding the innovative, complex landscape of inherited bleeding disorders therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII, <i>F8</i>) result in the bleeding disorder hemophilia A. An emerging novel therapeutic strategy for bleeding disorders is to enhance hemostasis by limiting natural anticoagulants, such as antithrombin (AT3). To study pro/anticoagulant hemostatic balance in an <i>in vivo</i> model, we used genome editing to create null alleles for <i>f8</i> and von Willebrand factor (<i>vwf</i>) in zebrafish, a model organism with a high degree of homology to the mammalian hemostatic system and unique attributes, including external development and optical transparency. <i>f8</i> homozygous mutant larvae surprisingly formed normal thrombi when subjected to laser-mediated endothelial injury, had no overt signs of hemorrhage, but had a modest increase in mortality. We have previously shown that <i>at3</i> <sup>-<i>/</i>-</sup> larvae develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with spontaneous thrombosis and fibrinogen consumption, resulting in bleeding phenotype marked by secondary lack of induced thrombus formation upon endothelial injury. We found that with loss of FVIII (<i>f8</i> <sup>-/-</sup>;<i>at3</i> <sup>-/-</sup>), larvae no longer developed spontaneous fibrin thrombi and did produce clots in response to endothelial injury. However, homozygous loss of zebrafish Vwf failed to rescue the <i>at3</i> DIC phenotype. These studies demonstrate an altered balance of natural anticoagulants that mitigates FVIII deficiency in zebrafish, similar to human clinical pipeline products. The data also suggest that zebrafish FVIII might circulate independently of Vwf. Further study of this unique balance could provide new insights for management of hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease."

When persons with nonsevere hemophilia A (NSHA) develop inhibitors, they are at risk of developing severe bleeding manifestations like persons with severe hemophilia A (SHA). Evidence to guide inhibitor eradication in this population is limited as opposed to persons with SHA who develop inhibitors. Hence, inhibitor eradication strategies in NSHA are based on observational and retrospective data and are largely adopted from evidence derived from SHA with inhibitors. Can immune tolerance induction be used for patients with NSHA who develop inhibitors? In this case series, we describe our single institutional experience with the management of 5 persons with NSHA who developed FVIII inhibitors, leading to significant bleeding complications, and underwent successful immune tolerance induction with eradication of FVIII inhibitor. More research specific to persons with NSHA with inhibitors is warranted to develop guidelines regarding indications and strategies for inhibitor eradication therapy."

    "abstract": "Desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin), formerly introduced for the treatment of diabetes insipidus, is a well-known analog of vasopressin, that is, antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Subsequently, after the late 1970s, it has emerged as the medication of choice for type 1 von Willebrand's disease (vWD) and minor hemophilia A. Prothrombotic factors FVIII and von Willebrand factor (vWF) are released from storage sites when vasopressin receptors are targeted by desmopressin. It also facilitates platelet-vessel wall adhesion, resulting in a substantial hemostatic effect. Research studies have shown that desmopressin administration can lead to up to a fourfold increase in vWF levels, highlighting its hemostatic actions. Desmopressin is commonly used in conditions like nocturnal polyuria leading to nocturia or nocturnal enuresis, diabetes insipidus, von Willebrand disease, uremic bleeding, and hemophilia A. Desmopressin is also used to avoid rapid sodium correction along with hypertonic saline, management of intracranial bleed due to the use of antiplatelet agents, and trauma resuscitation with active hemorrhage. It is also used in bleeding disorders, dental extractions, epistaxis, and menstrual bleeding. Hence, it is imperative that clinicians become acquainted with the use of desmopressin, which has become a common medication for many patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Desmopressin is included in the treatment guidelines for vWD."

    "abstract": "To explore the factors that affect the efficacy of knee replacement surgery in hemophiliacs. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 patients with hemophilia (PWH) (117knees) who underwent knee arthroplasty in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2020 (mean follow-up 70.8 ± 22 months). General information, hemophilia information, surgical information, follow-up information and psychological assessment information were collected. The knee joint efficacy was evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee score, the American Knee Society's Clinical (KSC) and Functional (KSF) scores, flexion contracture degree (FC), range of motion (ROM), and wound healing. The excellent and poor groups were divided based on these factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze factors that may affect the knee joint efficacy of patients. Seventy-four cases of excellent knee joints and 43 cases of poor knee joints were included. Single factor analysis: The pre-ROM, SF-12MCS, HSS, KSF, and KSC of the excellent group were significantly higher than those of the poor group (P < 0.05); the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Preoperative Visual Analogue Scale(Pre-VAS), pre-FC degree of the excellent group were significantly lower than those of the poor group (P < 0.05). The proportion of patients undergoing Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement, severe hemophilia, and quadricepsplasty during surgery in the excellent group was significantly lower than that in the poor group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression: Pre-ROM and Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement are independent risk factors affecting knee joint efficacy. Pre-ROM is positively correlated with knee joint efficacy, while Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement is negatively correlated. In PWH, the efficacy of knee replacement surgery is related to preoperative ROM and Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement. Better preoperative knee joint mobility is associated with improved outcomes, whereas Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement negatively impacts surgical efficacy."

A retrospective database search identified five patients with severe factor 8 deficiencies who underwent simultaneous hip and knee joint replacement surgery between 2002-2018. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations included Harris Hip Score (HHS), Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), range of motion, flexion contracture (FC), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), hip-knee angle, and leg length discrepancy. The mean age of the patients was 50.8 years, with a mean follow-up duration of 60 months. Preoperative knee ROM was 55 degrees, improving to 73.8 degrees postoperatively. Preoperative knee FC was 13.7 degrees, improving to 10 degrees postoperatively. HHS increased from 45.6 to 75.7, KSS increased from 36 to 69.3, and KOOS total score increased from 34.4 to 82.7. VAS scores decreased from 6.3 to 1.3. One patient experienced prolonged bleeding and subsequent complications, while the others showed significant improvements. Simultaneous hip and knee arthroplasties in hemophiliacs may provide benefits in terms of physical and functional gains. However, the increased risk of complications necessitates careful patient selection. For patients with comorbidities, staged surgeries may be advisable to avoid potential complications.

Study results include joint function, complication and various cost. Literature quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Outcomes were evaluated with fixed-effects or random-effects models, while heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. Nine studies involving 309 haemophilia patients were included, with 166 in SKA group and 143 in BKA group. No statistically significant differences were observed between the SKA and BKA groups in range of motion (95% CI: -0.22 [-3.57, 3.13], p = 0.90), Hospital for Special Surgery score (95% CI: -2.13 [-4.89, 0.64], p = 0.13), flexion degree (95% CI: -2.38 [-7.22, 2.46], p = 0.33), cost (95% CI: -0.24 [-0.94, 0.45], p = 0.49), complication rate (95% CI: 1.31 [-0.79, 2.17], p = 0.29), hospital stay (95% CI: 0.25 [-2.06, 2.57], p = 0.83), and coagulation factor usage (p = 0.49).

Developing a common and understandable language to discuss gene editing will be essential to ensure these treatments can be deployed in a safe and effective manner with fully informed and shared decision-making between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and PWH. A lexicon explaining and clarifying key concepts is one potential tool to address these aims. Here we evaluate how a gene editing lexicon could be deployed to maximise impact and improve patient outcomes. To operationalise the gene editing lexicon for successful adoption by the haemophilia community. Through an innovative, iterative process, representatives from the haemophilia community, including multidisciplinary HCPs, PWH, and caregivers, with support from language strategy experts, developed a gene editing lexicon and evaluated operational aspects for real-world adoption of this resource. A gene editing lexicon was developed, including infographics illustrating key concepts. Infographics were adapted from the lexicon to further clarify and communicate these concepts. Infographics were found to be a potentially vital tool for enhancing the practical use of the lexicon to promote shared decision-making and attain informed consent for gene editing therapies. A gene editing lexicon shows promise for improving the understanding of gene editing for all stakeholders in the haemophilia community. Ensuring the lexicon remains up to date with current therapies and appropriate strategies for adoption such as infographics will enable this resource to have maximum impact."

It is of great clinical importance to evaluate the motor development of these infants with a standardized assessment tool. To study the gross motor development in infants with haemophilia, using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and compare it with full-term (FT) and preterm infants (PT). Fifteen FT infants with severe or moderate haemophilia A and B were assessed with the AIMS (Group D). The scale is already standardized in FT Greek infants (Group A). Two groups of PT infants were also included, with gestational age >32 weeks and ≤32 weeks, Groups B and C, respectively. The mean Z-scores were tested with the ANOVA procedure, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction. The four groups had significantly different mean Z-scores. Infants in Group A had a mean Z-score of 0 ± 1. Infants in Group B lagged significantly behind by one standard deviation. Preterm infants in Group C had a mean Z-score significantly lower than Group B. Infants in Group D had a mean Z-score significantly lower than Group C. Motor development in infants with haemophilia significantly lags behind both FT and PT infants. Differences in AIMS scores could be attributed to the reduction of movement activity, since infants with haemophilia are often deprived of certain positions, being held and carried in the parents' arms, as well as from free play time on the floor."

However, large interindividual variability is observed in DDAVP response and determinants are largely unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify the response to DDAVP and the factors that determine DDAVP response in patients. We included studies with patients with any bleeding disorder receiving DDAVP. First and second screening round and risk of bias assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The main outcome was proportion of patients with complete (factor level >50 U/dL) or partial (30-50 U/dL) response to DDAVP. Determinants of response including disease type, age, sex, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) mutations, and baseline factor levels were investigated. In total, 591 articles were found and 103 were included. Of these, 71 articles (1772 patients) were suitable for the study's definition of response. Meta-analysis showed a pooled response proportion of 0.71 (0.64; 0.78) and a significant difference in response between disease subtypes. For hemophilia A, baseline FVIII activity (FVIII:C) was a borderline significant determinant of response. In patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) type 1, VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF activity, and FVIII:C were significant determinants. A large variation in response was observed for specific mutations in VWF and FVIII. Response to DDAVP varied between disease subtypes and was largely determined by the baseline levels of FVIII:C for hemophilia A and VWF:Ag for VWD. Our findings highlight the significant differences in response and emphasize the need for a standardized response definition and further research into response mechanisms."

Twenty-eight (28/78) patients underwent surgical/dental procedures without bleeding complications except for 2 patients (7.1%). Thirty-three patients experienced 62 factor-treated bleeding episodes with only 11 imaging-confirmed joint/muscle bleeding episodes among 8 patients. No major safety concerns were reported in the study and emicizumab was discontinued in 5 patients (2 for antidrug antibody development, 2 for joint bleeding, and 1 for non-compliance). Emicizumab prophylaxis was well tolerated with no new safety concerns, and 45 patients (57.7%) of our cohort exhibited zero-treated bleeds, which was comparable to other published experiences."

On 11 January 2025, a bibliographic search was carried out in PubMed using 'hemophilia sports' as keywords. A total of 411 articles were found, of which only 22 were finally analyzed because they were directly related to the title of this article (inclusion criterion). The remaining 389 were eliminated because they were not directly related to the title of the article (exclusion criterion). It was found that sports activity is essential for patients with severe hemophilia to maintain joints' range of motion, diminish joint bleeding, enhance muscle mass and strength, improve proprioception, muscular trophism and bone mineral density, and avert secondary joint degeneration. PWH with factor levels < 10% during sports had a bleeding risk of 41% versus 20% in those with higher factor levels (>10%). Prophylaxis therapy can permit patients with severe hemophilia to participate in vigorous activities or high-impact sports. Moreover, such activities or sports have a positive effect on patient's psychosocial health. Therefore, sports practice should be supported in people with severe hemophilia but patient counseling and tailoring prophylaxis therapy with clotting factors and non-replacement therapy is essential."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is associated with FVIII coagulation insufficiency or inactivity leading to excessive bleeding. Elevated FVIII, on the contrary, is associated with thrombophilia, thrombosis, myocardial infarctions, and stroke. Active FVIII (aFVIII) uses its C2 domain to bind to blood cells' membranes, consequently carrying out its coagulative function. We developed a reliable flow cytometry (FC) method for FVIII detection that can be utilized for assessing surface-bound FVIII on leukocytes in different coagulation/clinical states; we analyzed 49 pediatric subjects, encompassing patients with HA, other coagulopathies, venous thrombosis, and normal coagulation. Interestingly, the total leukocyte surface FVIII showed a declining trend across thrombosis, normal, and hypo-coagulation states. As expected, the leukocytes of HA patients displayed significantly lower levels of cellular-surface FVIII in comparison to patients with thrombosis. However, no significant correlation was observed between circulating levels of FVIII in plasma and the levels of FVIII bound to leukocytes, indicating that the differences in FVIII surface binding are not directly proportional to the availability of FVIII in the circulation and suggesting a specific binding mechanism governing the interaction between FVIII and leukocytes. Intriguingly, when analyzing the distinct blood subpopulations, we observed that surface FVIII levels were significantly elevated in classical monocytes of thrombosis patients compared to HA patients, healthy controls, and patients with other coagulopathies. Our study highlights the reliability of our FC platform in assessing FVIII abundance on leukocytes' membranes across coagulation states. Monocytes, particularly in cases of thrombosis, exhibit active binding of FVIII on their surface, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis that requires further investigation."

To assess the association between TG parameters, emicizumab levels, and bleeding in patients on emicizumab therapy. A single-center longitudinal cohort study was conducted, with samples collected during the steady-state phase of emicizumab therapy. TG was measured using tissue factor (TF; TF-TG, 1 pM) and FXIa (FXIa-TG, 200 pM). Emicizumab concentrations were determined with mass spectrometry. Only treated bleeds were recorded. Pearson correlations (rho, <i>r</i>) were reported. Eighty-five samples from 49 patients were analyzed during a median of 1 year of emicizumab therapy. Most bleeds were traumatic (97%; <i>n</i> = 30), whereas 1 bleed was spontaneous. At 12 months, TF-TG (<i>r</i> = 0.42) showed a borderline correlation, and FXIa-TG (<i>r</i> = 0.15) showed no correlation with emicizumab concentrations. Although FXIa-TG showed a 9% higher endogenous thrombin potential in patients with zero vs ≥1 treated bleed (endogenous thrombin potential: 957 vs 878 nM/min, <i>P</i> = .045), neither the FXIa-peak height nor TF-TG showed any association with traumatic bleeding. TG parameters showed no clinically relevant correlations with emicizumab plasma concentrations, were not associated with traumatic bleeding, and showed considerable intrapatient variability. Therefore, TG was not considered useful for monitoring coagulation potential in patients on steady-state emicizumab prophylaxis."

Does dynamic balance affect the quality of life in these patients? This cross-sectional study included thirty male children aged 7-18 years diagnosed with hemophilia, along with thirty healthy male children as controls. Dynamic balance was evaluated using the limits of stability (LOS) test and a fall risk test, both conducted via the Biodex Balance System. The quality of life for the hemophilia group was measured using the Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index (Haemo-QoL). The results of the LOS test were compared between the groups using Student's t-test, and the fall risk test was undertaken with the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations between balance assessments and Haemo-QoL scores were determined using Spearman's correlation test. The median age was 13 years (interquartile range [IQR]=8) in the hemophilia group and 15 years (IQR=8) in the control group, with no significant age difference (p = 0.952). The hemophilia group scored significantly lower on LOS overall (p = 0.016), backward (p = 0.041), backward/right (p = 0.025), and backward/left (p = 0.005) measures. Fall risk scores were significantly higher in the hemophilia group (p = 0.024). LOS overall and fall risk scores had no correlation with Haemo-QoL scores (p = 0.583 and p = 0.805, respectively). CwH exhibit reduced dynamic balance and an increased risk of falls compared to their healthy peers. However, dynamic balance appears to have no significant effect on quality of life in this group. These findings may guide the planning of rehabilitation programs for CwH."

    "title": "Structural Conformation and the Binding of Factor VIII R2159C (FVIII-Ise) Mutated in the C1 Domain to Phospholipid.",
    "abstract": "We previously identified a factor (F)VIII molecular defect associated with an R2159C mutation in the C1 domain (named \"FVIII-Ise\") together with undetectable FVIII antigen (FVIII:Ag) levels measured by two-site sandwich ELISA using an anti-C2 domain alloantibody (alloAb). The patient had clinically mild hemophilia A, and his reduced FVIII:C correlated with FVIII:Ag measured by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with A2 and A2/B domain epitopes, suggesting that the R2159C mutation modified C2 domain antigenicity. To investigate functional and structural characteristics of the FVIII-R2159C mutant. ELISAs using a previous anti-C2 domain alloAb confirmed that the antigen level of recombinant FVIII-R2159C mutant prepared in BHK cells was 56% lower relative to wild-type (WT), consistent with our earlier reports. This anti-C2 domain alloAb competitively inhibited FVIII and anti-C1 domain mAb binding, indicating the involvement of specificity for C1 and C2 epitopes. The <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> for FVIII-R2159C with FIXa or FX in the tenase complex was similar to that of FVIII-WT. Thrombin- and FXa-catalyzed cleavage reactions of FVIII-R2159C were similar to those of WT. The <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> for FVIII-R2159C binding to phospholipids was moderately greater than for FVIII-WT, however, while there were no significant differences in von Willebrand factor binding. <i>In silico</i> molecular dynamic simulation analyses revealed subtle differences between FVIII-WT and FVIII-R2159C. The FVIII-R2159C mutation was not different from FVIII-WT in interactions with FIXa, FX, and thrombin, but reduced binding potential to phospholipids and to an anti-C1/C2 domain alloAb was evident apparently due to subtle changes in conformational structure."

    "title": "Adipose derived stromal vascular fraction cells therapy in hemophilic arthropathy: A case report.",
    "abstract": "Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is a heterogeneous collection of cells obtained from adipose tissue through lipoaspiration and is an alter-native intraarticular treatment option, especially in osteoarthritis (OA). The anti-inflammatory and extracellular tissue repair-stimulating properties of SVF increase its effectiveness in regeneration and repair mechanisms. One of the most common symptoms of hemophilia A and B is hemophilic arthropathy (HA). If HA is not adequately managed initially, patients may require major surgery, including total joint arthroplasty. In a 34-year-old male patient who was treated with intraarticular adipose-derived SVF with the diagnosis of hemophilia B and right grade 4 hemophilic knee arthrosis, clinical and radiological scores showed significant improvement in the 3rd month, 6th month, and 1st year controls after the procedure. Intraarticular adipose-derived SVF treatment should be kept in mind as an effective treatment option with minimal invasiveness and few side effects in HA that does not respond to conservative treatments."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorder that typically affects men. Women are usually asymptomatic carriers, and rarely presenting with severe or moderately severe phenotype. This study aims to describe a case of a 17-year-old girl with moderate HA, investigating the mechanisms of her condition and the genetic basis within her family. We conducted coagulation tests and bleeding assessments to evaluate her bleeding phenotype. Molecular genetic examinations, karyotype analysis, X-chromosome inactivation testing, and targeted bioinformatic analysis were used to identify potential genetic etiologies. The proband exhibited a severe bleeding phenotype and was found to be a heterozygous carrier of an intron 22 inversion (Inv22) with a normal chromosomal karyotype. No other hemostatic defects were identified through whole exome sequencing. The proband's mother and monozygotic twin sister are also Inv22 carriers, yet remain asymptomatic with normal FVIII activity. X-chromosome inactivation experiments revealed unbalanced inactivation in the proband, leading to the silencing of the healthy X copy. Notably, several novel X-linked gene mutations (SHROOM2, RPGR, VCX3B, GAGE, GCNA, ZNF280C, CT45A, and XK) were identified in the proband compared to her monozygotic twin sister, though their impact on X-chromosome inactivation remains unclear. Our findings suggest that the proband's bleeding phenotype results from unbalanced X-chromosome inactivation. This research marks the first analysis of X chromosome-related gene mutations among monozygotic twins who are carriers of hemophilia A, laying the groundwork for further investigations into the disorder's pathogenesis in women and highlighting the complexities in genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Spasticity affects up to 80% of individuals with cerebral palsy and can lead to pain and difficulties with performing activities of daily living. If left untreated, spasticity can progress to contracture and neuro-orthopedic deformities. Cryoneurolysis is an emerging and mini-invasive ultrasound-guided technique that causes secondary axonotmesis of peripheral nerves through the formation of an ice ball and may result in months to years of improved range of motion and reduced pain in patients with spasticity. However, the safety of cryoneurolysis has not yet been established in patients with an increased bleeding risk secondary to Hemophilia A. We present a case of cryoneurolysis for cerebral palsy-related spasticity in a 14-year-old male with hemophilia A who previously had minimal benefit from botulinum toxin for increased elbow and wrist flexor tone with contracture. Fifteen minutes prior to cryoneurolysis, an IV infusion of 2000 IU of recombinant antihemophilic factor (FVIII) was administered for bleeding prophylaxis. Targets were identified with ultrasound guidance and nerve stimulation and cryoneurolysis was performed without bleeding complications or adverse events. There was an immediate improvement in tone and range of motion that was maintained at 3- and 8-month follow-ups with reported increased left arm function. This case suggests that cryoneurolysis is an effective mini-invasive procedure for spasticity that improves tone and range of motion and is safe for use in patients with Hemophilia A who receive adequate Factor VIII prophylaxis."

    "abstract": "The production of inhibitors is a serious complication that can arise during coagulation factor replacement therapy for hemophilia A (HA). The primary therapeutic strategy to eliminate inhibitors is immune tolerance induction (ITI), which is known to be an extremely challenging, prolonged, and costly treatment. With the widespread use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various treatment outcomes, there is potential for predicting ITI outcomes. This study aims to use RNA-seq to test differently expressed genes in different outcomes of ITI treatment for HA patients with high-titer inhibitor (HAI), to explore its prediction possibility. RNA-seq was employed to screen and compare the DEGs between patients in the Success group and those in the Failure group, based on ITI clinical outcomes. DEGs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and enrichment analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Thirteen analyzable HAI cases were collected, comprising seven in the Success group and six in the Failure group. Blood samples were taken before and after ITI. RNA-seq was applied to all samples to screen for expressed genes. In the Success group, a total of 4,967 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were differentially expressed between pre-ITI and post-ITI, with 2,865 being up-regulated and 2,102 down-regulated. In the Failure group, 515 mRNA transcripts were expressed either before or after ITI, showing up-regulation in 68.7% (354/515) and down-regulation in 31.3% (161/515). The increased expression of genes which related to immune system activation suggests a possibly favorable therapeutic outcome of ITI. Future studies should test with a larger cohort to validate these findings."

Acquired hemophilia A results from the immune system attacking factor VIII, typically occurring later in life. Factor V Leiden is a genetic mutation causing abnormal blood clot formation, primarily in veins. This mutation is inheritable and increases the risk of clotting. A combination of these conditions is extremely rare. Correct management of a patient with any bleeding disorder is imperative for a surgical case to prevent catastrophe.

    "abstract": "Bleeding assessment tools (BATs) are used by trained medical personnel for screening bleeding disorders on a one-to-one basis with patients; hence, they are time-consuming and limited in use for large-population screening. The aims of the study were to develop, validate, and demonstrate a Thai BAT mobile application (mBAT) for self-screening of bleeding disorders. mBAT was developed and validated using the paper-based Thai version of pediatric bleeding questionnaire (TPBQ). Then, mBAT was applied to 916 subjects from communities and hematology clinics. Those with scores of ≥3 consented to further investigation of bleeding disorders. mBAT was developed for Thai children using simple sentences, a video introduction, pictures, and auto-calculation. It showed a high correlation with the TPBQ: r = 0.96 and 0.97 in the PBQ and ISTH scoring systems, respectively (P<0.01). A score ≥3 was considered abnormal. The mBAT was applied to 916 subjects, with a mean (range) age of 10.5 (0.07-18.0) years. Most subjects (97.3%) were from the community, and the rest (2.7%) were from hematology clinics. The results showed 41 subjects had abnormal scores, and 35 (16 from the community and 19 from clinics) consented to diagnostic investigation. Eleven subjects (31.4%) were found to have bleeding disorders, including four with VWD, two each with hemophilia A and thrombocytopenia, and one each with factor VII deficiency, platelet dysfunction, and MYH9-related disorder. Thus, the prevalence rates of bleeding disorders in the subjects whose scores ≥3 from community and hematology clinics were 6.25% and 52.6%, respectively. In conclusions, the mBAT had a high correlation with the TPBQ. As a self-screening tool, it could enhance the diagnosis of bleeding disorders."

Previous studies have reported differences in FVIII inhibitor kinetics (type I or type II) in AHA compared to severe haemophilia A. To characterise inhibitor kinetics in AHA and evaluate the proportions displaying type I, II or indeterminate kinetics. Single-centre retrospective study of inhibitor kinetics in adults with AHA. Type I kinetics were defined as linear FVIII inhibition with ≥ 97% FVIII inactivation. Type II kinetics were defined as non-linear kinetics and inability to completely neutralise FVIII. Inhibitor titres were calculated using two methods outlined by the International Council for Standardisation in Haematology. Baseline samples from 34 patients were included. Fifteen samples (44.1%) exhibited type I kinetics, 16 samples (47.1%) exhibited type II kinetics and 3 (8.8%) were indeterminate. Plateau mean residual FVIII:C was higher for inhibitors displaying type II compared to type I kinetics (18.6 vs. 2.9 IU/dL, p < 0.0001). Non-linear regression using a dose-response curve without categorisation for kinetics type yielded a poor fit (R<sup>2</sup> = 38%), which improved with refitting using categories of type I or II kinetics that explained 87% and 85% of the variability. The median difference in inhibitor titre between the two reporting methods was 5% and 15% in the type I and II kinetics groups, respectively. FVIII autoantibodies demonstrate either type I or type II kinetics. Greater discrepancy in reported inhibitor titres depending on the method used is seen for inhibitors with type II kinetics."

However, interindividual differences affect the half-life and clearance of rFVIII products. The myPKFiT is a web-based medical-device software program for population pharmacokinetic (PK) simulation of FVIII products to guide accurate FVIII doses and dosing intervals. In this Japanese multicenter observational study, the efficacy of regimen adjustment using myPKFiT was examined. Male patients with hemophilia A undergoing personalized treatment with myPKFiT using either octocog alfa or rurioctocog alfa pegol were included. Patients were aged <18 years. Primary endpoint was annualized bleeding rate (ABR). Secondary endpoints were ABR by type of bleeding, rFVIII product consumption, physical activity level, quality of life, and frequency of rFVIII administrations. Results are presented descriptively; however, for exploratory analysis, data before and after regimen adjustment were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Seven patients aged 3-17 years (median age 13 years) participated in the study. Mean ABR for all bleeds decreased by 0.86 after PK-guided regimen adjustment. Four patients showed zero ABR before and after regimen adjustment using myPKFiT. No significant differences were noted in the consumption of rFVIII products. However, mean rFVIII consumption decreased in two patients after PK-guided regimen adjustment. Three patients increased physical activity and, according to the treatment based on the PK-guided regimen adjustment, this resulted in no increased bleeding. The results from this study in a small number of patients suggest that PK-guided regimen adjustment with myPKFiT may support optimization of the individual prophylactic administration of the FVIII products octocog alfa and rurioctocog alfa pegol.

    "abstract": "Low-dose (LD) or intermediate-dose (MD) immune tolerance induction (ITI) is effective in children with severe hemophilia A (SHA) with high-titer inhibitors (HTIs) and is attractive in countries with economic constraints. However, high-quality evidence of their use is lacking. This was a multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy, safety, and medication cost between LD-ITI and MD-ITI for SHA-HTI children. Children with SHA aged <8 years with historical/pre-ITI inhibitor titer 5 to 200 Bethesda Units/mL in 3 centers were randomized 1:1 to receive LD-ITI (recombinant factor VIII [rFVIII] 50 IU/kg every other day) or MD-ITI (rFVIII 100 IU/kg/d) from January 2022 to June 2024 (ChiCTR2200056603, https://www.chictr.org.cn). Thirty-one patients (16 in MD-ITI and 15 in LD-ITI) were enrolled and followed for >24 months (median, 26.9; range, 24.0-29.5 months). The 2 groups had similar baseline clinical characteristics and similar success rates (93.8% [MD-ITI] vs 86.7% [LD-ITI]). Compared with LD-ITI, MD-ITI patients took a shorter median time to success (4.2 months vs 10.1 months) and partial success (2.7 months vs 6.6 months) and had lower mean rates for all bleeding (0.38/mo vs 1.40/mo) and joint bleeding (0.11/mo vs 0.83/mo). Between the 2 groups, although the MD-ITI group had higher rFVIII consumption (12,775 vs 7680 IU/kg), their total medication costs to success were similar (3626.49 vs 3240.38 US$/kg). For SHA-HTI children, the success rate and cost for MD-ITI and LD-ITI regimens were similar. MD-ITI regimen would be a priority for regions with economic constraints, considering the shorter time to success, better bleeding control, and no increase in medication cost."

    "abstract": "Congenital hemophilia A (HA) disease severity has traditionally been categorized according to intrinsic factor (F)VIII levels, with <1% of normal indicating severe HA, 1% to 5% moderate HA, and 6% to 40% mild HA. However, mounting evidence illustrates considerable variability in bleeding phenotype regardless of FVIII level. Despite treatment advances, people with moderate or mild HA may be neglected, as treatment guidelines and established norms focus on FVIII levels, and many clinical trials do not include people with FVIII > 1%. Data from the HAVEN 6 trial demonstrated that people with moderate or mild HA, for whom prophylaxis was warranted by the treating physician's judgment, experienced a clear clinical benefit from receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. A shift in treatment paradigms to incorporate clinical phenotypes alongside FVIII levels should be encouraged. This change in practice would allow treaters to extend health equity to people with moderate or mild HA."

    "title": "Gene therapy in hemophilia: the dawn of a new era.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are hereditary bleeding disorders associated with the X chromosome, stemming from genetic defects in the coding of coagulation factor (F)VIII or FIX protein, leading to partial or complete deficiency. In the absence of effective prophylaxis, these deficiencies can result in irreversible joint damage, known as hemophilic arthropathy, and subsequent disability. Despite advancements in hemophilia treatment, individuals with severe forms of the disease continue to face a high risk of bleeding, particularly in instances of trauma or major surgical procedures. In such scenarios, it remains imperative to administer replacement or bypassing drugs, especially when inhibitors are present. Within this context, gene therapy emerges as a compelling alternative, ensuring sustained expression of the deficient factor at levels often surpassing current recommendations. Some studies report an effect lasting up to 8 years, contributing significantly to clinical improvement and enhancing the quality of life for patients. However, a comprehensive evaluation of this innovative therapy is essential, encompassing both its benefits and potential risks. It is crucial to undertake a multidisciplinary assessment, engage in thoughtful discussions with the patient, and closely monitor the therapy's effects and any eventual side effects of therapy. This approach aims to facilitate an informed and collaborative decision-making process, ultimately maximizing the benefits for each individual patient."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited condition that is characterized by a lack of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), which is needed for blood clotting. To produce recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) for treatment, innovative methods are required. This study presents a thorough examination of the genetic engineering and biotechnological methods that are essential for the production of this complex process. Multiple host cells, such as animal, microbial, and human cell lines, are examined. Cultivating genetically modified cells enables the production of rFVIII, with further changes after protein synthesis, such as glycosylation, taking place in eukaryotic cells to guarantee correct folding. The extraction and purification of rFVIII require advanced methods, including affinity chromatography, to improve the purity of the protein. The purified protein undergoes rigorous quality control, which includes Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) analysis, to assess its identity, purity, and functioning. The scalability of this approach allows for the synthesis of significant amounts of rFVIII for therapeutic purposes. Optimization strategies include modifying B-domain-deleted (BDD) FVIII, including introns in FVIII complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences to boost synthesis and storage, and making changes to chaperone-binding areas to optimize protein release. Furthermore, the search for a modified form of FVIII that has a longer duration of action in the body shows potential for enhancing the effectiveness of synthetic FVIII and progressing the treatment of hemophilia A. Future research should focus on improving the treatment of hemophilia A by developing a variant of FVIII that has increased stability and reduced immunogenicity."

The aims of this study were to evaluate joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hemophilia; determine which patient groups to focus on and whether there are any neglected patient groups. This was a single-center, cross-sectional study. Patients were evaluated by ultrasonography (Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound [HEAD-US]), physical examination (Hemophilia Joint Health Score version 2.1 [HJHS-2.1]), and HRQoL scales (EQ-5D/EQ-VAS and Haemo-QoL). Thirty-nine patients with regular follow-up were evaluated for a total of 234 joints. When hemophilia severity was compared with the HEAD-US and HJHS-2.1, a significant difference was found between severe and non-severe hemophilia. On the other hand, when patients' total HEAD-US scores were compared with total HJHS-2.1 scores, no statistically significant correlations were found; only a statistically significant but negligible correlation was detected when HEAD-US and HJHS-2.1 scores were examined at joint level. No significant difference was found when mild, moderate or severe hemophilia were compared with the HRQoL scores. Also, HEAD-US scores and HRQoL scores were not correlated, showing that the HRQoL score did not change whether the patient has arthropathy or not. Despite recent advances in treatment options for hemophilia, arthropathy in patients with severe hemophilia remains challenging. For the follow-up of pediatric hemophilia, the HEAD-US and HJHS should be used together because their correlation was weak. Although patients with severe hemophilia are at higher risk in terms of arthropathy, patients with mild/moderate hemophilia should not be ignored because their HRQoL is not different from that of severe hemophilia."

    "title": "Integrating biomarkers for hemostatic disorders into computational models of blood clot formation: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "In the pursuit of personalized medicine, there is a growing demand for computational models with parameters that are easily obtainable to accelerate the development of potential solutions. Blood tests, owing to their affordability, accessibility, and routine use in healthcare, offer valuable biomarkers for assessing hemostatic balance in thrombotic and bleeding disorders. Incorporating these biomarkers into computational models of blood coagulation is crucial for creating patient-specific models, which allow for the analysis of the influence of these biomarkers on clot formation. This systematic review aims to examine how clinically relevant biomarkers are integrated into computational models of blood clot formation, thereby advancing discussions on integration methodologies, identifying current gaps, and recommending future research directions. A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol, focusing on ten clinically significant biomarkers associated with hemostatic disorders: D-dimer, fibrinogen, Von Willebrand factor, factor Ⅷ, P-selectin, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin Ⅲ, protein C, and protein S. By utilizing this set of biomarkers, this review underscores their integration into computational models and emphasizes their integration in the context of venous thromboembolism and hemophilia. Eligibility criteria included mathematical models of thrombin generation, blood clotting, or fibrin formation under flow, incorporating at least one of these biomarkers. A total of 53 articles were included in this review. Results indicate that commonly used biomarkers such as D-dimer, PT, and APTT are rarely and superficially integrated into computational blood coagulation models. Additionally, the kinetic parameters governing the dynamics of blood clot formation demonstrated significant variability across studies, with discrepancies of up to 1, 000-fold. This review highlights a critical gap in the availability of computational models based on phenomenological or first-principles approaches that effectively incorporate affordable and routinely used clinical test results for predicting blood coagulation. This hinders the development of practical tools for clinical application, as current mathematical models often fail to consider precise, patient-specific values. This limitation is especially pronounced in patients with conditions such as hemophilia, protein C and S deficiencies, or antithrombin deficiency. Addressing these challenges by developing patient-specific models that account for kinetic variability is crucial for advancing personalized medicine in the field of hemostasis."

    "abstract": "Clinical research has offered many definitions and fragmented perspectives of joint morbidity in haemophilia. As joint damage, pain and mobility impairment can be present without clinical record of persistent bleeding, a person-centric joint morbidity characterisation remained a priority for the haemophilia community, giving rise to the 'problem joint' concept. As diagnosing and managing joint morbidity is critical, the aim of this study was to analyse the holistic burden of problem joints in people with moderate or severe haemophilia A (HA). Data from the 'Cost of Haemophilia in Europe: a Socioeconomic Survey' (CHESS) cross-sectional studies were used. CHESS-Paediatrics included male paediatric patients (≤ 17 years) with congenital moderate or severe haemophilia, while CHESS II included adult males (≥ 18 years) of any severity. Both studies sought to collect detailed information on the clinical, economic and humanistic burden of haemophilia. Demographics, clinical outcomes, treatment regimen, adherence, physical activity, healthcare resource use and number of problem joints were evaluated and described by HA severity and number of problem joints (none, 1, ≥ 2). In total, 1171 people with non-inhibitor moderate or severe HA from CHESS-Paediatrics (n = 703) and CHESS II (n = 468) were included in this analysis. Presence of problem joints was more prevalent among CHESS II participants (44%) than in CHESS-Paediatrics (14%). Around two-thirds (67%) of CHESS-Paediatrics and 39% of CHESS II participants received prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy. The presence of chronic pain was greater in severe HA with ' ≥ 2' problem joints in both cohorts. Clinical symptoms and bleed-related hospitalizations were more prevalent in the presence of problem joints regardless of HA severity in both cohorts. This analysis of the CHESS population studies has expanded on previous work by examining the relevance of the problem joint measure of haemophilic morbidity and its associated burden. Adverse clinical symptoms and increased bleed-related hospitalizations were observed in the presence of problem joints in both children/adolescents and adults across HA severities. Use of person-centric characterizations of joint morbidity may improve analysis of long-term outcomes and lead to improvements in future haemophilia care."

Intermediate-dose tertiary prophylaxis with rhFVIII can improve quality of life but not relieve anxiety and depression in adults with severe/moderate hemophilia A. Better functional independence correlates with improved quality of life. Gait and age also influence the quality of life to some extent. We need to undertake anxiety and depression screening and provide psychological treatment when necessary."

    "title": "Tolerance to factor VIII in the era of nonfactor therapies: immunologic perspectives and a systematic review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Persons with hemophilia A lack clotting factor (F)VIII (FVIII) due to a genetic mutation in the F8 gene. The administration of FVIII concentrate leads to the development of neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies (inhibitors) in about 30% of children with severe hemophilia A. The other 70% of children do not mount a detectable antibody response, suggesting that they may have developed tolerance toward FVIII. Our knowledge on the underlying immunologic mechanisms that determine formation of inhibitors or apparent tolerance to FVIII is limited. Up to recently, FVIII concentrates were regularly used as prophylaxis. In the last years, nonfactor therapy for prophylaxis is increasingly used, in which case FVIII concentrate administration is limited to treatment for bleeding or perioperative hemostasis. As nonfactor therapy is very effective in the prevention of bleeds, patients may not be exposed to the deficient FVIII protein for periods up to a year or longer. Thus, while in the past persons with severe hemophilia were frequently exposed to the deficient antigen, exposure is now reduced to incidental treatment moments. It is currently not known how this will affect the tolerance for FVIII. In this review, we will discuss tolerance to FVIII from a clinical, immunologic, and epidemiologic perspective. We aimed to provide an outlook on the effect of reduced FVIII exposure on tolerance for FVIII in persons with hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, an adeno-associated virus vector that transfers a human factor (F)VIII (FVIII) coding sequence to hepatocytes, provides bleeding protection for people with severe hemophilia A. Determine the efficacy and safety of valoctocogene roxaparvovec with concomitant prophylactic glucocorticoids in the open-label, single-arm, phase 3b GENEr8-3 trial. Participants with severe hemophilia A who were using hemophilia A prophylaxis received one 6 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg infusion of valoctocogene roxaparvovec concomitantly with daily prophylactic glucocorticoids (40 mg prednisolone equivalent/d weeks 0-8; taper to 5 mg/d weeks 9-19). The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in FVIII activity (chromogenic substrate assay) at week 52. Secondary efficacy endpoints included annualized rate of FVIII use and annualized bleeding rate for treated bleeds. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs). Analysis populations were intent-to-treat (ITT; received valoctocogene roxaparvovec) for safety analyses and modified ITT (≥52 FVIII infusions in the year before dosing) for efficacy analyses. Overall, 22 participants with severe hemophilia A received valoctocogene roxaparvovec. In the modified ITT population (n = 21), mean week 52 FVIII activity increased from baseline (imputed as 1 IU/dL) to 16.1 IU/dL (SD, 22.4; P = .0057); posthemophilia A prophylaxis, mean treated annualized bleeding rate and mean annualized FVIII use decreased 67.1% and 91.6% from baseline, respectively (P < .05). The most common AE was alanine aminotransferase elevation (20/22 participants). Glucocorticoid-related AEs occurred in 19 of 22 participants. No participants discontinued the study. Based on cross-trial comparisons, prophylactic glucocorticoids do not confer safety or efficacy benefits compared with reactive glucocorticoid regimens."

This review introduces AI, with a specific focus on machine learning (ML) methods, and examines its applications in the field of coagulation genetics over the past decade. We observed a significant increase in AI-related publications, with a focus on hemophilia A and B. ML approaches have shown promise in predicting the functional impact of genetic variants and establishing genotype-phenotype correlations, exemplified by tools like \"Hema-Class\" for factor VIII variants. However, some challenges remain, including the need to expand variant selection beyond missense mutations (which is now the standard of most studies). For the future, the integration of AI in calling, detecting, and interpreting genetic variants can significantly improve our ability to process large-scale genomic data. In this frame, we discuss various AI/ML-based tools for genetic variant detection and interpretation, highlighting their strengths and limitations. As the field evolves, the synergistic application of multiple AI models, coupled with rigorous validation strategies, will be crucial in advancing our understanding of coagulation disorders and for personalizing treatment approaches."

However, no current laboratory method accurately measures FVIII levels in the presence of emicizumab. To test whether the bovine chromogenic FVIII assay, specifically calibrated for efanesoctocog, could provide an accurate assessment of efanesoctocog activity. Seven centers across 5 countries received 12 plasma samples to measure in triplicate using 2 calibration methods across 3 independent days. Samples (n = 6) contained either only efanesoctocog (FVIII activity [FVIII:C]= 5 to 150 IU/dL), or efanesoctocog (FVIII:C = 5 to 150 IU/dL) in combination with emicizumab (50 μg/mL; n = 5). One sample contained efanesoctocog (FVIII:C = 50 IU/dL) and a high dose of emicizumab (80 μg/mL); another sample contained efanesoctocog (FVIII:C = 50 IU/dL) with a low dose of emicizumab (20 μg/mL). Each center used its own analyzers, along with their usual reagents. Chromogenic assay (CSA) calibrated with standard calibrators highly overestimates FVIII:C. However, specific calibration with efanesoctocog enabled accurate measurement of FVIII:C, with low inter- and intra-laboratory variability, and no interference from emicizumab. All CSA reagents used in the study demonstrated low variability across different laboratories (interlaboratory coefficient of variation ranges between 9% and 20%). Specific calibration of the FVIII CSA using efanesoctocog and bovine reagents allows for accurate measurement of FVIII:C in patients receiving efanesoctocog, even in the presence of emicizumab."

    "abstract": "This perspective discusses the critical role of laboratory assessments in assessing factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors. These are auto- and alloantibodies that can develop against both endogenous and exogenous FVIII, respectively. Assessment for inhibitors represents a key part of the management of both congenital hemophilia A (CHA), an inherited deficiency, and acquired hemophilia A (AHA), an autoimmune condition. Both conditions pose significant bleeding risks, necessitating careful monitoring of FVIII levels and inhibitor presence and level. Laboratory assays, particularly the Bethesda assay, are essential for detecting these inhibitors and assessing their levels. The complexities of FVIII inhibitor kinetics may pose challenges to interpretation of assay results, such that even normal FVIII levels do not always exclude inhibitor presence. Clinical practice guidelines recommend ongoing monitoring of AHA/CHA patients until inhibitors are no longer detectable. Overall, timely laboratory evaluations are essential to optimizing treatment strategies for patients with hemophilia, aiming to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. We summarize our approach to the laboratory assessment of FVIII inhibitors, as reflecting our perspective and as informed by local practice."

    "abstract": "Liver transplantation is an important treatment option for liver cirrhosis in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. In Japan, the limited number of deceased donors may force the selection of living donor liver transplantation. Appropriate graft selection is the key to success. The patient, a 66-year-old male with hemophilia A, acquired HIV and HCV through blood transfusions. He had a multidrug-resistant HIV strain, requiring frequent changes in antiretroviral therapy. Although his HCV cleared spontaneously, liver fibrosis progressed. With a Child-Pugh score of 9 and a MELD score of 13, liver transplantation was considered. His child became the living donor. A factor VIII concentrate test was performed preoperatively, and his HIV treatment was adjusted to avoid drug interactions. The chosen graft was a posterior segment (graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.8), and surgery lasted 787 min with a blood loss of 7046 g. Factor VIII concentrate was stopped on the second postoperative day as activity increased. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 47. This is the first reported living donor liver transplantation using a posterior segment graft in a hemophilia patient coinfected with HIV and HCV. Liver transplantation can be safely performed by formulating a preoperative coagulation factor supplementation protocol."

The comprehensive search strategy for this systematic review was conducted across five databases, namely, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. The search was aimed at identifying relevant literature published from January 2000 up to February 2024. Eligible studies included those with various designs, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies. Data extraction was carried out systematically, and relevant information on study characteristics, interventions, treatment protocols, local measures, complications, and outcomes was collected. <b>Results</b>: The systematic review included a total of five studies, encompassing participants ranging from ages of 2 to 18 years. These studies varied in their scope, with some focusing on hemophilia A with inhibitors while others addressed broader inherited bleeding disorders. The interventions examined included various prophylactic and treatment measures such as Emicizumab, recombinant factor VIIa, and local hemostatic measures. The study outcomes primarily assessed the efficacy of these interventions in preventing postoperative bleeding and improving quality of life. Emicizumab has significantly shifted the treatment paradigm for children with inherited bleeding disorders and inhibitors. This prophylactic treatment has been associated with a marked reduction in the frequency of bleeding episodes, fewer hospital admissions for bleeding management, and enhanced participation in daily activities. <b>Conclusions</b>: This review highlights gaps in the management of dental care in children with inherited bleeding disorders and inhibitors. It underscores the need for standardized protocols that integrate new prophylactic treatments such as Emicizumab. Our findings suggest that adopting updated protocols can significantly reduce bleeding complications during dental procedures."

The role of coagulation factors and inflammatory cytokines on bone metabolism, particularly on osteoblast function, is of increasing interest. However, significant inter-species differences in bone remodeling raise concerns about the translatability of findings from murine models to human systems. This study aims to investigate the effects of human coagulation factors and cytokines on bone formation, focusing on inter-species differences in the cell viability and mineralization of murine and human osteoblasts. <b>Methods</b>: Murine MC3T3-E1 and human SaOs-2 osteoblasts were cultured in osteoblast differentiation medium supplemented with various coagulation factors (FVIII, vWF, vWF-FVIII, FIX, FX, thrombin, and FVIII-thrombin) or cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α). Cell viability was assessed at both two-week and three-week time points using the CCK-8 assay, and mineralization was evaluated via Alizarin red S staining. <b>Results:</b> Coagulation factors significantly enhanced cell viability in human osteoblasts but had no effects on the murine counterpart. FX inhibited mineralization in human cells, while murine cells showed no significant changes. TNF-α stimulated mineralization in murine osteoblasts but inhibited it in human cells, highlighting species-specific responses to inflammatory cytokines. Similar trends in response patterns were observed at two and three weeks, with greater consistency at the later time point. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings reveal critical inter-species differences in osteoblast responses to coagulation factors and cytokines, raising questions about the validity of using murine models to study human bone metabolism. Future research must account for these differences to ensure that preclinical models accurately reflect human pathophysiology, particularly in the context of hemophilia A."

Many variants within F8 remain variants of uncertain significance (VUS) or are under-explored as to their connections to phenotypic outcomes. We assessed data on F8 expression while screening the UniProt, ClinVar, Geno2MP, and gnomAD databases for F8 missense variants; these collectively represent the sequencing of more than a million individuals. For the two F8 isoforms coding for different protein lengths (2351 and 216 amino acids), we observed noncoding variants influencing expression which are also associated with thrombosis risk, with uncertainty as to differences in females and males. Variant analysis identified a severe stratification of potential annotation issues for missense variants in subjects of non-European ancestry, suggesting a need for further defining the genetics of diverse populations. Additionally, few heterozygous female carriers of known pathogenic variants have sufficiently confident phenotyping data, leaving researchers unable to determine subtle, less defined phenotypes. Using structure movement correlations to known pathogenic variants for the VUS, we determined seven clusters of likely pathogenic variants based on screening work. This work highlights the need to define missense variants, especially those for VUS and from subjects of non-European ancestry, as well as the roles of these variants in women's physiology."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is caused by mutations in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Genome editing in conjunction with patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a promising cell therapy strategy, as it replaces dysfunctional proteins resulting from genetic mutations with normal proteins. However, the low expression level and short half-life of FVIII still remain significant limiting factors in the efficacy of these approaches in HA. Here, we constructed a functionally enhanced FVIII variant, F309S/E1984V-mutated B domain-deleted (BDD)-FVIII (FE-FVIII), with increased activity and stability. We inserted FE-FVIII with a human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1α) promoter into the AAVS1 locus of HA patient-derived iPSCs via CRISPR/Cas9 (D10A) nickase to ensure expression in any cell type. FE-FVIII was expressed not only in undifferentiated FE-FVIII-inserted (FE-KI) iPSCs but also in endothelial cells (ECs) differentiated from them in vitro. Compared with mice transplanted with wild-type BDD-FVIII-containing ECs, immunocompetent HA mice intravenously transplanted with FE-KI ECs presented a 2.12-fold increase in FVIII activity in the blood and an approximately 20% greater survival rate after hemorrhagic tail injury. For sustained efficacy, FE-KI ECs were subcutaneously transplanted into immunodeficient HA mice, resulting in amelioration of the hemophilia phenotype for more than 3 months. This strategy can improve FVIII function and may provide a universal therapeutic approach for treating HA."

    "abstract": "Background and objective Hemophilia A (HA) is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a lack of factor VIII (FVIII) and is associated with frequent bleeding and joint damage. Traditional intravenous treatments for this condition are cumbersome and can lead to complications. Emicizumab, a bispecific monoclonal antibody, offers a promising subcutaneous alternative with potential safety and efficacy-related benefits. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of emicizumab prophylaxis on bleeding rates, joint health, functional activity, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with congenital HA. Methods A noninterventional, prospective observational study was conducted at the Assam Medical College, a tertiary care center in northeastern India, involving 40 patients with HA (PwHA), who were either on FVIII therapy or newly on emicizumab. Emicizumab was given subcutaneously at 3 mg/kg weekly for the first month, followed by 6 mg/kg every four weeks. Endpoints included changes in annual bleeding rate (ABR), Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia (FISH), and QoL via European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 5-Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 24 weeks. Results At 24 weeks, HJHS improved from 12.8 to 4.8 (p<0.001), FISH from 27.5 to 30.6 (p<0.001), and ABR decreased from 11.36 to 0.195. Quality of life scores also improved (EQ-5D-5L index from 0.79 to 0.96, VAS from 72.18 to 92.75, both p<0.001). All 30 patients with target joints had resolved bleeds, and adherence to emicizumab was 100%. Conclusions Based on our findings, emicizumab significantly reduces bleeding, enhances joint health, and improves the quality of life in PwHA. It is associated with high adherence, suggesting its feasibility as a treatment, especially in resource-limited settings. However, long-term studies are needed to validate these results."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical manifestations, laboratory characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of 25 patients diagnosed with AHA who were admitted to the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Among all patients, 11 cases had secondary factors, including 5 cases of autoimmune diseases, 3 cases of pregnancy-related disease, 1 case of pemphigoid, 1 case of Graves' disease, and 1 case of monoclonal gammaglobulinemia of unknown significance (MGUS). The bleeding sites include the skin, mucous membrane, muscle, joint cavity and brain tissue. Twenty-three patients were treated with prednisone combined with cyclophosphamide (CP regimen), one patient with rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide because of femoral head necrosis, and one case with rituximab monotherapy because of gastrointestinal bleeding after prednisone treatment. Among them, 23 cases achieved complete remission (CR), 2 cases were partial remission (PR), and 8 cases relapsed after CR. All of 10 patients including 2 cases with PR and 8 relapsed cases after CR were treated with rituximab. At last, 8 patients achieved CR, and 2 patients (both were patients with recurrence after first CR) achieved PR. These two patients achieving PR were treated with low-dose rituximab combined with bortezomib (RB regimen). One patient reached CR after 4 cycles and the other reached CR after 6 cycles of RB regimen. After CR, 4 of the 10 patients treated with rituximab received maintenance therapy with rituximab monotherapy for 1.5 to 2 years, in which, none of them relapsed. Among the 6 patients who did not receive maintenance therapy, 4 patients relapsed after CR, and the median time to relapse was 15 months. Eight patients treated with CP regimen developed common infections, and two patients treated with rituximab developed severe pneumonia. All 25 patients survived until the end of follow-up. Skin ecchymosis, mucous hemorrhage and muscle hematoma are the most common hemorrhagic manifestations in AHA, and joint hemorrhage and cerebral hemorrhage can also occur. CP regimen is the preferred option of first-line therapy for AHA. Rituximab can be used for patients with steroid contraindication or who failed to respond to the above therapy or relapsed after effective treatment, and maintenance therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence. Meanwhile, close attention should be paid to the occurrence of infection events during rituximab treatment. Rituximab in combination with bortezomib can also be used in patients with refractory or relapsing AHA."

    "title": "Invasive Intracranial Electroencephalography Monitoring in the Child with a Bleeding Disorder: Challenges and Considerations.",
    "abstract": "Hereditary bleeding disorders stem from the absence or insufficient levels of particular clotting proteins, essential for facilitating coagulation in the clotting cascade. Among the most prevalent are hemophilia A (deficiency of factor VIII), hemophilia B (deficiency of factor IX), and von Willebrand disease (VWD). Management of pharmacoresistant epilepsy is more difficult in a patient with bleeding disorder due to increased risk of bleeding during surgery. While patients who have both a bleeding disorder and epilepsy are rare, reporting on the management of these patients who may require intracranial monitoring for pharmacoresistant epilepsy offers valuable insights into the challenges and considerations necessary for safely navigating the complex intersection of bleeding risk and seizure control. Two patients with bleeding disorders (VWD and factor XI deficiency) underwent invasive intracranial monitoring for medical refractory epilepsy followed by epilepsy focus resection surgery. Both patients were found to have a bleeding disorder during their preoperative laboratory work. After abnormal laboratories were reported, both patients were referred to hematology for further evaluation and surgical planning. The first patient was a 10-year-old boy with medically refractory focal epilepsy who was found to have type IIM VWD. He underwent surgery for subdural grid placement followed by resection on postoperative day 6. He required wilate® (human von Willebrand factor/coagulation factor VIII complex) infusions from the day of surgery prior to surgery through postoperative day 14. The second case was a 2-year-old boy with a history of tuberous sclerosis and medically refractory epilepsy who was found to have factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) who required fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions throughout his hospitalization. He underwent surgery for sEEG followed by resection of the tubers. Both patients remained stable throughout their invasive monitoring and completed epilepsy resection surgeries without reported complications. Both patients achieved seizure freedom after surgery since their most recent follow-up of 1 month and 13 months. The two patients successfully underwent invasive neuromonitoring with subdural grids and sEEG for seizure focus identification followed by resective epilepsy surgery without bleeding complications while achieving seizure freedom. While epilepsy patients with a bleeding disorder should not automatically be denied surgery due to the increased risk of hemorrhage, it is crucial that any decision is based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation. This case report highlights the potential for future meta-analysis and further conversations regarding improved protocols for patients with bleeding disorders."

Addressing the challenge of sparse datasets in rare disease diagnostics, the study aims to enhance AI model robustness and accuracy through the integration of domain knowledge into the synthetic image generation process. The study employed two ultrasound datasets: a base dataset (Db) of knee recess distension images from non-hemophiliac patients and a target dataset (Dt) of hemarthrosis images from hemophiliac patients. The synthetic generation framework included a content generator (Gc) trained on Db and a context generator (Gs) to adapt these images to match Dt's context. This approach generated a synthetic target dataset (Ds), primed for AI training in rare disease research. The assessment of synthetic image generation involved expert evaluations, statistical analysis, and the use of domain-invariant perceptual distance and Fréchet inception distance for quality measurement. Expert evaluation revealed that images produced by our synthetic generation framework were comparable to real ones, with no significant difference in overall quality or anatomical accuracy. Additionally, the use of synthetic data in training convolutional neural networks demonstrated robustness in detecting hemarthrosis, especially with limited sample sizes. This study presents a novel approach for generating synthetic ultrasound images for rare disease detection, such as hemarthrosis in hemophiliac knees. By leveraging deep generative models and integrating domain knowledge, the proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of sparse datasets and enhances AI model training and robustness. The synthetic images produced are of high quality and contribute significantly to AI-driven diagnostics in rare diseases, highlighting the potential of synthetic data in medical imaging."

The study aims to assess all-cause and intracranial haemorrhage (ICH)-specific mortality of PWH in India. This is a retrospective, observational, multi-centric cohort study of 1020 haemophilia patients from three centres in India. The mortality data in the family was collected from personal interviews, and subsequently confirmed with the corresponding haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs). The demographic and clinical data, along with other comorbidities, were collected from the medical records. Among 170 reported deaths, 73 (42.9%) were caused by ICH, and 44 (25.9%) resulted from accidents or trauma. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was the third most common cause of death, accounting for 27 cases (15.9%). The average and median ages at death were 27.7 and 26 years, respectively. None of the deceased cases were receiving any prophylactic or immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy, and all had severe haemophilia. In addition, the prevalence of inhibitors and hypertension was significantly higher in deceased cases compared to that in the general haemophilia population (p < 0.05). Severity of haemophilia, episodic treatment, hypertension and inhibitors showed significant association with mortality. ICH continues to be the leading cause of death among haemophilia patients in the country.

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous emicizumab, a factor VIII (FVIII)-mimicking bispecific monoclonal antibody, can effectively prevent bleeds in haemophilia A (HA) patients with/without inhibitors; however, its standard-dose regimens are financially burdensome. Low-dose emicizumab prophylaxis may alternatively be applied to noninhibitor HA patients in resource-limited settings. During 2023, Thai patients with noninhibitor severe HA or moderate HA with severe bleeding phenotype (historical annualized bleeding rate [ABR] >5 bleeds/year before regular FVIII prophylaxis) who received low-/intermediate-dose FVIII secondary prophylaxis ≥8 months were enrolled. After the 4-day washout period, low-dose emicizumab prophylaxis (2.0-2.5 mg/kg every fortnight for two loading doses, then every 4 weeks) was implemented for 8 months. Pre-/post-emicizumab ABR, annualized joint bleeding rates (AJBR), haemophilia joint health scores (HJHS) and haemophilia-specific quality-of-life (QoL) scores were analysed. Emicizumab plasma levels on modified one-stage FVIII assays were also monitored. In 15 subjects, ABR (median of differences, -2 bleeds/year; interquartile range, -3 to 0; p = 0.002), but not AJBR (p = 0.07), were reduced after switching to low-dose emicizumab prophylaxis, although the pre-dose emicizumab plasma levels at the steady state, achieved since week 12, were modest (median monthly level, 8.4 µg/mL; interquartile range, 4.3-10.4). Concurrently, HJHS (p = 0.008) and QoL score (p < 0.001) were decreased, and 46.7% had zero bleeds while receiving low-dose emicizumab. Low-dose emicizumab, compared to low-/intermediate-dose FVIII secondary prophylaxis, meaningfully improves bleeding prevention, joint health and QoL in patients with noninhibitor severe HA or moderate HA with severe bleeding phenotype. This regimen potentially helps address previously unmet needs in HA care among low-to-middle-income countries. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT06155955."

Previous studies have reported measurement discrepancies in factor VIII activity between clot-based and chromogenic assays in approximately one-third of patients with non-severe hemophilia A. However, similar discrepancies in hemophilia B have been less extensively studied. This research compares clot-based and chromogenic assays in 33 patients with non-severe hemophilia B and investigates the mutations associated with these discrepancies. Citrate and EDTA samples were collected from 33 patients with non-severe hemophilia B at Iran's hemophilia comprehensive care center. Clinical information was also gathered. Both clot-based and chromogenic assays were performed on these patients. DNA was extracted from the EDTA samples for those with discrepancies in the test results, and PCR was conducted to sequence their genes to find mutations. Among 33 plasma samples from patients with non-severe hemophilia B, 7 showed a measurement discrepancy according to the definition of ISTH (<0.5, >2.0, or an absolute difference >10), which includes both reverse and classic types of discrepancies. In this study, mutations that previously did not show contradictory results now exhibit discrepancies. A difference in classification was observed in 21 % of the patients. The findings indicate that the impact of specific mutations varies depending on the assay conditions. In addition to mutations, other factors also play a role in this discrepancy. Both types of assays are essential for the accurate diagnosis and classification of hemophilia B."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive illness produced by a deficiency of coagulation factor VIII. This study aimed to evaluate serum vitamin D in hemophilic pediatric patients and its correlation with joint health and quality of life. <b>Methods</b>: This case-control study was performed on ninety children under the age of 18 years old and separated into two groups: study group of 45 children with hemophilia A and control group of 45 healthy children at an outpatient pediatric hematology clinic at the Beni-Suef University hospitals. <b>Results</b>: Serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in hemophilia A patients than in controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The level of serum vitamin D was deficient in 38 (84.4%), insufficient in 4 (8.8%) and sufficient in 3 (6.6%) in the study group while deficient in 8 (17.7%), insufficient in 16 (35.5%) and sufficient in 21 (46.6%) in the control group. Total hemophilia joint health score (HJHS) had a significant negative correlation with serum total calcium (R = -0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.038) and serum vitamin D level (R = -0.974, <i>p</i> < 0.001) while also positively correlated with alkaline phosphatase (R = 0.834, <i>p</i> < 0.001). A quality-of-life index that is specific to total hemophilia (Haemo-Qol/Haem-A-QoL) had a significant positive correlation with total hemophilia joint health score (HJHS) (R = 0.934, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and negatively correlated with serum vitamin D level (R = -0.924, <i>p</i>-value lower than 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (R = 0.842, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and severity of hemophilia (R = 0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions</b>: patients with hemophilia A had lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls. The severity of vitamin D deficiency is related positively to (HJHS) hemophilia and quality of life hemophilia cases according to Haemo-QoL."

We identified a female patient with moderate HA by pedigree tracking and genetic testing in a HA family involving consanguineous marriage. To investigate the clinical and laboratory data, as well as F8 genetic variant affecting members in her family. We constructed a detailed pedigree diagram and performed coagulation analyses, including factor VIII activity (FVIII:C), FVIII inhibitor, and von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF: Ag) on 20 family members. The genomic DNA of 11 members was screened for intron 1 and intron 22 inversions using long-distance real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Their F8 coding genes were sequenced with an automatic next-generation sequencing. Thirteen HA persons with hemophilia (12 males, one female) and 18 female carriers were identified in the family. VWF: Ag level was normal in all 13 persons with hemophilia and 7 carriers tested. The female HA patient had FVIII:C 1.9 IU/dL and was homozygous for F8:c.1918G > T:p.V640F. Genetic testing is conducive to the diagnosis of hemophilia carriers and persons with hemophilia. F8: c.1918G > T:p.V640F is the pathogenic HA variant in this family. In any hemophilia family, we need to pay more attention to female carriers and patients."

To explore the possibility of using reduced-dosage EMI in Chinese HA children. We conducted a retrospective study for HA children in our Comprehensive Care Center. Data were collected pre- and post-EMI treatment to evaluate bleeding rates. Laboratory analyses included factor VIII (FVIII)-like activity and EMI concentration measurements. Thirty-four HA children receiving EMI prophylaxis for a median (range) 24.5 (2.5-47.9) months by June 2023. Of these, 25 (73.5%) were under 3 years of age, 26 (76.5%) had severe hemophilia and 12 (35.3%) were minimally treated or previously untreated patients. Thirty-one (91.2%) of the 34 patients received reduced-dosage EMI for economic reasons. EMI concentration and FVIII-like activity measured showed a strong correlation. Overall, while on EMI, their annual treated bleeding rate (ATBR) and annual bleeding rate (ABR) decreased significantly (2-0) while their zero-bleeding rate (ZBR) increased significantly (11.5%-65.4%). After 6 months of EMI, there was no significant difference in ATBR and ABR among various maintenance dosages. However, ZBR was significantly lower in dosages under 4 mg/kg (<i>P</i> = 0.0156). Receiver operator characteristic curves suggested the following cutoff values for zero bleeding: EMI 4-weekly maintenance dosage 3.8 mg/kg, EMI concentration 48.1 μg/mL, and FVIII-like activity 15.4 IU/dL. We showed EMI effectively prevented bleeding even at reduced dosages. However, the bleeding risk may be higher with EMI 4-weekly maintenance dosage <3.8 mg/kg, EMI concentration <48.1 μg/mL, and FVIII-like activity <15.4 IU/dL for zero bleeding. It is important that dosage reduction be done rationally. Dosage tailoring is possible."

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the association of physical therapy, including therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, and physical agent modality, with HRQOL improvement in PWH. Databases PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched from inception until April 2024. This review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the HRQOL between the physical therapy and control groups. Relevant data and outcome values of included study were collected. Cochrane collaboration's tool and the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation approach were used for risk of bias (ROB) and evidence-level assessment, individually. The systematic review included eight RCTs that involved 298 male PWH. The meta-analysis for HRQOL improvement revealed a significant difference in favour of physical therapy (standardised mean difference [SMD] = .92; 95% confidence interval [CI]:.50-1.33; p < .001). Therapeutic exercise exhibited more benefits in HRQOL improvement than the control groups (SMD = 1.02; 95% CI:.49-1.55; p < .001). Physical therapy effectively improved HRQOL in PWH with better joint status (SMD = 1.74; 95% CI:.97-2.51; p < .001). Of the eight RCTs, six were rated as high ROB. The comparisons revealed a moderate certainty of evidence. Physical therapy, especially therapeutic exercise, effectively improved the HRQOL of PWH. Maintaining better joint status and timely physical therapy intervention is crucial for HRQOL improvements in PWH. Cautious interpretation is required due to evidence limitations."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder resulting from a deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII). To date, multiple gene therapies have entered clinical trials with the goal of providing durable haemostatic protection from a single dose. TAK 754 (BAX 888) is an investigational AAV8-based gene therapy containing a FVIII transgene. Reduction in CpG motifs was performed to reduce immunogenicity based on prior observations. Here, we describe the results of the first two cohorts treated with TAK 754. To report clinical and translational results of the TAK-754 phase 1/2 AAV gene therapy study for the treatment of haemophilia A. A phase 1/2 single arm open-label dose escalation study of TAK-754 was performed in participants with severe haemophilia A (NCT03370172). Participants were monitored for safety events, endogenous FVIII activity and bleeding rates. Glucocorticoids were implemented to preserve transgene expression. A transcriptomics analysis was performed to evaluate immunogenicity along with additional post-hoc analyses. Four participants were dosed in two cohorts. Infusion of TAK 754 was well-tolerated. All participants developed mild transient transaminase elevation and subsequent loss of FVIII expression within the first 12 months of treatment despite use of glucocorticoids. Transcriptomic analysis did not demonstrate significant changes in immunogenicity signals in peripheral blood. One serious adverse event of hypophosphatemia occurred in the second cohort without obvious risk factors. Sustained FVIII expression remains a challenge in haemophilia A AAV gene therapy trials. Mechanisms of transgene expression loss require further study as clinical studies enter long term follow-up periods."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is caused by coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency and increases bleeding risk during invasive procedures. To investigate FVIII concentrate use and bleeding outcomes for invasive procedures after valoctocogene roxaparvovec gene transfer. This manuscript presents post hoc analysis of the phase III GENEr8-1 trial. A post hoc analysis was performed for GENEr8-1, a global, single-arm, open-label, phase III trial that enrolled 134 adults with severe hemophilia A. FVIII activity and bleeding were evaluated after 2 years of follow-up. Invasive procedures were reviewed and categorized as major or minor. FVIII activity was measured with a chromogenic assay. Bleeding was self-reported by participants. Principal investigators completed questionnaires about perioperative management. In total, 111 invasive procedures were performed in 65 participants during GENEr8-1 as of the data cut. Procedures performed with FVIII treatment included 33 minor and 11 major procedures. The remaining 67 invasive procedures were minor and performed without FVIII treatment. When considering these 67 minor procedures, 43/46 investigators completing the questionnaires reported that the gene-therapy-derived FVIII activity was sufficient for the type of procedure. Minor procedures performed without FVIII treatment were associated with participants' higher mean endogenous FVIII activity (50.5 IU/dL) compared with major procedures (14.2 IU/dL) or minor procedures (16.4 IU/dL) performed with concomitant FVIII. Fourteen participants experienced 18 procedure-related bleeds (13 co-occurring with FVIII use). Participants who received FVIII treatment for procedure-related bleeds had numerically lower mean endogenous FVIII activity than those who did not receive FVIII treatment. Invasive procedures were safely performed in participants following treatment with valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The questionnaire responses from investigators generally suggest they used endogenous FVIII activity derived from valoctocogene roxaparvovec to inform clinical decisions in a manner comparable to exogenously administered FVIII, and more commonly prescribed supplementary FVIII concentrate in the peri-procedural period for participants with lower FVIII activity levels."

However, the precise molecular characteristics of clinical HA synovial samples remain to be defined. To gain insight into HA synovial tissue lesions, we utilized a metalloprotein strategy to compare the metal and protein spectra of HA with those of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We collected synovial samples from patients with HA, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Tissue metal and protein profiles were obtained by metallomics and proteomics, respectively. Finally, metalloproteomics strategies compared metal content, proteins, metalloproteins, and the life processes involved. Our metallomics analysis revealed an explicit increase in heavy metal content, particularly arsenic and mercury, in HA synovial samples. Through proteomics, we delineated specific metalloproteins and identified correlations between metals and pathways. These findings yield valuable insights into the pathogenesis of HA and offer potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by iron overload."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the ex vivo procoagulant effect of plasma-derived FVIII concentrates containing von Willebrand factor (pdFVIII/VWF) in samples from patients with severe HA without inhibitors on emicizumab prophylaxis. Samples from healthy controls (HC) and HA patients were drawn in sodium citrate plus corn trypsin inhibitor tubes and spiked with increasing concentrations of pdFVIII/VWF concentrates (10-400 IU/dL) (Fanhdi<sup>®</sup>/Alphanate<sup>®</sup>, Grifols), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC, 0.5 U/mL) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, 0.9 µg/mL). Global coagulation was measured by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) (clotting time [CT] and time to maximum clot formation velocity [MAXV-t]) and thrombin generation (TG) assay (thrombin peak [TP] and endogenous thrombin potential [ETP]). Samples from HA patients under emicizumab prophylaxis showed CT and MAXV-t values above HC levels, while TP and ETP were below HC levels. Ex vivo pdFVIII/VWF supplementation increased TP and ETP and shortened CT and MAXV-t dose-dependently. At 50 IU/dL (≈25 IU/kg), pdFVIII/VWF normalized clot formation and restored TG within HC normal range. The highest pdFVIII/VWF concentration (400 IU/dL) and rFVIIa did not result in an excessive procoagulant profile. However, aPCC induced ex vivo an excessive TG and markedly decreased ROTEM parameters (CT and MAXV-t). Coagulation parameters of both methods significantly correlated at baseline and with increasing concentrations of pdFVIII/VWF. High doses of pdFVIII/VWF concentrates, similar to those used for ITI, did not trigger a multiplying procoagulant effect to samples from HA patients on emicizumab prophylaxis, evidencing their low thrombotic risk in these patients."

An electronic database search was carried out using MEDLINE by PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases from January 2000 to August 2023 for case reports and case series published in English language. Case reports addressing the dental treatments for people with hemophilia A/hemophilia B were included. Cases of acquired hemophilia and cases of hemophilia who are inhibitor positive were excluded. There was a total of 286 articles that were identified of which 24 reports were included for the review. This included 20 case reports and four case series which addressed various dental treatment procedures performed on people with mild/moderate/severe hemophilia A or hemophilia B. A total of 28 patients were presented with a mean age of 20.4 years. The pre-treatment factor ranged from 200 to 2500 IU and the post-treatment factor range was 1000-3000 IU. There was a wide range of variation in the utilization of prophylactic factors for dental treatment procedures among people with hemophilia. This variation highlights the need for larger prospective clinical studies that address the rationale for using clotting factor concentrate and its impact on dental treatment outcomes for individuals with mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia A and B who have inhibitors face limited treatment options, because replacement therapy with clotting factor VIII or IX concentrates is ineffective, particularly for patients with high-titer inhibitors. Current mainstay therapies include immune tolerance induction (through frequent injections of clotting factor VIII or IX concentrates) to eradicate inhibitors and bypassing agents (such as recombinant activated clotting factor VII and activated prothrombin complex concentrates) for the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes. The use of these agents typically requires intravenous injections and sometimes hospitalization, which can be burdensome for patients. More recently, emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that mimics the function of activated clotting factor VIII, has demonstrated favorable efficacy for prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors, representing a promising new therapeutic strategy. Ongoing research aims to discover and develop easy-to-use nonfactor agents for managing hemophilia with inhibitors. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology of inhibitor development in hemophilia, outlines existing treatment options, and discusses advancements in novel therapeutic biologics, including a recombinant activated clotting factor VII variant (marzeptacog alfa), a new bispecific antibody (Mim8), antitissue factor pathway inhibitor antibodies (concizumab and marstacimab), and small interfering RNA targeting antithrombin (fitusiran). All of these agents are administered subcutaneously, with some offering the convenience of less frequent dosing (e.g., weekly or monthly). These potential drug candidates may provide significant benefits for the prophylaxis or treatment of bleeding disorders in patients with hemophilia and inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Coagulation is related to inflammation, but the key pathway, especially innate immune system and coagulation regulation, is not well understood and need to be further explored. Here, we demonstrated that neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), an innate immune inflammatory mediator, is upregulated in patients with thrombosis. Furthermore, it contributes to the initiation and amplification of coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombosis. This occurs by enhancing tissue factor expression on the cell surface, potentiating various clotting factors such as thrombin, kallikrein, factor XIa (FXIa), and FVIIa, promoting thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and inhibiting antithrombin. NGAL knockout led to strikingly prolonged clot reaction time and kinetic time in thromboelastography analysis, along with reduced thrombus generation angle and lower thrombus maximum amplitude, which were in line with remarkably prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. In several mouse hemostasis and thrombosis models, NGAL overexpression or IV administration promoted coagulation and hemostasis and aggravated thrombosis, whereas NGAL knockout or treatment with anti-NGAL monoclonal antibody significantly prolonged bleeding time and alleviated thrombus formation. Notably, NGAL knockout prolonged mouse tail bleeding time or artery occlusion time to over 40 or 60 minutes, respectively, resembling uncontrollable bleeding and clotting disorder seen in hemophilic mice. Furthermore, anti-NGAL monoclonal antibody treatment markedly reduced the formation of blood clots in inflammation-induced thrombosis models. Collectively, these findings unveil a previously unidentified role of NGAL in the processes of coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombosis, as well as the cross talk between innate immunity, inflammation, and coagulation. Thus, modulating NGAL levels could potentially help balance thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks."

We aimed to review model-based cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of haemophilia treatments, describe the sources of clinical evidence used by these CEAs, summarize the reported cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies, and assess the quality and risk of bias. We conducted a systematic literature review of model-based CEAs of haemophilia treatments by searching databases, the Tufts Medical Center CEA registry, and grey literature. We summarized and qualitatively synthesized the approaches and results of the included CEAs, without a meta-analysis due the diversity of the studies. 32 eligible studies were performed in 12 countries and reported 53 pairwise comparisons. Most studies analysed patients with haemophilia A rather than haemophilia B. Comparisons of prophylactic versus on-demand treatment indicated that prophylaxis may not be cost-effective, but there was no clear consensus. Emicizumab was generally cost-effective compared with clotting factor treatments and was always dominant for patients with inhibitors. Immune tolerance induction following a Malmö protocol was found to be cost-effective compared to bypassing agents, while there was no consensus for the other protocols. Gene therapies as well as treatment with extended half-life coagulation factors were always cost-effective over their comparators. Studies were highly heterogenous regarding their time horizons, model structures, the inclusion of bleeding-related mortality and quality-of-life impacts. This heterogeneity limited the comparability of the studies. 19 of the 32 included studies received industry funding, which may have biased their results. It was not possible to perform a quantitative synthesis of the results due to the heterogeneity of the underlying studies. Differences in results between previous CEAs may have been driven by heterogeneity in modelling approaches, clinical input data, and potential funding biases. A more consistent evidence base and modelling approach would enhance the comparability between CEAs."

Repeated RS was administered to 48 joints in 37 people with haemophilia (PwHs) diagnosed with chronic haemophilic synovitis. The frequency of bleeding episodes was meticulously recorded during the 6-month periods preceding and following each of the initial and subsequent RS procedures. Treatment failure was designated by the necessity for additional RS injections. The results for 48 joints were analysed. The mean bleeding frequency of the joints was 12.5 ± 7.29 (median 10) within the last 6 months in the pre-treatment evaluation and after the treatment, the mean bleeding frequency of the joints decreased to 2.25 ± 3.82 (median 0.5) for the first 6 months (p < 0.001) after the first RS. The mean survival of the first intervention was 40.52 ± 33.79 months (range, 1-124 months). In the second RS, the mean bleeding frequency of the joints was 10.29 ± 7.66 (median 8) within the last 6 months in the pre-treatment evaluation and after the treatment, and the mean bleeding frequency of the joints decreased to 0.93 ± 1.69 (median 0) for the first 6 months (p < 0.001). The survival rate of the second RS was 94% at 12 months, and 87% at 36 months.

PwHA received emicizumab during the four studies. In this analysis, pain was assessed using patient-reported responses to pain-specific questions from the Haem-A-QoL/Haemo-QoL-SF and the pain/discomfort dimension of the EQ-5D-5L. Responses were recorded at baseline and at regular intervals for up to 78 weeks following treatment initiation. Additional analyses evaluated the population with target joints at baseline, and the overall population stratified by age, factor (F)VIII inhibitor status and prior treatment. At the data cut-off, 504 PwHA had been treated across the four studies; 464 and 470 completed the Haem-A-QoL/Haemo-QoL-SF and the EQ-5D-5L, respectively. Improvements in pain-related QoL were observed by Week 13 of emicizumab prophylaxis and maintained through Week 78. In the overall population, responses of 'never/rarely' for 'my swellings hurt' and 'pain in joints' increased from 37.0% and 30.0% at baseline to 84.0% and 61.0% by Week 13, suggesting reductions in acute and chronic pain, respectively. Similar improvements were seen in the target joint population, and across all strata. Greater improvements were observed in younger versus older PwHA. Pain-related QoL improved with emicizumab prophylaxis regardless of target joints, age, FVIII inhibitor status or prior treatment. Haemophilia-specific assessments are needed to accurately capture and characterize pain in PwHA."

To assess the characteristics of people with AHA undergoing rehabilitation and/or with low activities of daily living (ADL) scores, thereby characterizing unmet needs in the management of AHA and informing treatment optimization. ORIHIME II, the largest epidemiological and treatment survey of AHA in Japan, is a descriptive, retrospective, observational study conducted using health claims data from April 2008 to October 2021. The primary outcome measures were rehabilitation practice and ADL scores on hospital admission and discharge; use of haemostatic agents and immunosuppressive therapy were also assessed. Overall, 427 patients in Japan were eligible for the study. Median (Q1-Q3) age was 78.0 (70.0-84.0) years; 264 patients (61.8%) were male. Median (Q1-Q3) time to start rehabilitation was 9 (4-21) and 14 (6-31) days for those with an admission ADL score of <85 and ≥85, respectively. Of the 427 patients, 249 underwent rehabilitation. The most common rehabilitation type was for disuse syndrome; haemostatic agents were more commonly used in patients undergoing earlier rehabilitation. The physical condition of the patient at hospitalization was associated with rehabilitation practice and the ability of the patient to perform day-to-day activities independently. Treatment strategies should be optimized to allow initiation of rehabilitation as early as possible in the course of AHA."

    "title": "The role of very low-dose prophylaxis in severe hemophilia patients.",
    "abstract": "Very low-dose prophylaxis of antihemophilic factor (AHF) in hemophilia involves administration of minimal amounts of clotting factor concentrates, typically below standard doses, to maintain baseline levels and reduce bleeding episodes. This method uses smaller, more frequent doses to balance bleeding prevention and cost-effectiveness. Close monitoring ensures adequate protection while avoiding overtreatment, offering a tailored, cost-effective approach to improve the quality of life (QoL) of the hemophiliacs. The study aims to study the bleeding risks in patients with severe hemophilia who are on very low-dose AHF prophylaxis. It also seeks to assess the annual consumption of AHF in the hemophiliacs. In addition, the research will determine the QoL in both groups using the social functioning (SF)-36 questionnaire,evaluate patient compliance with the prophylactic regimen, and check functional disability using the Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia (FISH). The patients selected for the study were diagnosed with cases of hemophilia and were planned for any surgical procedure. The study was a cross-sectional study lasting 12 months. Patients over 13 years were included and patients with any other bleeding tendencies were excluded from the study. The differences found in the study, were significant in terms of annual bleed rate (ABR), amount of AHF consumed, SF-36, and FISH scores. Our study found that very low-dose prophylaxis significantly reduced the ABR in hemophilia patients. Functional independence worsened in the control group but remained stable in the test group, which showed significant improvements in SF-36 domains. The test group had no inhibitor development and showed a decline in severe bleeds, proving the efficacy and superiority of low-dose prophylaxis over on-demand therapy."

Determine valoctocogene roxaparvovec durability, efficacy, and safety 4 years after treatment. In the phase 3 GENEr8-1 trial, 134 adult male persons with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors and previously using FVIII prophylaxis received a 6 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg infusion of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Efficacy endpoints included annualized bleed rate, annualized FVIII infusion rate, FVIII activity, and the Haemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults. Adverse events and immunosuppressant use were assessed. Change from baseline was assessed after participants discontinued prophylaxis (scheduled for week 4). Median follow-up was 214.3 weeks; 2 participants discontinued since the previous data cutoff. Declines from baseline in mean treated annualized bleed rate (-82.6%; <i>P</i> < .0001) and annualized FVIII infusion rate (-95.5%; <i>P</i> < .0001) were maintained from previous years in the primary analysis population of 112 participants who enrolled from a noninterventional study. During year 4, 81 of 110 rollover participants experienced 0 treated bleeds. Week 208 mean and median chromogenic FVIII activity were 16.1 IU/dL and 6.7 IU/dL, respectively, in 130 modified intention-to-treat participants. Seven participants resumed prophylaxis since the previous data cutoff. Mean change from baseline to week 208 in Haemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults Total Score (<i>P</i> < .0001) remained clinically meaningful for modified intention-to-treat participants. Alanine aminotransferase elevation was the most common adverse event during year 4 (56/131 participants); none required immunosuppressants. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec provides persistent FVIII expression, hemostatic control, and health-related quality of life improvements with no new safety signals."

    "abstract": "The treatment of indirect carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) poses a unique challenge. Currently, endovascular interventions remain the principal treatment option with high cure rates and acceptable safety profiles. The anatomical characteristics of individual cases determine the optimal vascular access routes (transvenous vs. transarterial), and the devices utilized to achieve therapeutic goals. We present a rare case of an indirect CCF in a 13-year-old patient with an anatomical variant of the ophthalmic artery and hemophilia. CCFs are infrequent in the pediatric population, and an association with a deep recurrent ophthalmic artery (DROA) and hemophilia presents a unique treatment challenge. The patient had been diagnosed with type A hemophilia in 2013. In November 2022, he had presented with insidious conjunctival hyperemia and developed gradual ocular proptosis. He had been referred to Ophthalmology in October 2023, with mild symptoms and no ocular bruit or visual acuity deterioration. Angio CT, angio MRI, and cerebral angiography at that time had shown an indirect CCF. The association of an anatomical variant with the indirect CCF led to adverse anatomy and failed transvenous/transarterial vascular access. Classic treatment options (coils, detachable balloons, and liquid embolic agents) are not feasible when selective microcatheterism is unsuccessful. A FRED flow diverter was placed in the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) as an off-label solution to adverse patient vascular anatomy. Successful device implantation resulted in the gradual resolution of the patient's ocular symptoms."

    "abstract": "Patients suffering from an inherited severe liver disorder require lifelong treatment to prevent premature death. Until recently, the only curative treatment option was liver transplantation, which requires lifelong immune suppression. Now, liver-directed gene therapy, which is a much less invasive procedure, has become a market-approved treatment for hemophilia A and B. This may pave the way for it to become the treatment of choice for many other recessive inherited liver disorders with loss-of-function mutations. Inherited liver disease with toxic-gain-of-function or intrinsic hepatocyte damage may require alternative applications, such as integrating vectors or genome editing technologies, that can provide permanent or specific modification of the genome. We present an overview of currently available gene therapy strategies, i.e., gene supplementation, gene editing, and gene repair investigated in preclinical and clinical studies to treat inherited severe liver disorders. The advantages and limitations of these gene therapy applications are discussed in relation to the underlying disease mechanism."

    "abstract": "Recently approved adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for liver monogenic diseases haemophilia A and B are exemplifying the success of liver-directed viral gene therapy. In parallel, additional gene therapy strategies are rapidly emerging to overcome some inherent AAV limitations, such as the non-persistence of the episomal transgene in the rapidly growing liver and immune response. Viral integrating vectors such as in vivo lentiviral gene therapy and non-viral vectors such as lipid nanoparticles encapsulating mRNA (LNP-mRNA) are rapidly being developed, currently at the preclinical and clinical stages, respectively. Macrophages are the first effector cells of the innate immune response triggered by gene therapy vectors. Macrophage uptake and activation following administration of viral gene therapy and LNP have been reported. In this study, we assessed the biodistribution of AAV, lentiviral, and LNP-mRNA gene therapy following the depletion of tissue macrophages by clodronate pre-treatment in neonatal and juvenile mice. Both neonatal and adult clodronate-treated mice showed a significant increase in lentiviral-transduced hepatocytes. In contrast, clodronate pre-treatment did not modify hepatocyte transduction mediated by hepatotropic AAV8 but reduced LNP-mRNA transfection in neonatal and juvenile animals. These results highlight the importance of age-specific responses in the liver and will have translational applications for gene therapy programs."

It is also indicated for perioperative care in the same patient population in Europe and the United Kingdom. To assess the incidence of rebleeding and review treatment outcomes in subjects with haemophilia with inhibitors enrolled in the phase 3 PERSEPT 1 clinical trial. To treat mild/moderate bleeding episodes (BEs), subjects administered an initial 75 or 225µg/kg dose of eptacog beta, followed (if necessary) by additional 75µg/kg doses at predefined intervals until bleed control. This analysis used subject-reported rebleeding to determine a rebleeding incidence for the first 24 h. Rebleeding through later timepoints was an exploratory, intention-to-treat analysis of bleed treatment data. Four hundred and sixty-five BEs were analysed. Through 24 h, the proportion of rebleeds was 0% (initial 75µg/kg dose) and 0.5% (initial 225µg/kg dose). Through 48 h, the proportion of rebleeds was 3.2% (75µg/kg initial dose) and 5.6% (225µg/kg initial dose); the difference between initial dose strategies was not statistically significant. The majority of rebleeds were controlled with a single dose of eptacog beta and no subject who treated a rebleed required hospitalization. Subjects with haemophilia with inhibitors who used eptacog beta to treat mild/moderate BEs experienced a low incidence of rebleeding. Rebleeds that did occur were effectively controlled with eptacog beta (median, one dose) without the need for hospitalization."

    "abstract": "The history of hemophilia is well documented, yet reports focus heavily on the male perspective and severe forms of the disease. Although hemophilia was initially believed to only affect men with women seen as silent carriers, it is now universally acknowledged that women and girls can also be affected. In this narrative review, we tracked the progression of beliefs about women and hemophilia as documented in the literature from pre-1800s to the present time. We present a timeline of evolving beliefs and testing practices and identified 9 distinct time periods when key shifts occurred related to various scientific discoveries. Our review highlights how women affected by hemophilia experienced complete dismissal of their health issues despite evidence of bleeding symptoms as early as the 1900s. We identified 1990 as a major timepoint for shifting beliefs when large scale acknowledgment that hemophilia also affects women is documented and systematic testing for bleeding risk is first suggested. Women evolve from being seen as unaffected genetic transmitters only, to being recognized as a population affected by hemophilia in unique ways requiring timely testing and effective treatment. Yet, despite this clear progress, recent publications continue to document many persistent issues such as delayed diagnosis, untreated symptoms, and barriers to care. Ongoing research and advocacy efforts are required to improve knowledge translation until real-world outcomes are seen in screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of bleeding."

Our study aimed to analyze the learning dynamics and the evolving perspective of a single arthroplasty surgeon in hemophilic knees. The study encompassed all primary TKAs performed on hemophilic patients by a single experienced arthroplasty surgeon from May 2002 to October 2023. A total of 90 knees from 63 patients were included in the final analysis. Demographic characteristics, range of motion (ROM), degree of flexion contracture, and hip-knee angle (HKA) were noted. Anesthesia type, tourniquet duration, surgical approach, need for bone graft use, and lateral retinacular release (LRR) were also documented. Cases were categorized into three groups: the initial 30 cases (Group A), the subsequent 30 cases (Group B), and the final 30 cases (Group C). All groups were homogenous in terms of age (P = 0.102), HKA (P = 0.696), ROM (P = 0.582), and degree flexion contracture (P = 0.546). Extended approaches were needed in seven cases (23.3%) in Group A, and in two cases (6.7%) in Group B. There was no need for extended exposure in Group C. LRR application rate and tourniquet time showed no differences across groups (P = 0.401, P = 0.482). The intraoperative problem rate exhibited a statistically significant decrease throughout the series (P = 0.016). Arthroplasty in hemophilic knees poses unique challenges which require their own learning process. Intraoperative complication rate and need for utilizing extended approaches decreases after the initial 30 cases and decreases further after the subsequent 30 cases."

    "abstract": "The development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) poses a major challenge in hemophilia A (HA) treatment. The formation of FVIII inhibitors is a CD4+ T-cell-dependent mechanism which includes antigen presenting cells (APC), B- and T-helper lymphocytes. APC present FVIII-derived peptides on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) to CD4+ T cells. We previously established a mass spectrometry-based approach to delineate the FVIII repertoire presented on HLA-DR and HLA-DQ. In this study, specific attention was directed towards the identification of FVIII peptides presented on HLA-DP. A data-set of naturally processed FVIII peptides was generated by incubating human FVIII with immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) from HLA-typed healthy donors. Using this method, we identified 176 to 1,352 different HLA-DP presented peptides per donor, including 26 different FVIII-derived peptides. The most frequently presented peptides derived from the A3 and C2 domains of FVIII. Comparison of the FVIII repertoire presented on HLA-DP with that presented on HLA-DR revealed considerable overlap but also suggested preferential presentation of specific peptides on either HLA-DR or HLA-DP. Fourteen FVIII peptides presented on HLA-DP were synthesized and evaluated for their binding ability to the commonly expressed HLA-DP4 molecule which is highly prevalent in the Caucasian population. Peptide binding studies showed that 7 of 14 peptides competed with a reference peptide to HLA-DP4. Interestingly, an A3 domain-derived peptide bound with high affinity to HLA-DP4, positioning this peptide as a prime candidate for the development of novel peptide-based tolerogenic strategies for FVIII inhibitors."

    "abstract": "It is very difficult to identify the genetic variation of haemophilia A. We examined a case report from a sizable, uncommon haemophilia family, analysing the application of DHPLC in the diagnosis of haemophilia A. The comprehensive clinical data and laboratory assessments of the proband within the family were meticulously compiled. Subsequent to this, tests were conducted to evaluate the activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) and the clotting activity of coagulation factor VIII (F VIII: C). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were employed to identify any inversions within the F8 gene's introns 22 and 1. Thereafter, direct sequencing methodology was utilised to sequence all exons of the F8 gene. To analyse the copy number variations across all exons of the F8 gene, a multiple PCR combined with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) approach was adopted. In addition, specific pathogenic mutations predisposing to progenitor cell disorders were screened in family members. The APTT of the proband was 60 s. F VIII: C is < 1%. It was found that the progenitor F8 gene exon 14 had a 226 bp insertion sequence, which was of unknown origin and was a pathogenic mutation. The analysis combined with this family situation is consistent with the expectation. The mutation was used as the detection target to complete the prenatal diagnosis. The pathogenic mutation found in this family is a rare large fragment insertion mutation. It is necessary to combine multiple experimental methods to improve the success rate of genetic diagnosis of haemophilia A."

FVIII inhibitor levels were also determined with both reagents. Acceptable agreement of FVIII and FVIII inhibitor levels were obtained with the 2 reagents (R² = 0.92 and 0.96, respectively) in patients not exposed to emicizumab. The time-to-clot FVIII assay overestimated FVIII levels in patients on emicizumab therapy. The chromogenic FVIII assay delivered accurate endogenous FVIII levels in patients on emicizumab therapy. The TriniCHROM FVIII:C assay is compatible with routine automated coagulation analysers and delivers accurate FVIII and FVIII inhibitor levels."

It was mainly studied in hemophilia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of APTT-CWA in hemophilia carriers. This was a cross-sectional study including hemophilia carriers and healthy women volunteers. Bleeding assessment was performed using the ISTH-BAT. Laboratory assessment included APTT, APTT-CWA and FVIII:C or FIX:C. Thirty-two hemophilia carriers and 30 women as a control group were recruited. APTT was prolonged in 14 carriers and none of controls. Tmax 1 and Tmax 2 were significantly prolonged in hemophilia carriers compared to controls. Max 1 and Max 2 were significantly lower in carriers. Using ROC analysis, APTT-CWA parametrs cut-offs showed good sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between carriers and controls. When comparing bleeders and nonbleeders carriers, a significant difference was noted in Max 2, Min 2, Tmax 1 and Tmax 2. No correlation was found between APTT and bleeding score, nor between FVIII:C and Max 1. A positive significant correlation of FVIII:C with Max 2 was found. A negative and significant correlation of FVIII:C with Tmax 1, Tmax 2 and Min 2 was noticed. The APTT-CWA seems to be a good tool to evaluate bleeding tendency or detecting coagulation factor deficiency. Additional research efforts are warranted to explore the potential of APTT-CWA for identifying hemophilia carriers."

    "title": "Thrombin Generation Assay to Support Hematologists in the Era of New Hemophilia Therapies.",
    "abstract": "Hematology laboratories have traditionally monitored hemophilia replacement therapy by measuring coagulation factors before and after infusion. However, new drugs that do not rely on the replacement of the deficient factor require new approaches to laboratory monitoring, as factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) assays are no longer adequate. Non-factor therapies come in many different forms, that have one thing in common: they all increase thrombin generation. Their main adverse effect is thrombosis which may occur when too much thrombin is formed. This is the perfect mirror image of anticoagulant treatment, which always diminishes the amount of thrombin formed and has bleeding as its main adverse effect. Thrombin-forming capacity is decreased in congenital bleeding disorders and increased in prothrombotic conditions, indicating it governs bleeding and thrombosis. Therefore, the thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a logical tool for monitoring non-factor therapies, offering a comprehensive assessment of hemostatic balance. TGA identifies patients with severe bleeding, helps to optimize bypassing therapy, and detects hypercoagulability, making it ideal for guiding and monitoring hemophilia treatment with non-factor therapies. It also assesses the efficacy and safety of combined therapies, including non-factor therapies with bypassing agents or FVIII/FIX concentrates. The purpose of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge regarding the use of TGA to monitor novel hemophilia therapies. It will address controversies, limitations, and knowledge gaps related to the integration of TGA into personalized medicine in routine clinical practice."

The initial PubMed search on January 29, 2024, identified 2,843 articles, with 672 from January 1, 2014, onward. After screening, 21 articles met the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Among these, 12 focused on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and 9 on digital applications. AI was predominantly used for diagnosis (five studies) and treatment (four studies), while digital applications were mainly used for treatment (eight studies). Most studies addressed hemophilia A, with a smaller number including hemophilia B or von Willebrand disease. The findings reveal a lack of intervention studies in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, digital tools, including AI and digital applications, are increasingly used in managing hereditary coagulation disorders. AI enhances diagnostic accuracy and personalizes treatment, while digital applications improve patient care and engagement. Despite these advancements, study biases and design limitations indicate the need for further research to fully harness the potential of these technologies."

Data on gene therapy with hematopoietic stem-cell (HSC)-based expression of factor VIII for the treatment of severe hemophilia A are lacking. We conducted a single-center study involving five participants 22 to 41 years of age with severe hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. Autologous HSCs were transduced with CD68-ET3-LV - a lentiviral vector including a new <i>F8</i> transgene (<i>ET3</i>) with a myeloid-directed CD68 promoter - either without transduction enhancer (group 1) or with transduction enhancer (group 2). Transduced HSCs were transplanted into recipients after myeloablative conditioning. The treatment was assessed for safety (engraftment and regimen-related toxic effects) and efficacy (factor VIII activity and annualized bleeding rate). Participants received CD68-ET3-LV-transduced autologous CD34+ HSCs at doses of 5.0×10<sup>6</sup> to 6.1×10<sup>6</sup> per kilogram of body weight. The vector copy numbers in the final drug product were 1.0 and 0.6 copies per cell for the two participants in group 1 and 1.5, 0.6, and 2.2 copies per cell for the three participants in group 2. The duration of severe neutropenia was 7 to 11 days and of severe thrombocytopenia was 1 to 7 days. The median factor VIII activity level, measured with the use of a one-stage assay, after day 28 until the last follow-up visit was 5.2 IU per deciliter (range, 3.0 to 8.7) and 1.7 IU per deciliter (range, 1.0 to 4.0) with a peripheral-blood vector copy number of 0.2 and 0.1 copies per cell, respectively, in the two group 1 participants, and 37.1 IU per deciliter (range, 18.3 to 73.6), 19.3 IU per deciliter (range, 6.6 to 34.5), and 39.9 IU per deciliter (range, 20.6 to 55.1) with a peripheral-blood vector copy number of 4.4, 3.2, and 4.8 copies per cell, respectively, in the three group 2 participants.

    "abstract": "The SIPPET randomized clinical trial showed that in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe hemophilia A, treatment with plasma-derived factor (F)VIII (pdFVIII) within the first 50 exposure days (EDs) was associated with a lower cumulative incidence of inhibitors than with recombinant FVIII (rFVIII). Switching to rFVIII beyond 50 EDs with pdFVIII is a treatment often implemented by many centers. The question is whether or not this switch may induce a risk of inhibitor development. We investigated if in PUPs with severe hemophilia A switched after 50 EDs from pdFVIII to rFVIII, a novel inhibitor peak appears. The PUP-SWITCH observational retrospective study was designed to investigate the cumulative incidence of novel inhibitors after switching PUPs to rFVIII after 50 and before 150 EDs. Hemophilia centers that routinely switched PUPs from pdFVIII to rFVIII within this exposure time frame were invited to participate. Patients were followed up for at least 50 EDs after the switch. Ninety-seven patients were evaluated, and 87 were included according to eligibility criteria between 2020 and 2022. Only one of them developed an inhibitor 20 EDs after switching, so the cumulative incidence was 1.15% (95% CI, 0.03%-6.24%). PUP-SWITCH, a study focusing on PUPs undergoing a product class switch from pdFVIII to rFVIII after 50 EDs, showed that switching appears to be safe pertaining to the risk of development of new inhibitors."

Participants received monthly subcutaneous fitusiran (50 or 80 mg) under the original dose regimen until a voluntary dosing pause in 2020, after which the AT-based dose regimen was introduced, targeting the recommended AT activity levels of 15% to 35%. Thirty-four participants (hemophilia A, n = 27; hemophilia B, n = 7) were enrolled in the phase 2 study and treated with fitusiran for a median exposure of 4.1 years. Adverse events reported on the original and the AT-based dose regimen were consistent with the identified risks of fitusiran. After implementation of the AT-based dose regimen, there were no thrombotic events, and a reduction in the incidence of elevated transaminases and biliary events was reported. The observed median annualized bleed rate (ABR) on the AT-based dose regimen (0.87) was comparable with the ABR under the original dose regimen (0.70). Furthermore, fitusiran prophylaxis was associated with improved health-related quality of life compared with baseline and provided successful hemostatic control during surgical procedures and invasive interventions. Overall, fitusiran was well tolerated, and effective bleeding control was maintained on an AT-based dose regimen. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02554773."

The methodology used for assessing available evidence should consider this critical fact. In formulating guidelines, it is essential to include treatment goals and patient preference. This paper comprehensively critiques, against this background, the recommendations of the ISTH clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of haemophilia. Each recommendation was critically reviewed against available evidence as well as existing guidelines and commented upon for its scientific validity, impact on clinical practice and access to care globally. The validity of the way in which the GRADE methodology was applied to existing evidence was also assessed. The critique provided shows that these recommendations have major limitations: they did not state treatment goals and contradict existing guidelines; opportunities for providing access to innovation were missed when the therapeutic benefits of the products approved in the last decades were not included. A major reason for this is the inappropriate adoption of the GRADE methodology without adaptations and without considering treatment goals and patient-relevant outcomes. These recommendations may mislead healthcare professionals, payers and governments and therefore cannot serve the patient community well. They setback the advances made in haemophilia care because they overlook important available evidence and do not guide clinical practice to contemporary standards."

    "abstract": "Desmopressin acetate (DA) is a first-line option for the treatment of hemophilia A, von Willebrand's disease, nocturnal enuresis, central diabetes insipidus, and various traumatic injuries. We extended previously reported desmopressin-loaded elastic liposomes (ODEL1) to investigate mechanistic insights into ODEL1 mediated augmented permeation across rat skin. HSPiP software and instrumental techniques such as differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescent microscopy provided better understandings of permeation behavior. HSPiP was used to compare Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) of ODEL1, DA, components, and rat skins (control and treated) in terms of dispersion forces (δ<sub>d</sub>), polar forces (δ<sub>p</sub>), and hydrogen bonding (δ<sub>h</sub>). FTIR, DSC, fluorescence microscopy, and SEM provided a detailed mechanistic understanding of the changes occurred after treatment. The values of δ<sub>d</sub>, δ<sub>p</sub>, and δ<sub>H</sub> for DA were 20.6, 31.9, and 18.2 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, respectively, whereas these were 15.6, 14.97, and 2.4 MPa<sup>1/2</sup> for ODEL1, respectively, suggesting remarkable permeation of DA by changing innate cohesive energies of the skin. DA primarily interacts through δ<sub>d</sub> and δ<sub>p</sub> with the ODEL1 and the skin. Furthermore, the stretching and bending vibrations (molecular interactions) of the treated skins were quite diverse as compared to the untreated skin. ODEL1 caused a substantial thermal changes (shifted 67 to 65 °C, and 79 to 82.5 °C) for the surface protein and glycoprotein as compared to the untreated skin. Fluorescence and SEM confirmed relatively intense surface perturbation of the treated skin as compared to the control. Thus, ODEL1 was efficient in interacting with the skin surface for reversible changes and subsequently resulted in high permeation and drug deposition."

    "abstract": "Gene editing provides a promising alternative approach that may achieve long-term FVIII expression for hemophilia A (HemA) treatment. In this study, we investigated <i>in vivo</i> correction of a mutant factor VIII (FVIII) gene in HemA mice. We first developed MC3-based LNPs for efficient mRNA delivery into liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), the major site of FVIII biosynthesis. To target a five base pair deletion in FVIII exon 1 in a specific HemA mouse strain, we injected LNPs encapsulating Cas9 mRNA and specifically designed sgRNAs intravenously for <i>in vivo</i> gene editing of the mutant FVIII. Indel variants generated at the mutant site contained mostly a single base-pair deletion, resulting in frameshift correction of FVIII gene. Sustained endogenous FVIII activity up to 6% was achieved over 26 weeks in treated HemA mice. Sequencing data indicated an average gene editing rate of 15.3% in LSECs. Our study suggests that optimized MC3 LNP formulations, combined with CRISPR-Cas9 technology, can effectively correct the mutant FVIII gene in LSECs and restore FVIII activity for therapeutic treatment of HemA."

We developed two methods using clot waveform analysis (CWA) for plasma samples with prolonged aPTT, particularly for factor (F)VIII deficiency. One method estimates FVIII activity (FVIII:C) using CWA without measuring FVIII:C by template matching. The other utilizes CWA in the mixing test to quickly differentiate FVIII deficiency (FD), FVIII inhibitor (Inh), and lupus anticoagulant (LA). To establish a more accurate system for differential diagnosis of aPTT prolongation, including FIX deficiency, by combining a CWA-based mixing test and template matching. Samples with FD (n = 96), LA (n = 19), and Inh (n = 28) were incubated with normal plasma. FD, LA, and Inh were differentiated using a mixing test, followed by CWA-based template matching. In the mixing test, sensitivity for FD, Inh, and LA was 100%, 93%, and 100%, and specificity was 96%, 100%, and 100%. Samples with FIX inhibitor (> 0.6 BU/mL) were differentiated as the inhibitor sample. In template matching, almost all severe hemophilia A and B were judged as the respective severe types. This novel CWA-based measurement system could aid in differential diagnosis of prolonged aPTT."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A (HA) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by variants in F8. Although traditional mutational analyses have identified numerous pathogenic variants, the aetiology of HA in certain patients remains unclear. Furthermore, female patients with severe HA are rare. To investigate the molecular defects underlying severe HA in two patients and provide personalised reproductive interventions for their families. Two patients diagnosed with severe HA without other clinical phenotypes were enrolled in the study. A combination of whole-exome sequencing, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and long-read sequencing (LR-sequencing) was performed to reveal the molecular defects of them, followed by the application of different reproductive intervention strategies. Proband 1, a 29-year-old man with FVIII activity of 0.8%, did not exhibit common F8 variants, including Inv1 or Inv22, in the coding region. However, he carried a rare maternal novel inversion on ChrX:154148973_154170321, spanning approximately 21.345 Kbp, with breakpoints in introns 13 and 14 of F8. Finally, the couple of Proband 1 opted for assisted reproductive technology using preimplantation genetic testing and successfully conceived. Proband 2, a 20-year-old female with severe HA and FVIII activity of 0.6%, carried inv22 of F8. Further investigation combining whole exome sequencing (WES) and pedigree analysis revealed that she carried a maternal cross-deletion encompassing exons 1-22 of F8, FUNDC2, BRCC3 and CLIC2, along with a de novo missense variant c.5852T>C (p.Leu1951Ser) on her paternal X-chromosome. Chromosome X-inactivation (XCI) analysis demonstrated a highly skewed inactivation of the maternal X chromosome, with a ratio of 98:2. Subsequently, prenatal diagnosis confirmed that the third child in this family did not carry any of the F8 variants present in Proband 2. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic aetiology of HA and emphasise the importance of a definitive diagnosis in guiding genetic counselling and personalised reproductive interventions for affected individuals and their families."

For the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain related to hemophilic arthropathy, it is reasonable to use as a first step a combination of oral paracetamol (650 mg per every 6 h) or metamizole (575 mg per every 6 h), one of the COXIBS (e.g. celecoxib 200 mg per once a day) and a proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole 20 mg per once a day).

Clinical trials have focused on male patients with severe disease, and data for females are limited. Improved, evidence-based treatment guidelines for management of hemophilia A carriers are required. The NuDIMENSION study is a phase IV, prospective, open-label, single-arm study that will evaluate the perioperative efficacy and safety of simoctocog alfa (Nuwiq<sup>®</sup>), a recombinant factor VIII (FVIII), in women/girls with hemophilia A undergoing major surgery. The study will be conducted at approximately 15 centers worldwide. Women/girls aged ⩾12 years, with mild or moderate hemophilia A (residual FVIII activity (FVIII:C) ⩾1% to <40%) and with no current/past FVIII inhibitors are eligible. All patients must be scheduled to undergo a major surgical procedure during which simoctocog alfa will be administered. The primary endpoint is overall perioperative hemostatic efficacy (\"success\" or \"failure\") of simoctocog alfa. Hemostatic efficacy will be assessed at the end of surgery and at the end of the postoperative period (i.e., completion of wound healing), with overall adjudication by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Safety endpoints will include the incidences of thrombotic events and FVIII inhibitor development. The aim is to recruit 28 patients to achieve 26 evaluable surgeries. Ethical approval will be received from institutional review boards/independent ethics committees, and the study will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data from NuDIMENSION will generate much-needed evidence on surgical management of women/girls with hemophilia A, which will help to enable the development of treatment guidelines specific for such patients.

Briefly, 54 joints of 46 male patients with hemophilia type A and diagnosed with HA in Henan Provincial People's Hospital from August 2016 to September 2017 were selected. Plain and enhanced MRI were performed at the same time. The IPSG score of synovial hyperplasia and the total joint before and after enhancement were calculated, and the enhancement rate of the synovium and muscles at the same level were also calculated. The differences in synovial hyperplasia and joint total IPSG scores before and after enhancement were compared by paired rank sum test. The correlation between enhancement joint total IPSG score, synovial IPSG score, synovial enhancement rate, total joint bleeding number, course of disease, and Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) score were analyzed by Spearman's correlation analysis. <b>Results:</b> Enhanced MRI could more clearly show synovial hyperplasia and ensure better accuracy of joint total IPSG score (<i>Z</i>=-2.24, <i>P</i>=0.025). The enhancement extent of synovial hyperplasia was higher than that of the same level muscle. There was no correlation between synovial enhancement rate and total number of joint bleeding, course of disease, and HJHS score. After enhancement, the joint total IPSG score was highly positively correlated with the total number of joint bleeding and the disease course (<i>r</i>=0.96, 0.84, <i>P</i><0.001) and moderately positively correlated with the HJHS score (<i>r</i>=0.58, <i>P</i><0.001).

We reviewed 50 patients who had hemophilia A, including 26 single TJA (STJA) (13 total knee arthroplasty [TKA] and 13 total hip arthroplasty [THA]) and 24 simultaneous double TJA (Sim-DTJA) (including 10 bilateral TKAs, 10 bilateral THAs, and four patients who had simultaneous THA and TKA). Length of hospitalization, blood loss, total exogenous coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) usage, perioperative FVIII levels, perioperative activated partial thromboplastin time, perioperative transfusion rates, and postoperative complications were assessed and compared. Perioperative FVIII levels and activated partial thromboplastin time were not different between Sim-DTJA and STJA. Total blood loss (1,216.0 ± 450.4 mL) and hidden blood loss (1,020.0 ± 419.9 mL) were slightly higher in Sim-DTJA than in STJA (1,062.0 ± 371.8 mL and 929.9 ± 351.6 mL, respectively) (P = 0.192, P = 0.416, respectively).

The authors of these guidelines should be commended for a herculean task that took years to complete, and while this is no doubt a welcome addition to the literature, it does leave many questions for the clinician. This is primarily because 11 of the 13 recommendations are conditional, essentially meaning \"that clinicians and patients need to consider individual preferences as well as the specific circumstances in which the decision is being made for implementation of the recommendation.\" So, in essence, most of the recommendations allow the clinician to decide whether to use them or not. In our view, most clinicians are seeking more concrete recommendations when they search for a guidelines paper. Unfortunately, numerous conditional recommendations have been developed because hemophilia is a rare disease and the ISTH Guidelines rely upon the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We endeavored to \"deconstruct\" the ISTH recommendations and offer clinicians a more concrete path forward based in part on the guidelines but supplemented with more recent literature and our own extensive experience and perspective managing hemophilia patients of all ages from 4 continents."

    "abstract": "The main complication in hemophilia A treatment is the development of inhibitory antibodies against factor (F)VIII. Immune tolerance induction, the gold standard for eradicating anti-FVIII antibodies, is efficient in only 60% to 80% of cases. This underscores the need for more efficient induction of tolerance in patients with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors. In this study, we explored whether red blood cells (RBCs) can be utilized as antigen delivery system to modulate the immune response against FVIII. Two promiscuously HLA-DR-presented peptides derived from the A2 and C1 domains of FVIII were fused to the TAT cell-penetrating peptide and incubated with RBCs. Biotinylated TAT-A2 and TAT-C1 peptides were found to interact with RBCs as shown by flow cytometry and imaging flow cytometry. Moreover, macrophages efficiently phagocytosed TAT-FVIII peptide-treated RBCs. Using mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics we established that TAT-FVIII peptides were presented on major histocompatibility complex class II of macrophages that phagocytosed TAT peptide-pulsed RBCs. Specifically, the TAT-A2 peptide exhibited efficient processing and presentation on HLA-DR molecules. Importantly, incubation of TAT-C1 peptide-treated RBCs-loaded macrophages with a FVIII-specific T-cell hybridoma led to a significant increase in IL-2 production, suggesting functional presentation of TAT-C1-derived peptides by macrophages. Our findings indicate that RBCs can serve as effective vehicle for the delivery of FVIII-derived peptides to antigen-presenting cells. The successful display of T-cell epitopes on antigen-presenting cell using ex vivo-loaded RBC may be potentially utilized to modulate pathogenic immune responses such as observed in a subset of patients with hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "Non-factor replacement therapies (NFTs) have been developed to address the limitations of conventional replacement therapies, aiming to improve hemostasis and provide enhanced protection against bleeding episodes and long-term joint damage for patients both with and without inhibitors. Factor VIII (FVIII)-mimetic agents, such as emicizumab, have transformed the management of hemophilia A with inhibitors, offering a lower treatment burden and an effective alternative for those without inhibitors as well. Rebalancing agents, including anti-tissular factor pathway inhibitor agents (concizumab and marstacimab) and serpin inhibitors like fitusiran, have shown promising efficacy for patients with hemophilia B with inhibitors and other hemophilia subtypes. Administered subcutaneously, NFTs generate stable thrombin levels and feature a long half-life, which can shift severe hemophilia toward a milder phenotype. These therapies are effective regardless of inhibitor status and hold potential for application in other bleeding disorders. Evaluating the potential thrombotic risk after implementing mitigation measures, along with the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), remain critical areas for further analysis. NFTs pose additional challenges due to their complex mechanism of action and the absence of a standardized laboratory assessment method. Unresolved issues include optimal management strategies for major surgeries and tailored approaches for safe use in older populations. This review highlights the progress and future potential of NFTs in treating persons with hemophilia."

    "abstract": "Historically, the aim of treatment for hemophilia, the congenital X-linked hemorrhagic disorder due to deficiencies of coagulation Factor (F) VIII (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B), has been the replacement through factor concentrates, whose regular administration (i.e., prophylaxis) has been shown to be highly effective in preventing bleeding complications and it is currently considered the gold standard of hemophilia treatment. However, continuous technological progress (i.e., plasma-derived factor concentrates, recombinant standard and extended half-life [EHL] products) has allowed clinicians operating at hemophilia treatment centers to individualize the management of persons with hemophilia, improving outcomes, adherence to therapy, and their quality of life. The achievement of normal hemostasis, the final goal that now seems possible with new-generation EHL products, non-replacement and gene therapies, will translate into normalization of life for persons with hemophilia, also addressing health equity (i.e., rendering them indistinguishable from their healthy peers). The evolution of hemophilia treatment and, in parallel, of therapeutic targets in the management of hemophilia patients over the last decades will be critically discussed in this narrative review."

Twenty days later, he ran to the emergency room complaining of squeezing chest pain. ECG showed mild ST segment elevation in inferior territories. Invasive coronary angiography via right radial artery revealed severe thrombotic occlusion at the same lesion. A bare metal stent was deployed and dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and clopidogrel had been maintained for 6 months under the conventional hemophilia management. The patient did not develop any coronary events just with single clopidogrel therapy for 5 years until he passed away from pancreatic cancer.

Clinical examination revealed bilateral swollen upper eyelids with palpable mass lesions in the lacrimal fossa. The submandibular and sublingual glands were enlarged, tender, and movable. Neck ultrasound showed bilateral gland enlargement with irregular hypoechoic parenchyma. Maxillofacial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral lacrimal glands enlargement, homogeneous enlarged bilateral submandibular and parotid glands, measuring 4.7 × 3.9 cm. Laboratory investigation showed increased activated partial prothromboplastin time (80.9 s), markedly decreased FVIII activity (0.6%), a high titer of FVIII inhibitor (480 Bethesda units/mL), and a remarkable increase in serum IgG4 level (1005.68 mg/dL).

Prophylaxis reduces the risk of ICH and earlier initiation of prophylaxis may now be feasible, especially in hemophilia A (HA). The aim of the study is to explore the potential for preventing ICH by earlier start of prophylaxis by assessing the natural course of ICH before the initiation of prophylaxis and describe timing and incidence (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT02979119). In total, 2,727 children (2,275 with HA; 452 with hemophilia B [HB]) were included from the PedNet Registry, followed from 28 days until 36 months of life. ICH was observed in 61 children (incidence 2.2%; 10 per 1,000 patient years), with 75% of cases occurring before 1 year of age. Cumulative incidence was significantly lower in HB (0.9%) compared to HA (2.5%) and in non-severe HA (0.7%) compared to severe HA (3.5%). ICH occurred early, with a rise at 3 months, and a median age of 7.0 months in severe HA and 5.4 months in severe HB. In 40% of children, ICH occurred before the diagnosis of hemophilia was established, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis. Assuming that prophylaxis would have been started at the time of diagnosis and preventing all ICH in children with severe HA, the number needed to treat with prophylaxis would be 44 patients to prevent one ICH. Hopefully, prophylaxis options allowing initiation early in life, ideally before 3 months of age for children with severe HA, will reduce the incidence of ICH in the future."

The natural history of joint health in HC is not yet defined. A multi-institutional cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of joint disease in HC, aged 18-40 years, compared to age-matched controls. The carrier cohort included females with confirmed HC status. Controls had no personal or family history of bleeding disorders. All females with a history of joint trauma or surgery within 12 months or any history of joint replacement were excluded. Joint health was assessed by clinical history, Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) and point-of-care musculoskeletal ultrasonography (POC-MSKUS). Thirty HC and 30 controls were enrolled. For HC, the median factor activity level was 52% (range 17%-100%). Carriers, regardless of baseline factor activity levels, reported higher prevalence of chronic joint pain (p < .001) and swelling (p = .002) than controls. Heavy menstrual bleeding, epistaxis, gingival bleeding and easy bruising were also more prevalent in HC (p < .001).

HC with a body mass index ≥25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> reported more haemarthrosis (p = .037). HC are at increased risk of joint-related symptoms and poorer joint health than age-matched controls. Dedicated follow-up to prevent and treat joint disease in HC is imperative.

    "title": "Assessing the factors affecting the accessibility of primary dental care for people with haemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Patients with haemophilia (PWH) often have difficulty accessing dental services. To determine the accessibility of dental care for PWH and to examine their perceptions of how coronavirus type-2 (CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has affected their ability to access dental treatments following the pandemic. The questionnaire survey was conducted between July 2022 and December 2022 at haemophilia treatment centres in Hungary. Variables with statistical significance (Pearson's Chi-squared test; p < .05) were included in logistic regression analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used as a machine learning technique to identify the most predictive variables. Twenty-one percent of the sixty-eight participants reported that they had been refused dental treatment, mainly in primary care (86%). Dental refusal was influenced by infectious disease (OR: 4.48, CI: 1.14-17.69) and previous dental bleeding complications (OR: 4.23, CI: 1.10-16.27). There was correlation between dental visits and having a permanent dentist or receiving oral hygiene advice (OR: 9.95, CI: 2.86-34.62 and OR: 3.84, CI: 1.09-13.58). Participation in an oral hygiene consultation increased patients' satisfaction with their dental care (OR: 6.28, 95% CI: .71-55.88). Twenty-eight percent of patients had experienced difficulties since the start of the COVID-19, but 84% had visited their dentist at least once between 2021 and 2022 (p = .002). Nevertheless, 16% of respondents went for only the most necessary treatments due to pandemic. Refusal of dental care was high among participants, especially in primary care. The COVID-19 pandemic has exaggerated the difficulties of PWH in accessing dental treatment. Patients with haemophilia (PWH) have difficulty accessing dental care, and the coronavirus type 2 (CoV-2) disease pandemic (COVID-19) has created a new barrier. The study revealed a high prevalence of dental care refusal (21%), particularly in primary care (86%). This 2022 survey found that 28% of patients experienced difficulties since the pandemic started and 16% only sought necessary treatments."

    "abstract": "Understanding the disease-specific risks and patient-related barriers of children with bleeding disorders is necessary for primary oral health promotion. Our goal was to assess the oral health status and the impact of oral health promotion among patients with bleeding disorders. At baseline, 70 patients with inherited and acquired bleeding disorders had a complete intraoral examination, completed the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) questionnaires, and an oral health education was given. After 6 months, the effectiveness of the oral hygiene promotion was evaluated clinically and through the OHRQoL questionnaires. Our cohort included 33 patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (cITP), 27 hemophilia A patients, and 10 with inherited thrombasthenia. Forty patients (57.1%) had dental caries, 90.0% showed fair oral hygiene status with variable degrees of gingivitis. The baseline self-image score was significantly inferior among patients with inherited bleeding disorders, while the psychological domain for family was greatly affected among cITP patients. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in the oral debris, the modified gingival indexes, the percentages of cases with oral bleeding, and a significantly improved mean OHRQoL total score. After the oral health education, the OHRQoL scores had significantly improved, and oral hygiene status were acceptable among patients with bleeding disorders."

    "abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>: We report the case of a neonate diagnosed with severe hemophilia A (HA) and conduct a literature review of cases of severe HA presenting at the neonatal age to help define the clinical diagnostic findings and existing differences between the sporadic and familial onset of this condition. <b>Report of a Case</b>: A 6-day-old newborn presented with worsening pallor, inappetence, and hyporeactivity for 48 h. The diagnosis was severe hemophilia A (HA), leading to an unfavorable outcome. A literature review focusing on case reports and series focusing on the clinical expression of HA in neonates was conducted, documenting clinical presentation, family history, and outcomes. Literature review: Forty patients were included. HA was observed in five cases (12.5%) of very preterm births (≤32 weeks) and in four cases (10%) of moderately or late preterm births. Seventeen patients (43%) had a family history, with inheritance being sporadic (21 newborns, 53%) or acquired (2 cases, 4%). Clinical onset typically occurred within the first week of life (approximately 8 out of 10 cases), while only three cases (7.5%) had onset after the first month. Inherited cases presented with hemorrhagic states (nine cases), hypovolemic shock (five cases), or intracranial hypertension (two cases). Sporadic cases showed localized bleeding (11 cases), hypovolemic shock (5 cases), or neurological symptoms like seizures and anisocoria (5 cases). Acquired cases included severe intracranial hemorrhage in one case. <b>Conclusions</b>: Neonatal HA can manifest with severe symptoms and rapid progression, making early diagnosis crucial. Non-specific signs and the absence of coagulophaty disorders in family history can delay diagnosis. Symptoms like prolonged bleeding, cutaneous hematomas, or intracranial bleeding necessitate ruling out major coagulopathy, and neurological signs require immediate imaging to exclude intracranial bleeding."

    "abstract": "The discovery of the structure of DNA and the mechanisms that regulate gene expression during the first half of the last century established the theoretical and methodological bases for the development of technology that makes it possible to modify a gene or a genome. The clinical application of techniques that modify the expression of a gene is called gene therapy (GT). These techniques include platforms (viral and non-viral) that bring genetic modification systems or healthy genes to the target cells. ClinicalTrial.gov is a repository of clinical trials that incorporates protocols using TG. In this work, a systematic review of the works registered in ClinicalTrial.gov on the use of TG in hematological diseases was carried out. A total of 41 GT-related clinical trials were found most of which were registered in the United States of America (56.1%). On the other hand, 41.46% of the protocols obtained private funding. Of 50% of all pathologies, only diseases of hematological origin of monogenic origin (hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and Fanconi anemia) received TG. On the other hand, the number of clinical protocols registered by country was positively correlated with economic development, scientific development, investment in health per capita, and quality of life. Finally, there are still many bioethical, social, political, and economic controversies that must be solved."

    "abstract": "Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the gold standard for inhibitor eradication to restore the clinical efficacy of factor replacement therapy in haemophilia. However, as ITI often requires frequent administration over extended periods, it can be considered burdensome for patients and healthcare resources. Therefore, there is a need to optimise ITI treatment, particularly in patients who failed previous ITI attempts. The ReITIrate study aimed to prospectively evaluate rescue ITI with efmoroctocog alfa, an extended half-life recombinant FVIII Fc fusion protein (herein rFVIIIFc), within a limited 60-week timeframe in patients with severe haemophilia A and inhibitors who failed previous ITI attempts. ReITIrate was a phase IV, open-label, single-arm, interventional, multicentre study. Primary endpoint was ITI success (negative titre, <0.6 BU/mL; incremental recovery >66%; elimination half-life ⩾7 hours) within 60 weeks. Exploratory immunophenotype analyses were performed to characterise anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and cellular immune responses. Nine of 16 enrolled subjects completed the ITI period during ReITIrate, of which one subject attained all 3 ITI success criteria after 46 weeks with no relapse. Two subjects achieved partial success (one subject met 2/3 success criteria; one met all criteria, but not simultaneously, with inhibitor recurrence). One additional subject (ITI failure) achieved negative inhibitor titre. Across these four subjects, median (range) time to negative titre was 19 (11-60) weeks. No new safety concerns were identified. IgG4 was the major contributor to the ADA IgG response. Subjects with partial/complete ITI success had fewer IgG subclasses involved than those who failed/withdrew. Immunophenotyping indicated an increase in regulatory T-cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>), supporting the ability to perform sensitive blood sampling to identify immune tolerance markers. This study demonstrates that ITI with rFVIIIFc given within a limited timeframe has potential benefit in a difficult-to-treat inhibitor haemophilia population who failed previous ITI attempts.

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) therapy poses a significant healthcare burden. In recent years, emicizumab has been approved for prophylaxis. The current study explores the impact of transitioning to emicizumab on emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in pediatric and adult HA patients. Data of HA patients transitioned to emicizumab at the Israeli National Hemophilia Center was retrospectively analyzed. Demographic information, inhibitor status, treatment duration, number, and reasons of ED visits and hospitalizations were assessed. Overall, transitioning to emicizumab significantly reduced ED visits and hospitalizations. While children experienced a significant reduction in both ED visits and hospitalizations, adults showed no statistically significant change. Post-emicizumab initiation, main reasons for ED visits among children shifted from prophylactic treatment and central line-associated complications to injury-related incidents. This real-world analysis demonstrates a substantial decrease in ED visits and hospitalizations, following emicizumab prophylaxis in HA patients. However, this improvement was age dependent as it was observed only among children. Further prospective studies evaluating this aspect may shed light on these findings."

    "abstract": "Hemophilic arthritis (HA) is one of the most pathologically altered joint diseases. Specifically, periodic spontaneous hemorrhage-induced hyperinflammation of the synovium and irreversible destruction of the cartilage are the main mechanisms that profoundly affect the behavioral functioning and quality of life of patients. In this study, we isolated and characterized platelet-rich plasma-derived exosomes (PRP-exo). We performed microRNA (miRNA) sequencing and bioinformatics analysis on these exosomes to identify the most abundant miRNA, miR-451a. Following this, we developed an M@ZIF-8@miR nanotherapeutic system that utilizes nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) as a carrier for miRNA delivery, encapsulated within M2 membranes to enhance its anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that M@ZIF-8@miR significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, controlled synovial inflammation, and achieved potent therapeutic efficacy by reducing joint damage. We suggest that the ability of M@ZIF-8@miR nanocomposites to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhance cellular uptake, and exhibit good endosomal escape properties makes them promising carriers for the efficient delivery of therapeutic nucleic acid drugs. This approach delays joint degeneration and provides a promising combinatorial strategy for HA treatment."

The aim of this study was to indirectly compare bleed outcomes between efanesoctocog alfa and standard/extended half-life (SHL and EHL) FVIII replacement therapies in adolescent and adult patients with severe haemophilia A without inhibitors. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify Phase 3 trials of EHL and SHL FVIII replacement therapies for comparison with efanesoctocog alfa data from XTEND-1. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons were used to compare annualised bleeding rates (ABRs) for any, treated, joint, and spontaneous bleeds between efanesoctocog alfa and comparators. The estimates from respective comparisons were pooled using random-effect meta-analyses to evaluate the overall difference between efanesoctocog alfa and comparator therapies. Four EHL therapies (rurioctocog alfa pegol, efmoroctocog alfa, turoctocog alfa pegol, damoctocog alfa pegol) and two octocog alfa SHL therapies were included.

Gene therapy is a transformative, irreversible treatment with long-lasting effects, necessitating development of new clinical pathways to ensure optimal outcomes. To develop a consensus framework and service specification for delivery of AAV gene therapy for haemophilia in adults within the UK using the hub-and-spoke model proposed by the European Association of Haemophilia and Allied Disorders and the European Haemophilia Consortium. The UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organisation (UKHCDO) set up a working party to develop expert consensus guidance, working with NHS England to ensure alignment with NHS England commissioning and the national service specification. These guidelines detail the patient pathway, counselling and governance requirements for the hub-and-spoke model. The national service specification requires the hub site to manage governance for AAV-based gene therapy. Proposed regional and national multidisciplinary teams will harmonize clinical practices incorporating expertise from various specialities and professional groups. Key requirements identified include standardized documentation and multidisciplinary collaboration. Nationally agreed patient information and counselling checklists will streamline the informed consent process and facilitate data collection for long-term safety and efficacy monitoring. These guidelines provide a structured framework for the delivery of liver-directed gene therapy. Whilst specific to the United Kingdom they provide a framework for the implementation of gene therapy in other countries for haemophilia and other monogenic disorders."

This study investigates the effectiveness of a preventative approach using intermediate-dose prophylaxis with standard half-life FVIII products in reducing bleeding rates and enhancing the quality of life for patients with severe HA. A 4-year prospective longitudinal study followed 35 patients with severe HA (without FVIII inhibitors) who transitioned from a reactive treatment approach to intermediate-dose prophylaxis in Taiwan from 2014 until 2018. The study tracked annual bleeding rates (ABR) and annual joint bleeding rates (AjBR) alongside associated costs and patient-reported quality-of-life measures. Prophylaxis significantly reduced both ABR and AjBR compared with the previous treatment. After one year, ABR and AjBR decreased by 76.9% and 72.5%, respectively, with further reductions to 91.0% and 90.8% after 4 years (p < 0.001). While the average annual cost of factor VIII concentrate increased by 41.0% in the first year, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio demonstrated ongoing benefits from ABR avoidance over the 4 years. Additionally, patients reported significant improvements in quality-of-life measures following the switch to prophylaxis (p = 0.036). Intermediate-dose prophylaxis effectively reduced bleeding rates and improved quality of life in patients with severe HA. Despite initial cost increases, the intervention became cost effective over time. This study provides valuable data for healthcare policymakers, highlighting the long-term benefits of prophylaxis as a preventative approach for managing bleeding and improving overall well-being in patients with severe HA."

    "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated direct medical or societal costs of haemophilia in the United Kingdom (UK), and how patient characteristics impact future costs is uncertain. Cost predictors were identified and examined using cross-sectional data from the CHESS I and II studies. Patient- and physician-reported outcomes were analysed for UK adult males aged ≤ 65, with haemophilia A or B and no recent clinical trial participation. Demographics, haemophilia type and severity, inhibitors, annual bleed rate (ABR), problem joints (PJs), treatment type, and comorbidities, were utilised in regression analyses. Health-related quality of life was assessed using EQ-5D. Generalised linear models estimated expected non-drug haemophilia-related direct medical costs (DMC) and societal costs (non-drug DMC, direct non-medical and indirect costs). Average marginal effects (AMEs) determined predictors of cost. Costs for 378 patients were analysed. Mean age was 33 years and 79% (299) had haemophilia A. Mean annual per-patient DMC were £165,001 (including factor treatment costs) and £4,091 when excluding factor replacement treatment costs (non-drug DMC). Mean annual per-patient non-treatment societal costs were £11,550 (standard deviation £20,171) among those with data available (n = 51). Number of PJs, ABR, and treatment regimen were significant determinants of haemophilia-related non-drug DMC (all P < 0.001). Non-drug DMC increased as ABR increased (AMEs were £2,018 for ABR 1-5, £3,101 for ABR 6-10 and £5,785 for ABR ≥ 11, vs. ABR 0) and by £1,869 per additional PJ. No significant predictors of non-drug haemophilia-related societal costs were identified. Mean EQ-5D score was 0.66, with lower scores observed for people with haemophilia B (0.48) compared with haemophilia A (0.71) and with increasing haemophilia severity. UK direct medical and societal costs of haemophilia are substantial. Non-drug DMC were particularly associated with ABR and number of PJs. These findings may be useful for real-world evaluations of the economic burden of haemophilia in the UK."

Estimating the individual chance of ITI success allows clinicians, patients, and their families to support shared decision-making. We aimed to identify clinical predictors of ITI success and to develop a clinical prediction model to estimate the chance of successful ITI in persons with severe HA. This multicenter study included persons with severe HA who received ITI. Clinical data were collected. Successful ITI was defined by a negative inhibitor titer and an adequate response to FVIII concentrates. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed. Model performance and internal validation were performed. Of 206 participants with a median age of 19.8 months (IQR, 12.1-38.8) at ITI start, 148 (71.8%) achieved ITI success.

Thirty-two studies were included in the final review, covering a total of 171 AHA patients. The majority started emicizumab for active bleeding management and prophylaxis with various regimens. Follow-up duration and remission criteria varied. Two clinical trials supported the use of emicizumab for bleeding prophylaxis with a new dosing regimen and completion criteria. Bleeding was well managed in all cases, with no major recurrent bleeds. Some adverse events were reported : 3 cases of deep venous thrombosis, 2 cases of stroke, and 2 cases of anti-emicizumab drug antibodies developing in patients with thromboembolic risk factors. Based on published data, emicizumab appears to be effective in bleeding management and prophylaxis in AHA patients, with a favorable benefit/risk profile."

    "title": "Challenges associated with access to recently developed hemophilia treatments in routine care: perspectives of healthcare professionals.",
    "abstract": "The treatment landscape for hemophilia continues to rapidly develop, and expectations for future treatment success are high. There is limited information on the challenges of accessing new and innovative therapies. The aim of this study was to explore challenges of accessing hemophilia treatment from the perspective of healthcare professionals (HCP). A cross-sectional study design was used. A pilot-tested, online survey was distributed to hemophilia treatment centers in Australia, Canada, France, Italy, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Turkey, USA and UK. The questionnaire covered questions on product access, economic considerations, health technology assessment requirements, and patient organization involvement. The results were analyzed descriptively using SPSS. A total of 154 HCP completed the questionnaire. There was heterogeneity across countries, regions, and centers regarding HCP knowledge of access to novel recently developed treatments. Notable limitations to access were reported such as differences in access based on age of patient and type of product, economic considerations, and the growing influence of health technology assessment bodies. Many countries have a hemophilia patient organization that does not have a vote at the decision-making table. There is a need to empower HCP to better understand national healthcare structures and decisions that lead to access limitations. Requirements from health technology assessment bodies must be understood to optimally design clinical studies and value generation of treatment options. This may strengthen the hemophilia treatment center's voice to collectively mandate for exchange with key involved individuals, such as the payers and politicians for the provision of optimal therapy."

    "title": "Acquired hemophilia A: a narrative review and management approach in the emicizumab era.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by inhibitory autoantibodies to factor (F)VIII. The goals of treatment are 2-fold, namely immunosuppressive therapy to eradicate the inhibitor and hemostatic management to control bleeding. Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that acts as a FVIIIa-mimetic, has seen growing use in AHA following its approval for congenital hemophilia A. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AHA. Registry, trial, and case series data are assimilated and summarized with an emphasis on a standardized approach that integrates the use of emicizumab. With recent registry data suggesting the need to focus on immunosuppression-related mortality in AHA, we provide treatment recommendations in an algorithmic format that have become the standard of care at our institution. These recommendations are intended to minimize hemostatic product usage and potential toxicity related to immunosuppressive therapy while reducing morbidity and rehospitalization rates for bleeding. The proposed treatment algorithm, which includes key interventions by phase of therapy, can be readily implemented at centers that have rapid access to plasma FVIII activity using a one-stage assay. A case is presented to illustrate the proposed diagnostic and management considerations."

    "title": "Examining downstream effects of concizumab in hemophilia A with a mathematical modeling approach.",
    "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an anticoagulant protein that inhibits factor (F)Xa, the TF-FVIIa-FXa complex, and early forms of the prothrombinase complex. Concizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks FXa inhibition by TFPI and reduces bleeding in hemophilia. To examine how concizumab impacts various reactions of TFPI to restore thrombin generation in hemophilia A using mathematical models. A compartment model was used to estimate plasma concentrations of free concizumab and its complexes with TFPIα and TFPIβ. Concizumab was integrated into a flow-mediated mathematical model of coagulation, and a small injury was simulated under hemophilia A conditions. Simulations were then analyzed to determine how concizumab's blockade of TFPI anticoagulant activities, specifically the inhibition of FXa in plasma and on platelets, inhibition of TF:FVIIa at the subendothelium, and prior sequestration of plasma TFPIα to the endothelium via TFPIβ, altered thrombin generation. Concizumab improved simulated thrombin generation in hemophilia A by simultaneously altering all 3 mechanisms of the TFPI anticoagulant blockade examined. Concizumab sequestered ∼75% of plasma TFPIα through the formation of ternary TFPIα-concizumab-TFPIβ-complexes. For all TF levels, reducing the TFPIα plasma concentration had the largest impact on the lag time, followed by blocking TFPIα inhibition of TF:FVIIa:FXa and subsequently by blocking TFPIα inhibition of FXa in plasma and on the platelet surface. The effectiveness of concizumab is mediated through the blockade of TFPI anticoagulant activities in plasma and on multiple physiological surfaces. An important and previously unrecognized function of concizumab was the sequestration of plasma TFPIα to the endothelium."

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence in females with hemophilia A has shown significant bleeding symptoms. Accurate factor (F) VIII activity (FVIII:C) measurement is essential to assign correct diagnosis and severity. Assay discrepancies reported in male patients with hemophilia A are not well studied in females. Our research sought to assess the association of FVIII:C levels by one-stage versus chromogenic assays and the assay discrepancy with bleeding phenotype and genetic mutation in females with hemophilia A. Data from 64 females with hemophilia A from our center were reviewed with center's institutional review board approval. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Bland-Altman plot analysis were applied. Abnormal International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding assessment tool score was seen in 52% (FVIII:C <40 IU/dL: 72%/73%; FVIII:C ≥40 IU/dL: 41%/45%; by one-stage and chromogenic assays, respectively), more often in adults and postmenarchal patients. Assay discrepancies were present, direct more often than inverse. Based on one assay result only, 11 (17%) patients would have been incorrectly diagnosed and 1 (1.5%) patient would have been assigned incorrect hemophilia severity. No associations of genetic variants with FVIII:C levels and bleeding phenotype were found. Our study emphasizes the importance of evaluating female patients with hemophilia A for bleeding phenotype. Our study is the first to document prevalence of assay discrepancies exclusively in females with hemophilia A, which can lead to inaccurate diagnosis and severity assignment. Future larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate our findings, to help develop recommendations regarding the appropriate use of assays for accurate diagnosis and to further elucidate the association of genetic variants with bleeding phenotype and assay discrepancies."

    "title": "A time trade-off study in the UK, Canada and the US to estimate utilities associated with the treatment of haemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Haemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder caused by a deficient or absent clotting factor, leading to frequent bleeding. Multiple intravenous (IV) infusions have been the standard prophylactic treatment; however, newer treatment options involve less frequent subcutaneous (SC) injections. To inform future health economic evaluations, this study applied the time trade-off (TTO) method for estimation of utilities associated with haemophilia treatment for both people with the disease and potential caregivers. Using the TTO method, utilities were estimated through two online surveys distributed in the UK, Canada and the US. In survey 1 (S1), adults from the general population aged 18 years and above evaluated health states as if they were living with haemophilia themselves and were receiving treatment for the condition. In survey 2 (S2), adults from the general population with a child under the age of 15 years evaluated health states as if they were treating their child for haemophilia. The surveys assessed the following treatment aspects: frequency of treatment, treatment device and injection site reactions. In total, 812, 739 and 703 respondents completed S1 and 712, 594 and 527 completed S2 in the UK, Canada and the US, respectively. In both surveys, the treatment device was associated with the largest impact on utilities for both people with haemophilia and caregivers. Monthly SC injections with a prefilled pen-device were associated with a significant utility gain compared with SC injections with a syringe and IV infusions. In S1, a lower treatment frequency was preferred in all three countries, while in S2, a lower treatment frequency was preferred only in the UK. Avoiding injection site reactions was associated with a significant utility gain in both surveys, but only in the UK and Canada. The study suggests that the administration of haemophilia treatment in particular has an impact on utilities for both people and caregivers living with the disease. Thus, less complex and time-consuming treatment devices are expected to improve health-related quality of life. This can be further modified additively by less frequent administration. These results can inform future health economic analyses of haemophilia and haemophilia treatment."

This analysis examines global disparities in hemophilia care, focusing on global prophylactic coverage and its correlation with the World Bank's world development indicators. It outlines the disproportionate consumption of clotting factors and non-factor concentrates in high-income countries compared to lower-income counterparts and the challenges of expanding prophylaxis coverage in under-resourced settings. The analysis integrates socioeconomic data with global health indicators to understand these disparities and advocates for increased distribution of treatment resources across all income levels, emphasizing the need for policy changes to improve hemophilia care worldwide. Studies addressing the prophylaxis perspectives in hemophilia were selected using PubMed and Google Scholar platforms (unlimited time frame). Articles were supplemented with WFH's annual surveys and guidelines, including the WFH Global Survey 2022, WFH Guidelines for the Management of Hemophilia 2020 and World Bank data. Significant disparities in hemophilia care and factor usage exist between high-income and lower-income countries. Standardized, harmonized metrics for different types of factor consumption are critical to accurately assess and compare hemophilia care on an international basis."

Laboratory tests showed a normal platelet count, deranged coagulation parameters and severely decreased Factor VIII activity levels. Due to the unavailability of Factor VIII concentrate, the patient was transfused with fresh frozen plasma with no recurrence of bleeding and was discharged well. He was referred to haemophilia foundations for procurement of Factor VIII concentrates for emergency use. Subsequently, the patient presented with spontaneous left cheek swelling at 3 months old. Repeat coagulation parameters showed a twice elevated partial thromboplastin time and he was given Factor VIII concentrate at the emergency room.

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder that presents with spontaneous bleeding due to the development of autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII. This study aims to highlight the challenges in diagnosing and treating AHA, particularly through presenting two cases managed with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, to demonstrate its safety and efficacy as a treatment option. Two male patients, aged 38 and 68, with significant bleeding episodes and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), were evaluated. Both patients received standard care, including factor VIII replacement and corticosteroids. Due to persistent symptoms, rituximab was administered weekly for four weeks, and follow-up assessments were performed to monitor factor VIII levels, aPTT, and clinical symptoms. Both cases showed improvement with rituximab. In Case 1, a 38-year-old male with idiopathic AHA achieved normal factor VIII levels and aPTT, with complete resolution of symptoms and no recurrence. In Case 2, a 68-year-old male with congenital hemophilia A and superimposed AHA responded positively to rituximab, showing stabilized factor VIII levels and no further bleeding episodes at a six-month follow-up. The management of AHA is complex due to its rarity and severe bleeding risks. Although corticosteroids and bypassing agents are primary treatments, rituximab is emerging as a promising therapeutic option. Current literature supports rituximab for patients with contraindications to first-line agents or poor prognosis, yet further studies are required to assess its potential as a first-line treatment. These cases emphasize the efficacy and safety of rituximab in managing AHA. Given its potential benefits, further randomized controlled trials are warranted to evaluate rituximab's role as a first-line treatment. A structured monitoring protocol is recommended to ensure safe administration and manage potential side effects associated with immunosuppressive therapy."

    "abstract": "Concizumab is an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor monoclonal antibody in development as a once-daily, subcutaneous prophylaxis for patients with haemophilia A or haemophilia B with or without inhibitors. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of concizumab in patients with haemophilia A or B without inhibitors. Here we report the results from the confirmatory analysis cutoff. This prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3a trial (explorer8) was conducted at 69 investigational sites in 31 countries. Eligible patients were male, aged 12 years or older, and had congenital severe haemophilia A or moderate or severe haemophilia B without inhibitors and with documented treatment with clotting factor concentrate in the 24 weeks before screening. The trial was paused because of non-fatal thromboembolic events in three patients (two from this trial [explorer8] and one from a related trial in haemophilia with inhibitors [explorer7; NCT04083781]) and restarted with mitigation measures, including a revised dosing regimen of subcutaneous concizumab at 1·0 mg/kg loading dose on day 1 and subsequent daily doses of 0·20 mg/kg from day 2, with options to decrease to 0·15 mg/kg, stay on 0·20 mg/kg, or increase to 0·25 mg/kg on the basis of concizumab plasma concentration measured after 4 weeks on concizumab. Patients recruited after treatment restart were randomly assigned 1:2 using an interactive web response system to receive no prophylaxis and continue on-demand clotting factor (group 1) or concizumab prophylaxis (group 2). The primary endpoints were the number of treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes for patients with haemophilia A and haemophilia B separately, assessed at the confirmatory analysis cutoff in randomly assigned patients. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. There were two additional groups containing non-randomly-assigned patients: group 3 contained patients who entered the trial before the trial pause and were receiving concizumab in the phase 2 trial (explorer5; NCT03196297), and group 4 contained patients who received previous clotting factor concentrate prophylaxis or on-demand treatment in the non-interventional trial (explorer6; NCT03741881), patients randomly assigned to groups 1 or 2 before the treatment pause, and patients from explorer5 enrolled after the treatment pause. The safety analysis set contained all patients who received concizumab. Superiority of concizumab over no prophylaxis was established if the two-sided 95% CI of the treatment ratio was less than 1 for haemophilia A and for haemophilia B. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04082429, and its extension part is ongoing. Patients were recruited between Nov 13, 2019 and Nov 30, 2021; the cutoff date for the analyses presented was July 12, 2022. 173 patients were screened, of whom 148 (86%) were randomly assigned or allocated to the four groups in the study after trial restart on Sept 30, 2020 (nine with haemophilia A and 12 with haemophilia B in group 1; 18 with haemophilia A and 24 with haemophilia B in group 2; nine with haemophilia A in group 3; and 46 with haemophilia A and 30 with haemophilia B in group 4). The estimated mean annualised bleeding rate ratio for treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes during concizumab prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis was 0·14 (95% CI 0·07-0·29; p<0·0001) for patients with haemophilia A and 0·21 (0·10-0·45; p<0·0001) for patients with haemophilia B. The most frequent adverse events in patients who received concizumab were SARS-CoV-2 infection (19 [13%] of 151 patients), an increase in fibrin D-dimers (12 [8%] patients), and upper respiratory tract infection (ten [7%] patients). There was one fatal adverse event possibly related to treatment (intra-abdominal haemorrhage in a patient from group 4 with haemophilia A with a long-standing history of hypertension). No thromboembolic events were reported between the trial restart and confirmatory analysis cutoff. Concizumab was effective in reducing the bleeding rate compared with no prophylaxis and was considered safe in patients with haemophilia A or B without inhibitors. The results of this trial suggest that concizumab has the potential to be one of the first subcutaneous treatment options for patients with haemophilia B without inhibitors. Novo Nordisk."

    "abstract": "Background & objectives Subclinical joint bleed is a matter of concern in individuals with hemophilia on prophylaxis. Ultrasonography (USG) is mostly used for the screening of subclinical bleeds in such individuals but it has its own limitations. Thus a more comprehensive technology is required for the detection of the same. This study undertook to evaluate the efficacy of infrared thermography (IRT) for detection of subclinical joint bleeds and its comparison with ultrasonography and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), considering MRI as the gold standard. Methods Forty eight asymptomatic individuals with hemophiliacs on prophylaxis and 15 healthy males as controls were recruited. IRT, USG and MRI were done in all participants included in the study. FLIR camera systems were used for the capture of thermograms of the joints in both the study groups. Results The mean of maximum temperature difference>0.5K (ΔT max >0.5K) as compared to a healthy joint was considered as significant. Subclinical bleeds were detected in 23.9, 7.29 and 27.08 per cent participants by IRT, USG and MRI respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of IRT and USG was detected to be 88.4 and 97.67 per cent, and 26.9 and 99 per cent, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions The findings of this study suggest that IRT is an effective tool for detection of subclinical joint bleeds in individuals with hemophilia and can be used for the monitoring of the joints in such individuals."

This is a single-center, comparative, observational, sequential, retrospective, and multidisciplinary study. Population pharmacokinetic models from the WAPPS-Hemo® application were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters and individualize prophylaxis. The annual rate of total and joint bleeds, joint health (Hemophilia Joint Health Score), plasma half-life and area under the curve ratios, FVIII consumption, administration frequency, and cost were analyzed. Thirty-eight adult patients with hemophilia A who switched from standard half-life FVIII to extended half-life pegylated FVIII were analyzed. Significant improvements (p < 0.05) were observed in all pharmacokinetic parameters, with plasma half-life and area under the curve improvement ratios of 1.5 and 1.9, respectively, as well as reductions in annual total and joint bleeding rates were registered. A higher number of patients with zero total (16.0 vs. 29.0) and joint bleeds (23.0 vs. 33.0) was also observed. The median reductions in administration frequency and dose/kg/week were 30.0% and 19.7%, respectively, avoiding 44.3 infusions/patient/year, resulting in savings of 20,843 €/patient/year. Furthermore, joint health improved (23.0 vs. 21.0; p = 0.017), and target joints resolved after the switch. The pharmacokinetically guided switch from standard half-life FVIII to pegylated FVIII demonstrated significant clinical benefits with reduced bleeding rates and improvements in joint health. Additionally, improvements in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed, allowing for reduced treatment burden by decreasing administration frequency, as well as lower consumption and costs."

However, patients with inherited coagulation disorders may exhibit prolonged or, in some cases, excessive bleeding requiring multiple perioperative interventions. Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited coagulopathy and often manifests via easy bruising, epistaxis, or prolonged bleeding. Hemophilia A (factor VII) and B (factor IX) are factor deficiencies that are clinically indistinguishable and managed according to severity and the required dental treatment. Other coagulopathies are rare (ie, inheritance is autosomal recessive) and may only become evident in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Current lab values and medical consultation with the patient's hematologist are imperative prior to rendering invasive dental treatment. There are a myriad of sedation and general anesthesia considerations, including risks for epistaxis with nasal instrumentation and bruising with improper patient positioning. Preoperative treatment with desmopressin or factor replacement may be required and generally should facilitate normal hemostasis. Additional therapies should be considered to help ensure adequate postoperative hemostasis, including pressure dressings, resorbable clotting materials, laser therapy, and oral rinses."

    "abstract": "The incidence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing in persons with hemophilia A (HA). Therefore, anticoagulant therapy based on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be needed, despite the bleeding risk. In case of surgery or bleeding, such patients may be concomitantly treated with emicizumab (routine prophylaxis), factor (F)VIII products, and DOAC. Their concomitant presence constitutes a hemostatic challenge. Recent international guidelines stated that data are scarce on the hemostatic balance of plasma samples from patients with HA receiving emicizumab and DOAC. The aim of this observational study was to assess the coagulation of FVIII-deficient plasma spiked with DOAC and emicizumab and to evaluate the effects of FVIII addition. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin generation (TG) using the calibrated automated thrombogram method were evaluated in aliquots of a commercial severe HA plasma supplemented with emicizumab (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL), DOAC (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng/mL of apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran) and FVIII (0%, 5%, 15%, 50%, and 100%). DOAC rapidly induced a TG decrease. Emicizumab could counter this effect only for the lowest DOAC dose. FVIII addition to the FVIII-deficient plasma containing a DOAC and emicizumab improved TG and countered the anticoagulant effect of DOAC at ≤100 ng/mL. Our findings indicate that FVIII can be safely used with emicizumab to counter the anticoagulant effect of DOAC at ≤100 ng/mL. The TG assay is an efficient tool to monitor plasma containing anti-FXa DOAC, but not dabigatran (anti-FIIa)."

To evaluate available literature reporting HJHS changes over time and assess a possible cut-off value for clinically relevant outcomes and the ideal follow-up for a meaningful score change. We conducted a literature search of studies published between 2011 and 2023 where the HJHS version 2.1 had been adopted to detect changes in joint health in patients with haemophilia. We focused on studies that assessed clinical relevance of HJHS changes, evaluated the use of cut-off values and reported a follow-up over time. Our search identified 213 publications of which 53 (25%) were deemed relevant for this review. Of these, 33 (62%) publications reported the total HJHS score and 20 (38%) reported a single joint HJHS score, while the way of reporting HJHS scores/change was highly variable. Ten publications (19%) assessed clinical relevance, but their methods of calculation differed (defining a cut-off score, measuring standardised response mean or minimal detectable change). The follow-up duration varied from 2 weeks to 8 years in these 10 studies. High variability in assessing HJHS change over time is the primary consequence of its low sensitivity, and the lack of consensus on interpretation and clinical relevance of the score. Therefore, more sensitive tools should be used alongside HJHS to better define the joint health status of patients with haemophilia."

    "abstract": "The real-world data on outcome of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors (HAI) is sparse, especially from developing countries. In a setting of inequitable healthcare opportunities for hemophilia patients, especially those with inhibitors, low-dose practices of emicizumab are emerging. In the present article, we describe our experience of managing HAI patients on low-dose emicizumab over a period of 56 months (from December 2019 to August 2024). The present study reports the response of patients with inhibitor-positive severe hemophilia A (HAI) and a high annual bleed rate to two-dose schedules of emicizumab prophylaxis. All patients with HAI were previously managed with on-demand bypassing agents (BPAs) before being shifted to emicizumab. Seven patients were treated on standard dose of 3 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks followed by once in 2 weeks, whereas 25 patients were started on low dose of 3 mg/kg once in 4 weeks with or without loading as per clinical decision. Bleed frequency, joint involvement, trough drug level and hemophilia joint health score (HJHS) were documented serially till in September 2023 (median of 16.4 months of follow-up). After September 2023, all patients were shifted to low dose of 3 mg/kg once in 4 weeks, following which 18 more patients were added, and this regimen has continued to date. Thirty-two patients were initiated on emicizumab prophylaxis between December 2019 and December 2022. The median duration of follow-up of this cohort was 16.4 months (7.7 - 27.3 months). There was a significant reduction in bleed rate and improvement in HJHS in both arms after initiation of emicizumab. During a cumulative follow-up period of 562.8 months involving the 32 patients, only one patient experienced a bleed that required treatment. At 12 months post-initiation, the median baseline HJHS improved from 9 to 0 in children who received full dose and from 12 to 4 in those who received low dose. The mean emicizumab trough level observed in September 2023 in both groups were 29.92 ± 2.53 µg/mL and 12.6 ± 3.79 µg/mL, respectively. No significant difference was noted either in treated bleeds or HJHS score between patients who received standard or low-dose emicizumab. In view of clinical equivalence, the standard-dose patients were also shifted to low dose, and 18 more patients were subsequently added to this arm since September 2023. The last date of follow-up for this analysis was 31 Aug 2024. The cost of treatment on low-dose emicizumab in India compared to on-demand BPAs modeled on a child weighing 10 kg is analyzed. Emicizumab prophylaxis even in lower doses is effective in preventing bleeds and improving joint outcome in HAI with pre-existing high bleed rate and arthropathy. This opens up an avenue for providing equity in healthcare delivery for HAI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India."

    "abstract": "Inequity in the access to effective therapies for rare diseases, such as hemophilia A, is a significant concern in resource-limited settings. Including necessary medications in the essential drug list can ensure that populations have access to safe and affordable treatments. Emicizumab, a nonfactor therapy, addresses many of the challenges associated with traditional factor replacement for hemophilia A, including frequent administration and the risk of inhibitor development. Studies in India show that emicizumab is cost-effective and clinically beneficial. The inclusion of emicizumab in the National Health Mission's (NHM) Essential Drug List (India) would improve treatment access and adherence, reduce healthcare burden, and improve outcomes for patients, particularly those with high bleeding rates and poor accessibility to care. Moreover, it will ensure the continuity of therapy for all existing patients who have been on emicizumab supported by the NHM in the last four years. This review aims to consolidate evidence regarding the current status of care and the benefits of emicizumab in India to highlight the importance of the addition of emicizumab to NHM's Essential Drug List."

    "title": "Development and internal validation of a clinical prediction model for individualized dosing of BAY 81-8973, A full-length recombinant factor VIII, in pediatric patients with haemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "As the most commonly used coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate in China, the individualized dosing prediction model of Kovaltry (BAY81-8973) is not fully investigated in pediatric patients. The prophylaxis tailored by population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model can optimize dosing regimens. This study aimed to develop PopPK models of BAY 81-8973 in pediatric patients, identify quantitative relationships of blood type (as a substitution for von Willebrand factor) on FVIII clearance and provide model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) procedures. Pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A were enrolled and PK tests were conducted. The blood samples were collected at six time point. One-stage-based activated partial thromboplastin time was used for FVIII activity. Basic demographics and key covariates (blood type and von Willebrand factor antigen) were collected. A nonlinear mixed-effect modeling (NONMEM) approach was employed to establish PopPK model. Simulations were performed to evaluate current dosing regimens and present MIPD strategies. A total of 30 pediatric patients were included in the analysis. In the final model, Fat-free mass calculated from weight, age, and height was included as a size descriptor which affect FVIII apparent volume of distribution and clearance. Both von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and blood type accounted for the interindividual variability of FVIII clearance, but only one can retain in the final model. Therefore, two PopPK models based on VWF:Ag or blood type were developed. When the VWF:Ag value is doubled, the FVIII clearance is reduced by 35 %. Compared with blood type non-O, the clearance in pediatric patients with blood type O increased by 25.9 %. Weight-based dosing without regard to age and blood type resulted in large differences in FVIII trough activity. Patient demographics, dosing information, sparse blood samples and PopPK model together with Bayesian estimate constituted the MIPD workflow. Using it, the individual parameters and optimized dosing regimen could be achieved. This is the first predictive model designed to predict individualized dosing of BAY 81-8973 in pediatric patients with Hemophilia A. These results are useful in the PK-guided prophylaxis among pediatric patients and hold great potential to improve their long-term clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Primary lung cancer with acquired hemophilia A is rare. We report a case of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) with acquired hemophilia A diagnosed by endobronchial biopsy. A 75-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to severe anemia and multiple organ failure. Hematomas, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, decreased activity of factor VIII, and the presence of serum factor VIII inhibitors led to the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A. Administration of recombinant activated factor VIII and steroid treatment resolved the coagulation abnormalities. Simultaneously, a CT scan showed a lung mass and an endobronchial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of LCNEC. Although acquired hemophilia A can cause severe bleeding symptoms, a lung cancer diagnosis by bronchoscopy was possible under appropriate treatment of acquired hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "To detect the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of coagulation factor Ⅷ (FⅧ) in adult patients with severe hemophilia A, identify the potential factors influencing FⅧ PK, and optimize the use of FⅧ in individual prophylaxis regimens. PK characteristics of FⅧ were studied in a total of 23 severe hemophilia A adults. The correlation of patients' characteristics including age, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), blood group, weight, body mass index (BMI) and <i>FⅧ</i> genotype, with FⅧ PK were evaluated. Individual prophylaxis regimens were given based on FⅧ PK parameters. The mean terminal half‑life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of FⅧ was 20.6±9.3 h, ranged from 11.47 h to 30.12 h. The age (<i>r</i> =0.580) and vWF:Ag (<i>r</i> =0.814) were significantly positively correlated with t<sub>1/2</sub> of FⅧ. The mean area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of FⅧ was 913±399 (328-1 878) IU·h/dl, and the AUC of FⅧ was positively correlated with age (<i>r</i> =0.557) and vWF:Ag (<i>r</i> =0.784). The mean residence time (MRT) of FⅧ was 24.7±12.4 (13.2-62.2) h, and the MRT of FⅧ was positively correlated with age (<i>r</i> =0.664) and vWF:Ag (<i>r</i> =0.868). The mean <i>in vivo</i> recovery (IVR) of FⅧ was 2.59±0.888 (1.5-4.29) IU/dl per IU/kg, the mean clearance (CL) of FⅧ was 3±1.58（0.97-7.18）ml/(kg·h)，and there was no significant correlation of IVR and CL with age and vWF:Ag. According to the individual PK parameters, ultra low-dose, low-dose and moderate-dose FⅧ were applied to 15, 6, 2 adults patients with severe hemophilia A for prophylaxis, respectively. There are significant individual differences in the FⅧ half-life of adult patients with severe hemophilia A. The older the patient, the higher the vWF:Ag level, and the longer the FⅧ half-life. Individual administration is required based on the FⅧ PK parameters to optimize prophylaxis treatment."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> People living with hemophilia A face challenges impacting their daily lives despite treatment innovations. Previous studies have explored perceptions and treatment experiences; however, there is a lack of an evidence-based, comprehensive model to identify concepts (clinical, physical, and psychological functioning) relevant for people with hemophilia A (PwHA). <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this qualitative study was to address the question: What is the humanistic and symptomatic experience of adolescents, adults, and children living with hemophilia A and what is the impact of hemophilia A on their quality of life? <b>Methods:</b> Participants, identified through patient associations in the UK, were male PwHA and caregivers of male PwHA receiving prophylactic treatment. Qualitative research was conducted involving semistructured telephone interviews with PwHA and caregivers between April 2020 and September 2020 in the UK. Standard analytical techniques of conceptual model development were used. <b>Results:</b> Of 30 participants, 23 were PwHA and 7 were caregivers. A conceptual model was produced describing patient experience of symptoms, physical functioning, treatment experiences, and the impact of symptoms and treatment on daily lives. Participants reported hemophilia-related symptoms, including bleeding, pain, and joint stiffness, as well as difficulties engaging with social and leisure activities. They also reported protection from bleeds provided by their treatment, relief from symptoms, and the resultant sense of normality. Concepts were broadly relevant across all age groups; however, psychological impacts were reported only by adult PwHA, and caregivers reported impacts related to outdoor activities, play, and education. Participants indicated that their ideal treatment would be delivered orally. <b>Discussion:</b> This study highlights the range of symptoms experienced by PwHA across a broad range of age groups, thus enabling the evaluation of relevant concepts across different stages of life. The research supports development of a conceptual model documenting symptoms, impacts, and treatment experience relevant to PwHA. <b>Conclusion:</b> Insights gathered through the interviews and resulting conceptual model support development of new therapies to address the physical and social challenges identified by PwHA and highlight a need for novel hemophilia A treatments that can ease treatment administration, provide adequate level of protection, and enable life to be lived normally."

Although some recommendations suggest intensifying prophylaxis in PwH with HS, no validated schedules are available. We explored the efficacy of intensive factor VIII (FVIII) replacement treatment in PwH with HS. In a randomized, open-label study, PwH with HS were randomized to receive pharmacokinetics-driven prophylaxis targeting a FVIII trough level of 8% to 12% (intensive treatment arm [ITA]) or 3% to 5% (standard treatment arm [STA]). The primary outcome was HS reduction/resolution in the 2 treatment arms. A total of 39 PwH were randomized to ITA and 36 to STA. During the study, we found a lower annual bleeding rate and a higher rate of annual bleeding rate zero in the ITA than in the STA. HS reduction/resolution was reported in 35.9% of cases in the ITA and 8.4% in the STA. In detail, in the ITA ,10.3% achieved HS reduction and 25.6% complete HS resolution, as compared to 5.6% and 2.8% in the STA. Cox regression showed that ITA was associated with HS reduction/resolution (hazard ratio: 4.75; 95% CI: 1.36-16.57; P = .014) and HS complete resolution (hazard ratio: 10.79; 95% CI: 1.38-84.45; P = .023). The analysis of the 127 joints with HS (54 elbows, 41 knees, and 32 ankles) consistently confirmed similar results. In this randomized study, we found a ∼5-fold higher rate of HS reduction/resolution and a ∼10-fold higher rate of HS resolution in the ITA than in the STA."

    "abstract": "The most significant treatment complication for patients with hemophilia A is the development of neutralizing immunoglobins (Igs) G, termed inhibitors, against factor VIII (FVIII), which prevent FVIII replacement therapy. Low titers of FVIII-specific IgMs have been identified in hemophilia A patients with and without inhibitors, as well as in healthy individuals. However, the duration and influence of IgMs on the immune response to FVIII remains unclear. To characterize the binding interactions of persistently secreted FVIII-specific IgMs in hemophilia A mice and assess their effect on IgG antibody development. Splenic-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from immunized FVIII knockout mice were isolated and purified using hybridoma technology. Binding interactions were assessed utilizing a novel fluid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and computational modeling with High Ambiguity-Driven protein-protein DOCKing to account for weak IgM binding. Sixteen porcine cross-reactive and noninhibitory FVIII-specific IgM mAbs were identified. RNA sequencing of FVIII-specific IgMs revealed 13 unique variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ)/variable and joining (VJ) sequences indicating derivation from 13 unique B cell clones. The IgMs demonstrated polyclonal and polyreactive binding to FVIII in vitro and in silico. Molecular docking studies with reconstructed IgM variable, diversity, and joining/variable and joining regions identified frequent IgM interactions with amino acid residues K376, T381, K437, R2215, or K2249 within the FVIII A2 and C2 domains. Injections of individual IgMs prior to FVIII exposure and co-injection of FVIII/IgM immune complexes did not affect de novo FVIII antibody production. Persistent FVIII-specific IgMs are polyclonal but preferentially bind the A2 and C2 domains. FVIII/IgM immune complex formation does not significantly alter inhibitor development."

    "abstract": "Recombinant porcine factor VIII (rpFVIII) is a hemostatic agent for acquired hemophilia A (AHA). Cross-reaction of auto-antibodies against rpFVIII has been reported, although no data are available in Japanese patients. This study investigated the cross-reactivity and coagulation potential of rpFVIII in plasma samples from Japanese patients with AHA. Cross-reactivity was calculated as the ratio of anti-porcine FVIII inhibitor titer (pFVIII-INH) to human FVIII inhibitor titer. Comprehensive coagulation potential was assessed by clot waveform analysis (CWA) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) in samples spiked with rpFVIII (equivalent to 200 U/kg). Nine of 16 plasma samples (56.3%) had positive pFVIII-INH, with a median cross-reactivity of 1.2%. FVIII activity (FVIII:C) was restored to > 100% in all samples upon spiking with rpFVIII, but was weakly correlated with pFVIII-INH. CWA parameters and most TGA parameters were restored to normal upon spiking with rpFVIII; correlation of these parameters with FVIII:C was similar to that observed in controls. Overall, cross-reactivity to rpFVIII in Japanese patients was similar to that reported in Caucasian patients. Our results suggest that an initial clinical dose of 200 U/kg rpFVIII could restore coagulation potential to normal, and that FVIII:C monitoring after rpFVIII administration may be more informative than pFVIII-INH before administration."

    "abstract": "In patients with hemophilia A with inhibitor (PwHA-I), emicizumab drastically reduces bleeding events. However, few studies have investigated the behavior and effects of factor X (FX) in patients who require intensive treatment with factor VIII-bypassing agents (BPA) and emicizumab. A 59-year-old man with HA-I receiving emicizumab prophylaxis was admitted to our hospital because of acute gangrenous cholecystitis. He received percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage and laparoscopic cholecystectomy along with repeated administration of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). On day 10, a large hematoma developed around the residual gallbladder. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) suggested poor effect of rFVIIa and reduced activity of emicizumab. Considering that this could be due to consumption of FX, plasma-derived FVIIa/FX agent (pdFVIIa/X) was administered, and ROTEM parameters recovered considerably. The patient was discharged on day 19 uneventfully. Plasma assays revealed that FX antigen level (FX:Ag) was 107.5% at baseline but then decreased. Administration of pdFVIIa/FX restored FX:Ag (pre/post 47.2%/125.5%). ROTEM and thrombin generation assay with in vitro addition of anti-emicizumab antibody suggested that low FX:Ag was responsible for attenuating the effect of emicizumab, and pdFVIIa/FX administration restored coagulation potentials. In PwHA-I receiving intensive treatment with rFVIIa under emicizumab prophylaxis, FX consumption might attenuate the effect of emicizumab."

The pathogenesis of FVIII inhibitor formation remains unclear. Chemokine CXCL13, a key ligand for follicular helper T cells (TFHs), in the context of inhibitor development were assessed in the present study. A total of 113 HA patients, with and without inhibitors, along with 72 healthy volunteers, were enrolled. Results demonstrated abnormally elevated levels of CXCL13 in HA patients, with a 2.0-fold increase in patients with inhibitors compared to those without. Similarly, CXCL13 levels were significantly elevated in both wild-type and HA mice with FVIII inhibitors. The proportions of circulating and splenic TFHs were markedly higher in inhibitor patients and murine models and positively correlated with CXCL13 levels. Moreover, plasma levels of B cell activating factor and the inflammatory biomarker HMGB1 were significantly increased in both human and animal inhibitor cohorts. An increased frequency of germinal center B cells was observed in splenocytes from inhibitor mice. In vitro study revealed human dermal microvascular endothelial cells undergoing immunogenic ferroptosis when conditioned with high levels of CXCL13, which was associated with down-regulation of ferroptosis suppressors SLC7A11 and GPX4, activation of the Nrf2 pathway, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species. The findings of this study suggest that CXCL13 play a pivotal role in the microenvironment of anti-FVIII antibody development. Targeting CXCL13 may offer a potential therapeutic approach for FVIII inhibitors in HA."

    "abstract": "Splice-modulating antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are precision RNA-based drugs that are becoming an established modality to treat human disease. Previously, we reported the discovery of ASOs that target a novel, putative intronic RNA structure to rescue splicing of multiple pathogenic variants of <i>F8</i> exon 16 that cause hemophilia A. However, the conventional approach to discovering splice-modulating ASOs is both laborious and expensive. Here, we describe an alternative paradigm that integrates data-driven RNA structure prediction and community science to discover splice-modulating ASOs. Using a splicing-deficient pathogenic variant of <i>F8</i> exon 16 as a model, we show that 25% of the top-scoring molecules designed in the Eterna OpenASO challenge have a statistically significant impact on enhancing exon 16 splicing. Additionally, we show that a distinct combination of ASOs designed by Eterna players can additively enhance the inclusion of the splicing-deficient exon 16 variant. Together, our data suggests that crowdsourcing designs from a community of citizen scientists may accelerate the discovery of splice-modulating ASOs with potential to treat human disease."

This study describes the demographics, diagnosis, underlying disorders, bleeding characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of 41 AHA patients together with specific case reports. Diagnosis and treatment of these patients occurred between 2005 and 2023. The median age at diagnosis was 67.8 (range: 15-93) years. Among the 41 patients, 10 (24%) cases were idiopathic, 4 (10%) were postpartum, 18 (44%) involved autoimmune diseases, and 9 (22%) involved a diagnosis of cancer. The diagnostic delay exceeded 30 days in 15 of the 41 cases (36.5%). A total of 38 of the 41 (93%) patients presented with spontaneous bleeding, with mucocutaneous bleeding being the most common presentation (23/41, 56%). Four patients experienced postpartum bleeding. Clinical remission was achieved by 100% of patients and no patients died. Hemostatic and immunosuppressive therapy is essential in AHA, and it should be started as soon as possible in patients with bleeding. However, a significant delay in diagnosis was observed in these cases. The absence of mortality is likely attributable to the management of the disease within a specialized hemostasis and thrombosis unit, which offers a clinical ward, a specialized laboratory, and a dedicated ambulatory service. The Italian Society for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis is working to secure recognition of this essential role in every hospital."

    "abstract": "Persons with hemophilia experience joint bleeding that can lead to debilitating arthropathy, most commonly seen in ankles, knees, and elbows. Arthropathy can hinder participation in daily and athletic activities. We explored how hemophilic arthropathy impacts movement patterns in walking and bilateral squatting tasks in persons with hemophilia compared to healthy controls. Persons with hemophilia and healthy controls completed walking and squatting tasks while kinematic and kinetic motion capture data were collected. The Hemophilia Joint Health Score exam was performed to measure hemophiliac arthropathy. OpenSim was used to model muscle and joint reaction forces and calculate moments and angles. Peak values were compared using Cohen's d to estimate effect sizes of hemophilia on movement parameters. Nine persons with hemophilia and eight age-matched controls were analyzed. Temporal-spatial metrics were similar between hemophilia and control groups in both tasks. In walking, persons with hemophilia had higher peak ankle dorsiflexion angles, vertical ground reaction force weight acceptance peaks, and hip extension and flexion moments compared to controls. In squatting, persons with hemophilia had lower knee extension moments, ankle joint reaction force, and knee extensor forces, but had higher hip extension moments. Temporal-spatial metric similarity between hemophilia and controls suggests that kinetic and kinematic analyses are needed to identify movement pattern differences. These data identify potential compensatory strategies at the hip that may be used by persons with hemophilia to mitigate impact on the knee and ankle. Future work will confirm these data in a larger sample size and be used to develop physical therapy strategies."

The detection of both inversions by an inverse shifting-polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR) is the first choice worldwide for the diagnosis of patients and carriers of SHA. To improve its sensitivity and reproducibility in the visualization of PCR products, we approached the IS-PCR with fluorescent capillary electrophoresis instead of agarose electrophoresis. Based on the original protocol, we modified two primers by 5'-end labeling with FAM™ fluorescent dye for the detection of the PCR products by capillary electrophoresis. Additionally, the \"fast enzymes\" <i>Bcl</i>I and T4-Ligase were incorporated for work saving in the genomic digestion and ligation reactions, respectively. Once we accomplished the standardization and verified the reproducibility of the modified IS-PCR method, we applied it for the diagnosis of a cohort of SHA patients and carriers. The modified IS-PCR by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis for PCR product detection is more sensitive than agarose electrophoresis. The method was also improved by using the new rapid enzymes to save time in the whole process."

Inadequate bleeding occurred during arthrocentesis performed on suspicion of polyarthritis. Coagulation tests revealed an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Activity of factor VIII was 5% (reference range: 70-125%), of factor IX 55% (80-130%), and of factor XII 73% (50-140%).In a genetic study, exons and adjacent intron sequences of the feline F8-gene were sequenced and compared with the reference (ENSFCAT000078256.1). While no non-synonymous variants were found in coding sequences, intron 19 revealed the variant c.6073+2 T>C. This variant likely results in splice site alteration, atypical splicing, and thus an altered mRNA for FVIII.The patient was treated symptomatically (metamizole, buprenorphine, tranexamic acid) and clinical signs improved. Chemical castration with a GnRH implant was performed at 8 and 18 months of age, whereby minor bleeding at the implantation site occurred after the second implantation. After 3.5 years, the cat lives nearly without clinical signs of bleeding.aPTT prolongation with normal PT indicated a factor deficiency.

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is associated with reduced bone mass and mineral density. Due to the rarity of the disease and the heterogeneity among the studies, the pathogenesis of bone loss is still under investigation. We studied the effects of coagulation factors on bone cells and characterized in a pilot study the osteoclastogenic potential of patients' osteoclast precursors. To evaluate the effect of coagulation factors on osteoclasts, we treated Healthy Donor-Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (HD-PBMC) with Factor VIII (FVIII), von Willebrand Factor (VWF), FVIII/VWF complex, activated Factor IX (FIXa), activated Factor X (FXa) and Thrombin (THB). FVIII, VWF, FVIII/VWF, FXa and THB treatments reduced osteoclast differentiation of HD-PBMC and VWF affected also bone resorption. Interestingly, PBMC isolated from patients with moderate/severe haemophilia showed an increased osteoclastogenic potential due to the alteration of osteoclast precursors. Moreover, increased expression of genes involved in osteoclast differentiation/activity was revealed in osteoclasts of an adult patient with moderate haemophilia. Control osteoblasts treated with the coagulation factors showed that FVIII and VWF reduced ALP positivity; the opposite effect was observed following THB treatment. Moreover, FVIII, VWF and FVIII/VWF reduced mineralization ability. These results could be important to understand how coagulation factors deficiency influences bone remodeling activity in haemophilia."

    "title": "Saliva of persons with hemophilia A triggers coagulation via extrinsic tenase complexes.",
    "abstract": "Human saliva contains extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs expose extrinsic tenase complexes of tissue factor (TF) and activated factor VII (FVIIa), and trigger blood coagulation. Here, we show that EVs exposing extrinsic tenase complexes are also present in saliva of persons with severe hemophilia A, that is, persons with FVIII deficiency. Addition of these salivary EVs to autologous FVIII-deficient blood results in FXa generation, thereby compensating for the lack of FXa generation via intrinsic tenase (FVIIIa/FIXa) complexes. Consistently, in our retrospective analysis of persons with severe hemophilia A who do not receive prophylactic FVIII substitution, oropharyngeal mucosal bleedings are infrequent and self-limited. Conversely, in saliva of persons with severe FVII deficiency, in whom oropharyngeal bleedings are prevalent, functional extrinsic tenase complexes are absent, because EVs lack FVII. Saliva of persons with severe FVII deficiency is unable to restore blood coagulation, which is because of the absence of FVII in both their saliva and blood. Picomolar levels of recombinant FVIIa can restore the coagulant potential of saliva of persons with FVII deficiency. Taken together, our findings may explain the paucity of oropharyngeal bleedings in persons with hemophilia A as well as the occurrence of such bleedings in persons with severe FVII deficiency."

    "abstract": "Despite the progress in gene editing platforms like CRISPR/Cas9 with the potential to transform the standard of care for haemophilia, the language used to explain and discuss gene editing is not aligned across the haemophilia community. Here, we present the objective and rationale for developing a clear, consistent, and globally aligned gene editing lexicon to address these communication gaps. Effectively communicating complex gene editing concepts requires a clear and consistent vocabulary. Through collaboration with a diversity of haemophilia stakeholders, our main goal is to develop an accurate, informative lexicon which avoids overpromising or highly technical terminology. Using an innovative process, representatives from several patient and scientific haemophilia organizations and select biotechnology companies will develop and refine language concepts to be tested with approximately seventy participants across the United States of America, United Kingdom, and Germany. Participants will include lived experience experts (LEEs) and haematologists. The process will be overseen by the Lexicon Steering Committee of global experts from leading scientific and patient organizations in the haemophilia and gene editing fields. Initial feedback provided a robust foundation and rationale for building clear, consistent language around gene editing. This lexicon development framework will allow for increased understanding across the haemophilia community, including the development of valid informed consent and shared decision-making materials. Results provide important building blocks for stimuli development and highlight the need for a novel gene editing lexicon. In the next phase, language stimuli will be tested with LEEs and haematologists to better understand audience preferences and help shape the final lexicon."

    "abstract": "The 24-month, prospective, non-interventional, European multicenter A-SURE study evaluated the real-world effectiveness of prophylaxis using an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) Fc fusion protein, efmoroctocog alfa (hereinafter rFVIIIFc), compared with prophylaxis using standard half-life (SHL) FVIII products in patients with hemophilia A. Primary endpoints were annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized injection frequency, and annualized factor consumption. A comparative study design unique for an observational hemophilia study was implemented to reduce potential confounding in effectiveness estimates, wherein each patient prescribed rFVIIIFc was matched with one receiving SHL FVIII. Propensity scores were used for adjustment in statistical analyses. Outcomes for all primary endpoints were significantly better in the rFVIIIFc group (n = 184) compared with the SHL FVIII group (n = 170): mean ABR 1.5 versus 2.3 (difference of -0.8; p = 0.0147); mean annualized injection frequency 114.4 versus 169.2 (difference of -54.8; p < 0.0001); and mean annualized factor consumption 243 024.2 versus 288 718.6 International Units (difference of 45 694.5; p = 0.0003). rFVIIIFc was well tolerated, with no inhibitor development. rFVIIIFc has superior prophylactic effectiveness versus SHL FVIII, providing higher bleed protection with fewer injections and lower factor consumption."

To propose recommendations to improve the comprehensive management of people with MHA. Recommendations from a Spanish panel of eight experts from public comprehensive care centres (CCCs) for people with haemophilia and over 140 people with MHA in follow-up. In a previous analysis, the panel identified the unmet needs of people with MHA and the necessity to develop new specific recommendations for their management. The panel proposed recommendations in four areas: diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and referrals. They detailed the necessary steps and procedures for the diagnosis, adding other variables to the FVIII levels like bleeding phenotype, genetic profile and joint status to specify the severity and risk classification of people with MHA. Experts proposed an algorithm with unique independent criteria to facilitate the decision to initiate prophylaxis, where the recommended FVIII levels and variables coexist for treatment decision-making. Follow-up proposals addressed periodicity, recommended tests and required visits to CCCs. For referrals, experts proposed criteria and situations considered urgent for a transfer to a CCC for haemophilia patients. The proposals agreed upon by this expert panel can contribute to update and optimize the management of people with MHA, delaying joint deterioration, pain and disabilities, and improving their quality of life."

In this article, we present data on an initial real-world evaluation of emicizumab use in Korean children with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors. This study was conducted from June 2020 to March 2024 at 4 centers in Korea. The participants were pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors who had received emicizumab treatment for over 6 months. The mean and median annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) and mean and median annual joint bleeding rates (AJBRs) were compared. Each of the 21 patients in the study received an emicizumab loading regimen of 3 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks, followed by a modified maintenance regimen of which 2 patients (9.5%) received a 1.5 mg/kg weekly dose, 3 patients (14.3%) received a 6 mg/kg dose every 4 weeks, and the remaining 16 patients (76.2%) received a 3 mg/kg dose every 2 weeks. Before emicizumab prophylaxis initiation, the mean and median ABRs for all patients were 7.04 (SD ± 5.83) and 6.52 (range 0-21.74), respectively. After receiving emicizumab treatment, the mean and mediam ABRs decreased to 0.41 and zero, respectively. Additionally, 85.7% of the patients achieved no bleeding events within 6 months of starting the treatment. These first real-world data in Korea indicate that emicizumab is effective and safe for pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors."

However, due to its increased risk for fatality, it is imperative that physicians are aware and receptive to the signs of non-accidental trauma to assist with early detection. In a similar fashion, bleeding disorders vary in their presentations and their severity. They also have the potential to occur in the setting of non-accidental trauma, further complicating the diagnosis, increasing morbidity, and mortality. Due to this, suspicion and evaluation for non-accidental trauma should be followed by a bleeding disorder work-up.

Post hoc analysis of data from the GTH-AHA-EMI study that used emicizumab for bleed protection and withheld immunosuppressive treatment during the early phase of management. Primary endpoint was the rate of clinically relevant new bleeding (CRNB) during the first 12 weeks of emicizumab prophylaxis. Forty-seven patients were enrolled. Median age was 76 years; performance status (World Health Organization performance status [WHO-PS]) was 3 or worse in 41%; Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was 5 or higher in 63%; antithrombotic drugs were reported in 34%. Rate of CRNB during 12 weeks of emicizumab prophylaxis was similar across subgroups of age, sex, WHO-PS, CCI, baseline factor VIII activity, and inhibitor titer. Patients with CRNB during the study had more severe anemia already at baseline. However, persistent severe anemia in week 4 was not related to risk of bleeding beyond this time. CRNB was associated with injury from falling in 7 of 14 patients. Adverse events grade 3 or higher were not related to baseline CCI or age but were more frequent in patients with poor WHO-PS. Emicizumab provided bleed protection regardless of age and comorbidity. Clinical baseline characteristics did not predict breakthrough bleeding under emicizumab. Poor WHO-PS at baseline was associated with severe adverse events during the study."

With advances in treatment, life expectancy and aging-associated diseases such as coronary artery disease have increased. Our primary objective is to assess for major adverse outcomes, mortality, and length of hospital stay in individuals with hemophilia presenting for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Our retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database (NIS) for 2018 to investigate the outcomes of ACS management with PCI in adults with and without hemophilia. We used ICD-10 codes to exclude patients with significant comorbidities and identify those with ACS undergoing PCI. Propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression were employed to account for over 20 baseline characteristics, mitigating confounding factors. The incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (11.0% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001), hemorrhagic stroke (10.0% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.001), and retroperitoneal hemorrhage (5.6% vs. 1.4%, p < 0.001) was significantly higher in individuals with hemophilia undergoing PCI compared to those without hemophilia. Additionally, venous thromboembolism (VTE) incidence was notably higher in the hemophilia cohort (6.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.027). The hemophilia cohort also experienced a higher mortality rate (7.1% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.037) and longer hospital stays. Patients with hemophilia undergoing PCI are at a significantly greater risk of adverse events, increased mortality, and longer hospital stays than the general population. To mitigate the risk of unfavorable outcomes, it is crucial to ensure adequate replenishment of coagulation factors and establish close collaboration between cardiologists and hematologists."

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PR and OD treatment for children with moderate or severe HA without inhibitors in China. A retrospective cost-effectiveness study was conducted on 640 HA children (373 and 267 children were on the PR and OD treatment, respectively) from January 2021 to November 2022. The Markov model was used to estimate the economic and clinical outcomes and would run for 17 yearly cycles with the initial age at 2 years. The transfer probabilities were extracted from the data of \"Hemophilia Home Care Center\" and the literature published. All patients' drug costs were collected from the data of \"Hemophilia Home Care Center\". One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted on the data to evaluate the robustness of the results. PR was consistently associated with higher overall quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with OD treatment (9.59 QALYs vs. 6.85 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PR compared with the OD treatment was calculated to be approximately US$12,151.35 (RMB¥81,778.55) per QALY gained. This amount was lower than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$38,212.74 (RMB¥257,171.71). One-way sensitivity analysis found that the results were sensitive to the cost of OD and PR treatments. This study indicated that PR is cost-effective compared with OD treatment for children with moderate or severe HA without inhibitors in China."

The only proven method to eradicate these inhibitors is via immune tolerance induction therapy, which consists of infusing factor VIII concentrates at regular intervals. This approach is effective ∼65% of the time, leaving at least a third of patients who develop inhibitors with this lifelong problem. Although emicizumab has greatly improved the quality of life of inhibitor patients, eradicating the inhibitor remains an important treatment goal. Animal models have shown the potential for gene therapy to induce tolerance. A recent abstract describing a study in humans demonstrated the potential for successful tolerance induction. This article will describe the rationale for using gene therapy to induce tolerance and provide this author's viewpoint on the importance and possible historic significance of attempting to eradicate inhibitors with this approach."

Qualitative exit interviews provide insights into patient perspectives and support the interpretation of quantitative trial data, such as patient-reported outcome measures. In the Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) of efanesoctocog alfa in participants with severe hemophilia A, exit interviews were conducted to understand pre- and post-study experiences with pain and physical functioning and to evaluate participants' treatment experiences. In XTEND-1, participants (≥12 years old) received once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis 50 IU/kg for 52 weeks (Arm A) or on-demand efanesoctocog alfa 50 IU/kg for 26 weeks followed by 26 weeks once-weekly prophylaxis (50 IU/kg; Arm B). Optional qualitative exit interviews were conducted using a semi-structured guide in a subset of participants following study completion. Interviews included open-ended questions about participants' pre- and post-study experiences with hemophilia A and targeted questions relating to improvements in patient-reported outcomes assessed during XTEND-1, including the Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults Physical Health subscale (Haem-A-QoL PH). Content validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Intensity 3a measure was also assessed, particularly the worst pain item. Exit interviews were conducted with 29 of 159 patients enrolled in XTEND-1 (mean [range] age 40 [16-73] years). Of 17 participants enrolled in Arm A, 13 (76.5%) reported a \"wearing off\" feeling with pre-study treatment, including more aches/pain, breakthrough bleeds, and limited physical activities. Joint pain was the most reported pre-study symptom (96.6%; n = 28/29), followed by a reduced ability to move without pain (89.7%, n = 26/29). Improvements following efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis in ≥1 Haem-A-QoL PH domain were reported by 89.7% (n = 26/29) of participants, with improvements in joint pain, the ability to move without pain, and painful swellings reported by at least 21 (84%) participants. Participants reported that the PROMIS Pain Intensity 3a items were relevant, clear, and easy to answer.

Current treatment of AHA involves bypassing agents or FVIII replacement therapy, yet their efficacy is limited in cases of high inhibitor titers. Emicizumab, a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody, has shown promising hemostatic effectiveness in persons with congenital hemophilia A (HA) and AHA, but a minority of patients developed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), compromising its efficacy. This study aims to characterize the development and impact of anti-emicizumab antibodies in a patient with acquired hemophilia A (AHA) who experienced reduced efficacy of emicizumab treatment. We present a comprehensive characterization of anti-emicizumab antibodies in a patient with AHA experiencing diminished emicizumab efficacy from week 10 of treatment. We developed a method for analysis of anti-emicizumab antibodies, distinguishing immunoglobulin (Ig) subclasses and IgG subtype profiling. ADAs' neutralizing activity was evaluated using a modified clotting assay. The Luminex-based assay demonstrated the presence of anti-emicizumab antibodies, confirmed through competitive analysis. We detected anti-emicizumab IgG antibodies in the patient's plasma between week 16 and 29. IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>2</sub> subclasses were identified. Longitudinal analysis showed IgG isotype antibodies against both emicizumab and FVIII. Anti-emicizumab antibodies exhibited noninhibitory activity, confirmed by a modified Bethesda assay. Moreover, no accelerated clearance of emicizumab was observed in plasma samples from the patient. This study presents the first documented case of anti-emicizumab antibodies in AHA. Our study provides insights into ADA development against emicizumab, emphasizing the need for monitoring tools. The developed method enables comprehensive evaluation of ADAs, aiding in personalized treatment strategies. These findings contribute to understanding emicizumab's immunogenicity profile in AHA, facilitating its optimized clinical use."

    "abstract": "The mainstay of treatment for persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) with severe bleeding phenotype is prophylaxis. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of native factor VIII (FVIII) imposes the need for rather frequent intravenous injections to ensure effective prophylaxis, but this represents a relevant treatment burden and is associated with suboptimal adherence to treatment. In this light, the advent of extended half-life (EHL) FVIII molecules has improved prophylaxis feasibility and outcomes by favoring treatment individualization and tailoring protection according to specific clinical and nonclinical needs. Different technologies have been used to enhance FVIII PK properties including Fc-fusion and conjugation with polyethylene glycol. Data from clinical development programs for such molecules, together with growing real-world experience, have shown numerous benefits related to the use of EHL FVIII in PwHA. Recently a new class of ultra-long-acting EHL FVIII has been developed to further improve protection against bleeding episodes and achieve the ambitious goal of providing PwHA with hemostatic protection in the nonhemophilia range over longer time periods, hence ensuring very low bleeding rates and improving joint health and quality of life. In this review, the achievements and perspectives of replacement therapies for PwHA are summarized and discussed."

The underlying cause of AHA is unclear but can present postpartum. Very few cases have reported instances of AHA coexisting with other hematological disorders, such as sickle cell trait (SCT). Although rare and no direct correlation between the two, critical situations involving intractable bleeding can intensify the severity of these disorders. A 31-year-old pregnant female with a medical history significant for SCT presented to the hospital for a C-section. Shortly after the procedure she experienced intractable bleeding from multiple sites. Initial lab work yielded an isolated increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Further investigation showed abnormal mixing studies, reduced factor VIII activity and the presence of factor VIII antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with postpartum AHA (PAH) and treated with activated Factor VII and prednisone. PAH is an uncommon bleeding disorder that commonly occurs one to four months postpartum and presents as excessive bleeding elevated aPTT, abnormal mixing studies, and reduced factor VIII levels with abnormally high inhibitor levels. Despite an unknown identifiable etiology, treatment hinges upon establishing hemostasis and eradicating the aberrant generated factor VIII inhibitors. The association of AHA and other hematological disorders is not yet elucidated."

Psychometric analyses were performed according to an a priori analysis plan using data collected in a cross-sectional web survey and a final measure was generated. Interviews with four clinical experts, 25 CwH ages 8 to <12 years, and 25 caregivers of CwH <12 years were conducted. Concepts endorsed by ≥10% of CwH and caregivers were: adherence, ease of use, emotional impacts, physical impacts, treatment concerns, and interference with daily life. Cognitive debriefing assessments were conducted to ensure participant understanding and item relevance. Caregivers found the measure to be understandable, comprehensive, and relevant. However, several issues with CwH completing the measure were identified and it was decided to only develop an observer-reported outcome version. Data for psychometric validation was collected in a web survey (N = 187). Item reduction dropped 12 items. Factor analysis generated a single, 7-item, internally consistent (α = .855) factor, which consisted of items covering all relevant a priori concepts.

To investigate adherence and QoL among PWB and explore the correlation between treatment adherence and QoL in adult patients with haemophilia A (HA), haemophilia B (HB) and Von Willebrand disease (vWD) in Denmark. This survey used disease-specific patient-reported questionnaires: Veritas-PRO and Veritas-PRN to measure adherence, and Haemo-A-QoL and VWD-QoL to assess QoL. Responses were obtained from 149 patients with HA, 32 with HB and 118 with vWD. Adherence was reported by 87.1% of patients on prophylaxis and 71.2% of patients treated on demand, according to Veritas-PRO and Veritas-PRN cut-off scores. High QoL was generally reported, decreasing with age in HA and HB, but not in vWD. Danish patients with HA, HB and vWD reported high QoL and high adherence to prescribed treatments. There was no correlation between treatment adherence and QoL among the different patient groups. These findings highlight the need for further research to better understand adherence behaviours and identify opportunities to further improve QoL in PWB."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a congenital coagulopathy characterized by a deficiency of coagulation factors and the development of haematomas and haemarthrosis, either spontaneously or after minor trauma. Recurrent joint hemorrhage in hemophilia patients leads to progressive and degenerative arthropathy, which affects around 90% of patients with severe disease and contributes significantly to disease morbidity. Positive diagnosis is based on biology. Imaging, particularly MRI, plays an essential role in assessing the evolution and complications, especially osteoarticular complications. We report 2 cases of severe hemophilia A, who presented with almost identical clinical and radiological symptoms. The patients developed severe arthropathy with a course marked by recurrences of haemarthrosis."

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is reported by between 30 and 71% of people with haemophilia (PWH). Exercise is shown to be effective for pain management in other arthritides, but it remains unclear if such an approach is effective or acceptable to PWH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a telerehabilitation exercise intervention for PWH living with chronic pain. This was a multisite, non-randomised, pre-post feasibility design, with a nested qualitative study. People with severe haemophilia > 18 years, living with chronic pain, were recruited. The intervention comprised 12 low-impact/moderate intensity, individualised exercise sessions and 3 knowledge-sharing and discussion sessions. Primary objectives assessed according to predefined progression criteria were as follows: (a) recruitment rate (5 participants enrolled per site over 8 weeks), (b) adherence (≥ 75% participants would adhere to ≥ 75% of sessions), (c) follow-up rate (≥ 75% completion of self-reported measures), (d) fidelity (intervention delivered as described in protocol) and (e) safety (≤ 30% participants would report adverse events). Acceptability was evaluated from thematic analysis of post-intervention participant interviews. Preliminary evaluation of self-reported pain, function and quality of life (QoL) was a secondary objective. Results were reported using descriptive statistics integrated with qualitative findings. Ten PWH were recruited and completed the intervention. Nine agreed to be interviewed post intervention. Attendance at individual sessions was 84.5% compared to 52.1% for the group sessions. Outcome measures were successfully completed for 100% at baseline, 70% at intervention end and 60% at 3-month follow-up. No serious adverse events were recorded. Group median values in outcome measures (pain, function, QoL) showed minimal change post intervention. Participant interviews highlighted high levels of enjoyment, confidence in continuing exercises independently and positive views of virtual delivery and condition-specific exercise. Recruitment rate and safety met the predefined progression criteria. Fidelity partially met the progression criteria, but the follow-up rate for self-reported measures did not. The study was acceptable to both participants and physiotherapists. Further intervention development is needed to review approaches to outcome measure collection and refine the usefulness of the knowledge-sharing sessions. The study was prospectively registered on 9 July 2021: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN 17454597."

    "abstract": "This real-world analysis described the Hemophilia A (HA) population in Italy, evaluating drug utilization and consumption of factor VIII (FVIII) products of patients under prophylaxis and on-demand therapy. From Jan-2017 to Jun-2022, male patients with HA were identified through prescriptions of FVIII products [extended half-life FVIII, standard half-life recombinant FVIII, and plasma-derived FVIII (EHL FVIII, SHL rFVIII, and pdFVIII, respectively)], or emicizumab or FVIII plus von Willebrand factor or HA-related hospitalization using administrative flows of Italian healthcare entities. Patients on treatment with FVIII products during 2021-2022 were stratified by treatment regimen (prophylaxis/on-demand). The mean annual consumption expressed in International Units (IU) of EHL FVIII and SHL FVIII in patients treated during 2021-2022 having at least 12-month follow-up were assessed. Among included HA patients, 145 (39.5%) received EHL FVIII and 222 (60.5%) SHL FVIII. Of 165 patients on prophylaxis, 105 (64%) received an EHL FVIII and 60 (36%) an SHL FVIII. The mean annual consumption of FVIII was 336,700 IU (median 319,000 IU) for EHL FVIII and 440,267 IU (median 360,500 IU) for SHL FVIII. Specifically, for patients on EHL FVIII, the most common drugs were efmoroctocog alfa (N = 51) and damoctocog alfa pegol (N = 50), followed by turoctocog alfa pegol (N = 25) and rurioctocog alfa pegol (N = 19). Of 702 HA patients initially treated with FVIII products, 74 (10.5%) switched to emicizumab during follow-up. These findings revealed an extensive use of EHL FVIII products, suggesting growing efforts from clinicians to optimize prophylactic strategies and achieve better bleeding protection."

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for studies of adult males with severe or moderately severe HA or HB who received AAV-based gene therapy. Annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized infusion rate (AIR), total factor use, factor levels, and adverse events (AEs) were extracted. Eight HA trials representing 7 gene therapies and 211 patients and 12 HB trials representing 9 gene therapies and 184 patients were included. For HA, gene therapy resulted in an annualized decrease of 7.58 bleeding events (95% confidence interval [CI], -11.50 to -3.67) and 117.2 factor infusions (95% CI, -151.86 to -82.53) compared with before gene therapy. Factor VIII level at 12 months ranged from 10.4 to 70.31 IU/mL by 1-stage assay. HB gene therapies were associated with an annualized decrease of 5.64 bleeding events (95% CI, -8.61 to -2.68) and 58.92 factor infusions (95% CI, -68.19 to -49.65). Mean factor IX level at 12 months was 28.72 IU/mL (95% CI, 18.78-38.66). Factor expression was more durable for HB than HA; factor IX levels remained at 95.7% of their peak whereas factor VIII levels fell to 55.8% of their peak at 24 months. The pooled percentage of patients experiencing a serious AE was 19% (10%-31%) and 21% (10%-37%) for HA and HB gene therapies, respectively. No thrombosis or inhibitor formation was reported. AAV-based gene therapies for both HA and HB demonstrated significant reductions in ABR, AIR, and factor use."

    "title": "A Comparative Analysis of the Bleeding Profile and Quality of Life Among Women With Hemophilia Genotype Compared to Other Bleeding Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Women with bleeding disorders continue to be underdiagnosed as well as undertreated. Women with bleeding disorders include those with genotype for hemophilia (traditionally named hemophilia carriers), von Willebrand disease (VWD), platelet function disorders, and rare bleeding disorders. Among these women, the carriers of hemophilia are usually considered asymptomatic. The present study compares the bleeding profile and quality of life (QOL) of women and girls with hemophilia and compares it to those diagnosed with VWD and rare bleeding disorders. Methods The present study is part of a prospective observational study (August 2023-July 2028) done on women and girls >12 years in two groups. Group 1 was mothers, sisters, or daughters of patients with hemophilia A who were proven carriers. Group 2 was girls and women registered at our center as following bleeding symptoms and diagnosed as either suffering from VWD or rare bleeding disorders. The bleeding profile was assessed by 1:1 interview using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Bleeding Assessment Tool (BAT). Health-related QOL (HRQOL) was assessed using the EuroQOL five dimension <i>(</i>EQ5D5L) questionnaire. Results The baseline data collected in the first six months of this prospective study is being presented here. At the time of submission, the center caters to 970 patients with hemophilia and inherited bleeding disorders. Eighty girls (post pubertal) and women with either obligate carrier status for hemophilia (n=68) or a previously diagnosed bleeding disorder (10 VWD, one afibrinogenemia, one factor VII deficiency) were enrolled. The median age of Group 1 was 35 years (25-70 years), whereas that of Group 2 was 15.5 years (13-23 years). In Group 1 (women and girls with hemophilia (WGH)), 58 and 10 were carriers of hemophilia A and B, respectively. Additionally, 83% of WGH had more than one family member with bleeding disorder, whereas 75% of Group 2 had a positive family history. The number of family members with the same disorder ranged from 0-4. Among 68 hemophilia carrier women, 20 reported bleeding symptoms (29.4%), of which 18 reported menorrhagia, one antepartum hemorrhage, and one post-partum hemorrhage and two had joint/muscle bleeds and one each had ENT and gastrointestinal bleeding. Three of them were admitted for treatment of excessive bleeding and treated with plasma/red cells. Three women reported gynecological procedures for excessive bleeding, one was on treatment for ovarian cysts, and four received packed red cells after delivery. The BAT score above 6 was reported only in 10% of WGH. Eighteen patients had undergone a surgical procedure in their life, and three of these women required a transfusion during surgery. Only one woman reported similar complaints in her daughter. The comparative analysis of HRQOL showed a significantly worse score for Group 1 in EQ5D5L domains for pain and anxiety/depression compared to that of Group 2. Conclusions A significant proportion of previously asymptomatic women with hemophilia carrier status were recognized to have significant bleeding tendencies. The QOL of these carriers is comparable to girls with VWD and rare bleeding disorders and requires special attention."

He was diagnosed with hemophilia A at the age of three years old, and was also infected with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He complained of chest pain at home and was brought to our institute and diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. Concerned about the risk of bleeding, coronary artery bypass grafting was selected to avoid permanent administration of antiplatelet agents. Although there were concerns about bleeding caused by various coagulation factor abnormalities due to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, we could accurately assess the coagulation factors by using thromboelastography and replenishing them in appropriate amounts. The operation was performed safely as usual and successfully finished."

The evolving and increasingly complex treatment landscape of haemophilia management has augmented the need and desire for SDM between patients and their healthcare team. SDM tools have been used in other chronic conditions and can be an effective form of education for patients and clinicians. The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) partnered with people with haemophilia (PWH), patient advocacy groups, and healthcare practitioners to form an expert working group to develop an educational tool for PWH and their caregivers. The primary objectives included educating PWH on the available prophylactic treatments and facilitating discussion between PWH and their healthcare team. The tool was proposed and developed by the expert working group, workshopped at conference round tables, and evaluated in two focus groups. The interactive WFH SDM Tool guides users through the SDM treatment journey and provides an opportunity for reflection on current disease impact and treatment preferences, educational fact sheets and videos, and a comparison between treatment classes. Two forms of the SDM Tool are available: an online platform with a summary page that may be printed and shared and a printable workbook. All evidence in the tool is based on the prescribing information or phase III clinical trial publications. The Tool will be updated twice each year. The WFH SDM Tool is the first available resource that translates published guidance on SDM in haemophilia into a practical, user-friendly tool aimed at facilitating patient-centred treatment decisions."

    "abstract": "In Thailand, an upper-middle-income country, managing haemophilia A (HA) with inhibitors poses significant challenges, often necessitating bypassing agents (BPAs) for bleeding control. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of emicizumab, a novel prophylactic agent, as an alternative to both episodic and prophylactic BPA treatments from a societal perspective. A Markov model was employed to estimate the lifetime societal costs and outcomes of emicizumab prophylaxis for HA patients with inhibitors. Treatment efficacy, cost, and epidemiological data were obtained through a comprehensive literature review and incorporated into the model. A 5-year budget impact analysis complemented the cost-utility analysis, with a 3% annual discount rate applied to future costs and outcomes. In the base-case scenario, emicizumab prophylaxis in HA patients aged 2 years and above demonstrated superior cost-effectiveness, yielding 18.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient over a lifetime and resulting in cost savings of 138 million Thai Baht (THB) compared to BPA prophylaxis. Compared to episodic BPA treatment, emicizumab yielded 30.5 QALYs and saved 25 million THB per patient. The 5-year budget impact was projected at 1775 million THB. Emicizumab offers a cost-saving approach for HA treatment with inhibitors in Thailand, promising significant health benefits and budgetary savings. This supports its potential inclusion in Thailand's National List of Essential Medicines to enhance haemophilia care access. Managing haemophilia A (HA) with inhibitors in Thailand, an upper-middle-income country, faces challenges due to limited access to effective treatments or newer drugs for bleeding management. Emicizumab prophylaxis found to as a cost-effective and viable alternative to traditional treatments, effectively preventing bleeding in Thai HA patients over 2 years old with inhibitors. Demonstrating improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs, emicizumab prophylaxis outperforms episodic BPA treatments, positioning it as a superior treatment option for HA patients with inhibitors in Thailand."

    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that haemophilia affects women and girls, yet current testing recommendations for factor level and genetic testing vary and do not universally incorporate updated research. Canadian parents have expressed frustration at inconsistent recommendations and reported instances where delayed testing led to missed diagnosis and preventable bleeding. Study aim was to explore and describe the practice of haemophilia-related testing of young girls in Canada. A mixed methods study was carried out with two populations: (1) Nurses working in haemophilia care completed a survey regarding the current testing recommendations of their Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC), (2) Parents of obligate or potential haemophilia carriers completed a structured interview with questions about their family experience of haemophilia and testing decisions for daughters. Twenty-six survey responses were received and showed wide variation in the usual recommendations of Canadian HTCs. Different factor level testing recommendations may be given to obligate and potential carriers despite no difference in bleeding risk. Only a minority of HTCs currently recommend an early baseline factor level (< 10 years) to obligate carriers (27%) or potential carriers (15%). For genetic testing of potential carriers, 70% of HTC would approve a family request for genetic testing of a minor with specific conditions. The majority of parents interviewed felt dissatisfied with their testing experience (58%) and highlighted many issues related to delayed testing recommendations. Updated, nationally affirmed testing recommendations are needed that align with research on bleeding in women and girls affected by haemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked bleeding disorder diagnosed by a deficiency in factor VIII (FVIII). For severe HA (SHA), prophylaxis clotting factor concentrates (CFC) has become the standard of care; however, it imparts a high treatment burden and typically results in an annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 2-6. Emicizumab, a subcutaneously administered FVIII substitute, has become the de facto standard-of-care prophylaxis for children with SHA in many countries. Previous clinical trials of emicizumab have assessed ABR in patients greater than 12 years without inhibitors, and in children less than 12 years with inhibitors; however, there is little information published regarding the ABR of emicizumab compared to CFC in non-inhibitor SHA children. Using a retrospective electronic medical record chart review, we conducted a self-control analysis of 15 patients less than 12 years of age during equivalent periods of CFC versus emicizumab prophylaxis. The mean ABR on CFC and emicizumab was 1.79 and 1.13 (p = .092), respectively, with a substantially decreased rate of joint bleeds (CFC 0.94; emicizumab 0.33; p = .001) and spontaneous bleeds (CFC 0.79; emicizumab 0.23; p = .008). No safety events were recorded for patients while administering emicizumab. The mean annual cost of CFC prophylaxis was $515,340 (SD $199,540), compared to $328,410 (SD $137,230) for emicizumab prophylaxis (p < .001). Emicizumab resulted in an improved ABR compared to CFC, especially for joint and spontaneous bleeds, had fewer administration complications, and was substantially less expensive compared to CFC prophylaxis; however, more research is necessary for a complete understanding of the effect of emicizumab on joint health and muscle bleeds."

To address the real-world implications of the FVIII mimetic antibody, emicizumab, and the role of IST, we retrospectively collected de-identified data on 62 patients with AHA who were treated off-label with emicizumab for a median of 10 weeks at 12 US-based hemophilia treatment centers. Most patients (95.2%) had acute bleeding at diagnosis, and 62.9% had partial or no control of bleeds despite the use of hemostatic agents at the time emicizumab was started. The main reason for initiating emicizumab was outpatient bleeding prophylaxis. After initiation of emicizumab, 87.1% had no additional bleeds. There were 6 breakthrough bleeds (2 spontaneous) in 5 patients and no fatal bleeding events during maintenance emicizumab treatment. The mean breakthrough bleed rate per patient-week was 0.02 (95% confidence interval, 0.0-0.03) during the first 12 weeks of emicizumab for the 55 patients with at least 12 weeks of follow-up. Of these patients, 92.7% received IST and 74.5% were prescribed rituximab-based regimens. Complete resolution of inhibitor and normalization of FVIII levels occurred in 56% overall and in 63% of the patients treated with rituximab. Overall, the median time to discontinuation of emicizumab and IST was 18 weeks. Two patients had thrombotic events while on emicizumab, but no adverse events were attributed to emicizumab and there were no infections attributed to IST. Emicizumab provides effective outpatient bleeding prophylaxis for AHA, and concurrent IST may further mitigate bleeding."

Although antiviral therapy clears HCV and reduces end-stage liver disease (ESLD), it may not reverse cirrhosis or prevent hepatocellular cancer (HCC). This was a retrospective cohort study of 121 men with hemophilia and HCV infection cared for at the Hemophilia Center of Western Pennsylvania to determine the incidence and predictors of ESLD and HCC. ESLD and HCC predictors were analyzed using Fisher exact test, and HCV-associated outcomes by Kaplan-Meier time-to-event and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. At a mean 54 years (36-80) duration of HCV, ESLD occurred in 24 (19.8%), 0.365 per 100 person-years (py); and HCC in 7 (5.8%), 0.106 per 100 py. All 46 (38.0%) alive when HCV antiviral therapy became available, received it. Overall, 31 (25.6%) were HIV+. The leading causes of death were ESLD in 11 (32.3%), bleeding in 9 (26.5%), and HCC in 6 (17.6%). Major risk factors for ESLD included platelets <100 × 103/μL (odds ratio [OR], 6.009; P = .012) and HIV infection (OR, 3.883; P = .001). The major predictors of HCC were ESLD (OR, 11.476; P = .003) and platelets <100 000/μL (OR, 6.159; P = .014). No antiviral-treated patient developed ESLD, P = .001. For men with hemophilia, the sequelae of chronic HCV infection were significant. The major risk factors for ESLD were platelets <100 000/μL and HIV infection.

Clinical studies aimed at addressing these issues have been conducted in Japan as well, including a multicenter study to determine factors involved in inhibitor development. Drug development has also progressed: several clotting factor products with extended half-life and non-clotting factor therapies have been introduced in quick succession. Anti-FIX/FX bispecific antibody in particular has a long half-life when administered subcutaneously and controls bleeding in patients with hemophilia A. Anti-antithrombin therapy and anti-TFPI monoclonal antibody products that work by rebalancing coagulation have also been developed.

For diseases with treatments that were Food and Drug Administration approved between 2019 and 2023, annual direct and indirect economic burden and characteristics of each disease were extracted from peer-reviewed literature. ICER's shared savings methodology was applied 2 ways: 50/50 shared savings and $150 000 cost-offset cap. The primary outcome was the difference in eligible cost savings provided by a hypothetical disease cure under ICER's 2 shared savings methods. Characteristics of diseases most impacted by these 2 methods were evaluated descriptively. Food and Drug Administration approved 260 therapies for 89 unique diseases between 2019 and 2023. Shared savings reduced value of a hypothetical cure for hemophilia A most (50/50 method: -$367 670 per year; cap method: -$585 340 per year), followed by acute hepatic porphyria (50/50 method: -$333 948; cap method: -$517 896) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (50/50 method: -$291 997; cap method: -$433 993). Compared with diseases with annual burdens <$150 000, those ≥$150 000 had earlier disease onset by 22.0 years (age 12.3 vs 34.3), lower life expectancy by 10.6 years (55.8 vs 66.4 years), and lower disease prevalence (4.7 vs 1981.5 per 100 000). Shared savings' impact on health-benefit price benchmarks was projected to be larger for diseases with shorter life expectancy (ρ = -0.319; p =.005), worse quality of life (ρ = -0.263; P =.020), and lower prevalence (ρ = -0.418; P < .001).

    "title": "A single-center study of patients with rare isolated acquired clotting factor deficiencies other than acquired hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Isolated acquired clotting factor deficiencies (ACFDs) are mainly caused by the existence of anti-factor antibodies or adsorption of clotting factors onto substances such as amyloid. Besides acquired factor (F)VIII deficiency (acquired hemophilia A), the remaining factor deficiencies are rare and diverse, posing challenges in both diagnosis and management. To describe different features of isolated ACFDs to improve our understanding of these diseases and provide practical recommendations for their management. Clinical characteristics of patients with isolated acquired FII, FV, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, FXIII, and von Willebrand factor deficiencies were collected from a single center between July 1997 and December 2021 and analyzed retrospectively. A total of 54 rare isolated ACFD patients were enrolled in our study, mainly including 20 acquired FV deficiency patients and 16 acquired FX deficiency patients. The median age at diagnosis of all rare isolated ACFD patients was 55 years. The median time to diagnose all rare isolated ACFD patients was 60 days. Ten (18.5%) rare isolated ACFD patients had no bleeding and 2 (3.7%) rare isolated ACFD patients showed venous thromboembolism. Hemostatic treatment was applied to 41 (41/54; 75.9%) rare isolated ACFD patients. Thirty-seven (68.5%) rare isolated ACFD patients received immunosuppressive therapy, and 10 (18.5%) rare isolated ACFD patients received chemotherapy targeting primary diseases. Twenty-two (61.9%) rare isolated ACFD patients achieved complete remission, and 9 (21.4%) rare isolated ACFD patients died. Rare isolated ACFDs are underestimated, associated with delayed diagnosis, and lack effective therapy. Clinicians should raise awareness for recognizing and managing rare isolated ACFD patients to avoid morbidity and mortality."

    "title": "Biological Barriers for Drug Delivery and Development of Innovative Therapeutic Approaches in HIV, Pancreatic Cancer, and Hemophilia A/B.",
    "abstract": "Biological barriers remain a major obstacle for the development of innovative therapeutics. Depending on a disease's pathophysiology, the involved tissues, cell populations, and cellular components, drugs often have to overcome several biological barriers to reach their target cells and become effective in a specific cellular compartment. Human biological barriers are incredibly diverse and include multiple layers of protection and obstruction. Importantly, biological barriers are not only found at the organ/tissue level, but also include cellular structures such as the outer plasma membrane, the endolysosomal machinery, and the nuclear envelope. Nowadays, clinicians have access to a broad arsenal of therapeutics ranging from chemically synthesized small molecules, biologicals including recombinant proteins (such as monoclonal antibodies and hormones), nucleic-acid-based therapeutics, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), to modern viral-vector-mediated gene therapy. In the past decade, the therapeutic landscape has been changing rapidly, giving rise to a multitude of innovative therapy approaches. In 2018, the FDA approval of patisiran paved the way for small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to become a novel class of nucleic-acid-based therapeutics, which-upon effective drug delivery to their target cells-allow to elegantly regulate the post-transcriptional gene expression. The recent approvals of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparvovec for the treatment of hemophilia A and B, respectively, mark the breakthrough of viral-vector-based gene therapy as a new tool to cure disease. A multitude of highly innovative medicines and drug delivery methods including mRNA-based cancer vaccines and exosome-targeted therapy is on the verge of entering the market and changing the treatment landscape for a broad range of conditions. In this review, we provide insights into three different disease entities, which are clinically, scientifically, and socioeconomically impactful and have given rise to many technological advancements: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a predominant infectious disease, pancreatic carcinoma as one of the most lethal solid cancers, and hemophilia A/B as a hereditary genetic disorder. Our primary objective is to highlight the overarching principles of biological barriers that can be identified across different disease areas. Our second goal is to showcase which therapeutic approaches designed to cross disease-specific biological barriers have been promising in effectively treating disease. In this context, we will exemplify how the right selection of the drug category and delivery vehicle, mode of administration, and therapeutic target(s) can help overcome various biological barriers to prevent, treat, and cure disease."

    "title": "Biomarkers Involved in the Pathogenesis of Hemophilic Arthropathy.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia, which is a rare disease, results from congenital deficiencies of coagulation factors VIII and IX, respectively, leading to spontaneous bleeding into joints, resulting in hemophilic arthropathy (HA). HA involves complex processes, including synovial proliferation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Despite ongoing research, factors contributing to HA progression, especially in adults with severe HA experiencing joint pain, remain unclear. Blood markers, particularly collagen-related ones, have been explored to assess joint health in hemophilia. For example, markers like CTX-I and CTX-II reflect bone and cartilage turnover, respectively. Studies indicate elevated levels of certain markers post-bleeding episodes, suggesting joint health changes. However, longitudinal studies on collagen turnover and basement membrane or endothelial cell markers in relation to joint outcomes, particularly during painful episodes, are scarce. Given the role of the CX3CL1/CX3XR1 axis in arthritis, other studies investigate its involvement in HA. The importance of different inflammatory and bone damage biomarkers should be assessed, alongside articular cartilage and synovial membrane morphology, aiming to enhance understanding of hemophilic arthropathy progression."

    "title": "The prevalence of Hemophilia A in males in Africa: evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder characterized by reduced or absent coagulation factor (F) VIII activity. The empirical evidence on the prevalence of HA in Africa has reported inconsistent findings and seems to present such a wide range of prevalence that it is hard to swiftly ascertain its average extent. Hence, this review aimed to pool the results of primary studies reporting the prevalence of HA into a single estimate in the region. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles published in EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Observational studies revealing the prevalence of HA in Africa between 2010 and 2023 were incorporated. We assessed the quality of each study using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment tool. The prevalence of HA was estimated as the cases (the sample size) per 100,000 population multiplied by 1000. To produce the pooled estimate, Der Simonian random-effects models were computed with Metaprop on the STATA command. The studies' heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared (I<sup>2</sup>) value test and the Galbraith plot. A funnel plot was conducted to evaluate publication bias. Of the 337 studies accessed, we included 15 that fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The random-effect model meta-analysis demonstrated the overall pooled prevalence of HA was 6.82 cases per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 5.16, 8.48) with heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00%, p < 0.001). This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that HA is an alarming problem that may pose a future threat to public health in Africa. Given the detrimental effects of the disease on health and the complications involved, we recommended that African regions increase patient access to factor VIII medication, improve carrier detection rates, and take the initiative toward the development and access to gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Blood coagulation factor (F)VIII functions as a cofactor in the tenase complex responsible for phospholipid-dependent FIXa-mediated activation of FX in plasma. Congenital defect of FVIII causes severe bleeding disorder, hemophilia (H) A. Intravenous FVIII replacement therapy is the gold standard therapy in patients with HA (PwHA) but requirement for frequent dosing of FVIII owing to pharmacokinetics burdens PwHA a lot. Efanesoctocog alfa is a new class of recombinant FVIII and has the ability to overcome conceivable unmet needs in treatment for PwHA. Efanesoctocog alfa is a B domain-deleted single-chain fusion FVIII connected to the Fc-region of human immunoglobulin G1, D'D3-fragment of von Willebrand factor (VWF), and unstructured hydrophilic recombinant polypeptides (XTEN). Owing to its novel design, it can function independently of endogenous VWF and elicits 2 to 4 times longer half-life compared to other existing FVIII products. The prolonged half-life contributes to maintain high level of FVIII activity for most of the week and has led to excellent hemostatic effect by once-weekly administration in phase 3 clinical trials. Efanesoctocog alfa with outstanding pharmacological properties, well tolerated in the clinical trials, is a promising FVIII therapy for PwHA. Future studies should include long-term safety, especially in previously untreated patients."

    "abstract": "In 2022-2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved 2 novel gene therapies, valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparavovec, for hemophilia A and B, respectively. These one-time-administered gene therapies have been marketed at prices that create financial challenges for payers and patients. Understanding the magnitude and uncertainties around the long-term value of these therapies and how they can potentially relate to managed care practices is of high interest to the payer and patient community. To conduct a systematic review of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) studies to assess (1) the long-term value of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and etranacogene dezaparavovec and (2) the relevance and validity of the underlying data and assumptions used in the CEA models and discuss how they relate to the challenges identified for CEAs of gene therapies. A systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies of novel hemophilia A and B gene therapy was conducted. PubMed and Embase were searched for published studies from inception to January 12, 2024. Original research articles published in English that conducted a CEA on gene therapy treatments for hemophilia A and B, with a comparison of incremental costs and health effects, were considered. Critical appraisal of the quality of reporting and the underlying modeling assumptions were conducted to assess the relevance and validity of the results. Two hundred thirty-eight studies were identified, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. Three studies were conducted from a US health care perspective and 1 from a Dutch societal perspective. Despite the high upfront costs of the gene therapies, all included studies' (3 hemophilia A and 1 hemophilia B) modeled results showed that gene therapies had lower overall costs and better health outcomes compared with factor concentrate replacement therapies and emicizumab. The results were driven by the assumption that gene therapies will have a durable effect of at least 10 years and offset the high cost of the current standard of care. The modeled health improvements varied substantially across studies, showing that the long-term value is sensitive to varying clinical and economic assumptions. The novel hemophilia gene therapy treatments can potentially be a cost-effective use of treatment resources if the treatment effects are durable over time. To reduce the risk for payers while still facilitating patient access, outcomes-based agreements similar to what has recently been proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for sickle-cell therapies are well supported."

Emicizumab is a novel therapeutic drug which is the first and only non-factor replacement agent licensed for use in people with HA. Pediatric patients aged 1 mo to 12 y with severe HA and frequent / life threatening bleeding events, with or without coagulation protein factor VIII inhibitors were enrolled (n = 18) in this observational pre-post study. Patients were switched from therapy involving on-demand or prophylactic factor VIII/bypassing agents/immune tolerance induction to emicizumab prophylaxis and followed up for 52 wk. One year before initiating emicizumab, a total of 229 bleeding events occurred among the enrolled children. After emicizumab prophylaxis, 5 patients had one episode of bleeding event each with a mean bleeding duration of 1.2 d in one year. The mean annualized bleeding rate significantly reduced from 12.7 ± 8.61 events pre-emicizumab prophylaxis to 0.28 ± 0.46 events post-emicizumab prophylaxis (p < 0.001). Out of the total cohort (n = 18), 72.2% of patients (n = 13) had no bleeding events (95% Confidence interval: 46.4-89.3) while on emicizumab. The mean annualized joint bleeding rate reduced from 9.72 ± 7.44 to 0.17 ± 0.38 (p < 0.001). The target joint resolution was 100% and no adverse events were noted. Emicizumab was found to be effective and safe as a prophylactic agent for the treatment of severe HA with and without factor VIII inhibitors. Emicizumab prophylaxis can optimize treatment outcomes and promote a better quality of life in children with severe HA."

This review provides an in-depth exploration of AHA, covering its epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, complications, and treatment strategies, focusing on recent advancements. AHA can manifest in both men and women with no prior bleeding history. The annual incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 case per million individuals in the general population. The incidence increases significantly with age: the incidence among individuals aged 60 years or older is approximately 3 to 4 cases per million individuals per year. Typically, patients present with an acquired bleeding disorder that is characterized by an isolated, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time stemming from FVIII deficiency. Diagnosis relies on the detection of neutralizing antibodies using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay. Hemostatic control strategies involve bypassing agents like recombinant activated factor VII, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant porcine FVIII for bleeding patients. Emicizumab, a novel bypassing agent, exhibits several potential advantages. In the realm of immunosuppressive treatment for inhibitor eradication, the CyDRi regimen emerged as a remarkable advancement, significantly enhancing the outlook for the management of AHA even in the elderly frail population."

To provide real-world descriptions of eptacog beta use for BE treatment in patients on emicizumab or eptacog beta prophylaxis. This is a retrospective case series of 14 patients who received eptacog beta at seven haemophilia treatment centres, with HA (n = 11) or HB (n = 3) and inhibitors or anaphylaxis to factor replacement. Twenty-four spontaneous and traumatic BEs are described (muscle hematomas, joint hemarthroses, port site, and epistaxis) involving 11 subjects. Eptacog beta was effective for acute bleed treatment as both first-line therapy and for treatment of BEs refractory to eptacog alfa in 23/24 events. When eptacog beta was used for prophylaxis, 2/3 patients reported a decreased frequency of breakthrough BEs compared with prophylactic eptacog alfa and one patient experienced a similar frequency of breakthrough BEs compared with prophylactic activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Eptacog beta provided effective bleed control for three subjects who underwent minor surgical procedures. Treatment with eptacog beta was estimated to be 46%-72% more cost-effective than eptacog alfa. No safety concerns or adverse events were reported. In this case series, eptacog beta was safe, effective, and economical as first-line therapy, treatment of refractory BEs, management of perioperative bleeding, or prophylaxis in haemophilia patients with inhibitors."

This study aimed to analyze the molecular and clinical profiles of patients with severe HA and to determine if certain genetic variants predispose to inhibitor development in these patients. A single-center study was conducted among patients with severe HA between March 20, 2000, and June 31, 2023. Demographic data and laboratory results of patients were collected. The inverse-shifting PCR (IS-PCR) technique was initially used to screen patients for intron 22 and 1 inversions (Inv-22 and Inv-1). A total of 480 patients with severe HA (408 without inhibitors and 72 with inhibitors) were enrolled in this study. The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 6 months (IQR: 3 months to 18 months). Inv-22 was observed in 199 (41.5 %) of the cases. Among those patients who developed inhibitors, 53 (73.6 %) were classified as high-titer and 19 (26.4 %) as low-titer. Inv-22, positive family history of inhibitor formation, and history of intense injections revealed a statistically significant association with the risk of inhibitor development. The results of this study confirm the important role of different genetic variants, family history of inhibitor formation, and history of intense injections for the formation of inhibitors in patients with severe HA.

An improved PK analysis of individual outcomes may help to tailor hemophilia replacement treatment. <b>Methods:</b> PK outcomes after the infusion of a standard single dose of Efmoroctocog alfa were collected from 173 patients with severe/moderately severe hemophilia A in 11 Italian hemophilia centers. Factor VIII clotting activity (FVIII:C) was measured by one-stage clotting assay (OSA) in all patients, and chromogenic substrate assay (CSA) in a subgroup (<i>n</i> = 52). Fifty patients underwent a comparative PK assessment with standard half-life (SHL) recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA), one compartment model (OCM), and TCM were used to analyze the decay curves of all patients, and one-way paired ANOVA to compare the PK outcomes. <b>Results:</b> All 173 PKs conformed to the NCA and OCM, but only 106 (61%) conformed to the TCM based on the biphasic features of their decay curves. According to the TCM, the Beta HL and MRT of rFVIIIFc were 20.42 ± 7.73 and 25.64 ± 7.61 h, respectively. ANOVA analysis of the outcomes from the three PK models showed significant differences in clearance, half-life (HL), and mean residence time (MRT) (<i>p</i> < 0.001 for all parameters). As anticipated, the HL and MRT of rFVIIIFc were longer than those of SHL rFVIII. Comparing OSA with CSA outcomes, Cmax resulted higher when measured by CSA (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and, according to TCM, Beta HL resulted longer when measured by OSA (<i>p</i> = 0.03). FVIII:C trough levels obtained with SHL concentrates were significantly lower than those obtained with rFVIIIFc at each post-infusion time point. <b>Conclusions:</b> In a large group of hemophilia A (HA) patients, three different PK models confirmed the improved pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of rFVIIIFc, compared with standard half-life rFVIII concentrates. The TCM only fits two-thirds of the PKs, highlighting their biphasic decay and a long Beta half-life. In these patients, the TCM would be preferable to properly evaluate individual PK features."

    "abstract": "Factor VIII deficiency, also known as hemophilia A, is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Deficiency of Factor VIII results in dysfunction of platelet aggregation due to decreased activation of Factor X to Xa. We present the case of a 68-year-old male with mild hemophilia A (Factor VIII activity, 16%) who underwent a three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft and patent foramen ovale repair, with no increased bleeding utilizing a recombinant Factor VIII (kogenate) preoperative bolus and continuous infusion. His postoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound dehiscence requiring washout, sternal wire removal and omental flap coverage on postoperative Day 21. However, he required no postoperative blood transfusions."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by the development of antibodies against factor VIII. AHA has previously been reported in association with malignancy and autoimmune disorders, but rarely with liver disease. A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time is the initial laboratory manifestation of this condition but may be challenging to interpret in the setting of abnormal markers of coagulation typically seen in cirrhosis. We present a case of AHA in a patient with decompensated cirrhosis resulting in refractory bleeding and highlight the complexities of interpreting abnormal coagulation factors in patients with cirrhosis."

    "abstract": "The objective of this systematic study was to assess the perioperative management and outcome of surgery in pediatric patients with hemophilia A/B and inhibitors compared to nonhemophilic pediatric patients. The surgical outcome of 69 port catheter operations in patients with hemophilia who developed inhibitory antibodies against the administered factor was compared to 51 procedures in the control group. In the patients with hemophilia and inhibitors, a standardized protocol for recombinant activated factor VII was used to prevent perioperative bleeding. Hemophilic pediatric patients with inhibitors showed no significant differences in perioperative management (blood transfusion: <i>p</i> = 0.067, duration of surgery: <i>p</i> = 0.69; <i>p</i> = 0.824) in comparison to patients without hemophilia<i>.</i> The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in pediatric patients with hemophilia and inhibitors (20 days vs. 4 days for insertion; 12 days vs. 1 day for explantation). Moreover, no statistically significant difference was found for secondary bleeding (three patients with hemophilia vs. none in the control group; <i>p</i> = 0.11) or surgical complications (five hemophilia patients vs. none with grade I complication; one hemophilia patient vs. none with grade II complications; <i>p</i> = 0.067). This study has demonstrated that port catheter insertion and removal is safe in these patients. Moreover, it shows the importance of a coordinated approach with a multidisciplinary team."

Haematologists/haemato-oncologists and their patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Males aged ≥18 years with moderate or severe haemophilia A (baseline clotting factor level ≤5%), without existing inhibitors and currently receiving prophylaxis. Patients were grouped into those with or without haemophilia-affected joints (HAJs) based on bleeding, radiographic, surgical, mobility and joint pain data. Characterisation of humanistic and clinical outcomes in patients with or without HAJs. A total of 120 physicians provided data for 351 eligible patients; 209 (59.5%) patients had HAJs and 142 (40.5%) had no HAJs. Pain/discomfort was significantly different (p=0.01) and reported more frequently in the HAJ (85.7%) vs non-HAJ group (53.3%). Pain medication use was significantly higher in the HAJ versus non-HAJ group (73.2% vs 60.6%; p=0.01). Up to half of the patients with HAJs had synovitis (49.8%) or arthropathy (48.4%), and one-third had undergone joint surgery (35.4%). Overall health status was significantly worse in the HAJ versus non-HAJ group (mean (SD) EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale score: 65.5 (19.3) vs 81.1 (14.6); p=0.01). In this multinational real-world study, nearly two-thirds of adults with moderate/severe haemophilia A without inhibitors experienced HAJs despite prophylaxis. Individuals with HAJs had higher rates of pain and pain medication use, and lower HRQoL compared with those without HAJs. These data indicate that HAJs represent a clinically relevant burden and early identification/monitoring and management of affected joints should be an important consideration to help prevent long-term joint morbidity."

However, its clinical applicability still requires extensive validation. To evaluate the clinical applicability of targeted LRS-based analysis compared with routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Gene variants of retrieved subjects were retrospectively and prospectively analyzed. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to further analyze undiagnosed cases. Breakpoints of novel genomic rearrangements were mapped and validated using long-distance PCR and long-range PCR combined with sequencing. In total, 122 subjects were retrieved. In retrospective analysis of the 90 HA cases, HA-LRS assay showed consistent results in 84 cases compared with routine methods and characterized 6 large deletions with their exact breakpoints confirmed by further validation in 6 cases (routine methods only presented failure in amplifying the involved exons). In prospective analysis of the 21 HA subjects, 20 variants of F8 were identified in 20 cases. For the remaining HA patient, no duplication/deletion or single-nucleotide variant (SNV)/insertion and deletion (InDel) was found, but a potential recombination involving exons 14 and 21 of F8 was observed by LRS. Whole-genome sequencing analysis and further verification defined a 30 478 base pairs (bp) tandem repeat involving exons 14 to 21 of F8. Among the 11 HB patients, HB-LRS analysis detected 11 SNVs/InDels in F9, consistent with routine methods. Targeted LRS-based analysis was efficient and comprehensive in identifying SNVs/InDels and genomic rearrangements of hemophilia genes, especially when we first expanded the panel to include F9. However, further investigation for complex gross rearrangement is still essential."

We hypothesized that the direct expressed FXa has the potential to activate the common pathway and restore coagulation in hemophilia patients. In this study, the cassettes that expressed FXa, FXaop and FXa-FVII were packaged into an engineered AAV capsid, AAV843, and were delivered into hemophilia A and B mice by intravenous injection. AAV-FXaop could be stably expressed in vivo and showed the best immediate and prolonged hemostatic effects, similar to those of commercial drugs (Xyntha and Benefix). AAV-FXaop also significantly inhibited bleeding in hemophilia A mice with inhibitors. In addition, FXa expression in joints significantly alleviated the occurrence of hemophilic synovitis. AAV-delivered FXa may be a novel target for treating hemophilic and hemophilic synovitis."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is managed with coagulation clotting factor VIII (FVIII) therapy that poses significant challenges, such as a high treatment burden, immunogenicity, inconsistent hemostatic cover, poor treatment outcomes, and musculoskeletal progression despite adequate prophylactic treatment. Various non-factor therapies, such as several natural anticoagulant inhibitors and factor FVIII mimetics, have been developed to address these unmet needs. However, the role of emicizumab in addressing these unmet needs remains underexplored. This review delves into the evolution of hemophilia A replacement clotting therapy from plasma-derived products to recombinant products and, more recently, nonfactor therapies. It underscores the unmet needs of replacement therapy and explores the nonfactor therapies developed to address them. The review then comprehensively summarizes the clinical trial and real-world experience data, demonstrating how emicizumab tackles these unsatisfied demands. Replacement clotting factor therapies as the standard of care has exposed several needs that have yet to be addressed. However, data from numerous emicizumab clinical trials and real-world experience offer a promising outlook, suggesting that it may effectively address many unmet needs. As hemophilia treatment goals continue to evolve, the role of currently developed nonfactor therapies in hemophilia management is yet to be fully defined."

This was a retrospective study involving patients switching to rVIII-SingleChain from other FVIIIs in 7 Spanish and Portuguese hospitals. The efficacy and safety of replacement therapies were compared between 12 months before switching and the period from switching to the end of the study. Twenty-nine patients (median age 25 years; severe hemophilia A, 37.9%) were recruited. Before switching, 12 were on prophylaxis and were followed-up for a median of 12 months. After switching, 17 received prophylaxis with rVIII-SingleChain and were followed-up for a median of 41 months. Those with ≤2 weekly infusions increased from 37.5% before switching to 60.7% after switching to rVIII-SingleChain. The median monthly consumption was 312 IU/kg with prior FVIIIs and 273 IU/kg with rVII-SingleChain. Six spontaneous bleeds were reported in each period in the prophylaxis patients. In the entire cohort, 50 bleeds were reported with prior FVIIIs and 33 were reported after switching to rVIII-SingleChain. Patients requiring ≤1 dose for hemostasis increased from 44.0% with prior FVIIIs to 60.6% with rVIII-SingleChain. Responses were rated good/excellent in 95.4% of cases. No safety concerns were reported. Patients who switched to rVIII-SingleChain prophylaxis had excellent bleeding control and reduced infusion frequency in regular clinical practice, with the subsequent increase in quality-of-life."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The typical phenotype of hemophilia A (HA) is that of frequent bleeding episodes, up to several per month, unless prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII) replacement or alternatives are given. Related bleeding may be heightened in severity or frequency by co-morbid bleeding disorders. Based on the reported prevalence of von Willebrand disease (VWD) of up to 1% of the general population, the co-existence of HA and VWD occurs, but is likely less recognized. Prophylactic FVIII replacement may or may not adequately prevent bleeding in persons with HA and mild VWD, and plasma-derived concentrates containing FVIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) may be used for more successful bleeding prophylaxis. However, therapy adherence remains problematic for many reasons, one being treatment via intravenous access. Emicizumab is a nonfactor subcutaneous prophylactic therapy for HA that may overcome this concern. We describe three patients, with severe HA and VWD, for whom regular FVIII/VWF prophylaxis was deemed inadequate. FVIII/VWF prophylaxis was replaced with weekly prophylactic injections of the bispecific monoclonal antibody, emicizumab. When the patients were transitioned to emicizumab, all experienced a significant reduction in their annualized bleed rate (ABR). Although the mechanism of action does not directly affect or replace VWF function, emicizumab may be an effective prophylaxis alternative to FVIII/VWF concentrate in patients with concomitant severe HA and VWD."

    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia A can develop joint hemarthroses, degenerative changes, and eventually undergo total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Few data exist concerning complications and prosthesis survival after TSA in this population. (1) Is hemophilia A associated with more bleeding and thromboembolic adverse events after TSA relative to matched controls? (2) Is 5-year TSA prosthesis survival reduced in patients with hemophilia A compared with matched controls? The 2010 to 2022 PearlDiver M161 database was used to identify patients who underwent primary anatomic or reverse TSA. Given that the X-linked recessive condition hemophilia A presents nearly exclusively in males, male patients with hemophilia A who underwent TSA were matched 1:10 with male patients without hemophilia who underwent TSA based on age and Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI). This yielded 73 patients with hemophilia A who underwent TSA who were matched 1:10 with 729 patients without hemophilia. Ninety-day adverse events were compared with multivariable analysis. Revision within 5 years was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Compared with the control cohort, patients with hemophilia had greater odds of bleeding issues (hematoma, OR 6.8 [95% CI 3.0 to 15.3]; p < 0.001; anemia, OR 2.5 [95% CI 1.5 to 4.2]; p < 0.001, transfusion, OR 5.0 [95% CI 2.4 to 10.3]; p < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (OR 1.9 [95% CI 1.1 to 3.1]; p = 0.01), and prosthetic loosening (OR 3.5 [95% CI 1.4 to 8.0]; p = 0.004). Based on available data, 5-year implant survival was not different in patients with hemophilia (97.3% [95% CI 93.6% to 100.0%]) relative to matched controls (95.2% [95% CI 93.4% to 97.2%]; p = 0.60). The elevated risks of both 90-day bleeding complications (hematoma, anemia, and transfusion) and VTE (DVT and PE) in patients with hemophilia emphasize the special challenges of carefully balancing factor replacement and VTE prophylaxis pre-, intra-, and postoperatively on an individual patient basis with careful hematologist coordination. Further study on Factor VIII levels and targets as well as tranexamic acid and VTE prophylaxis in this population is necessary to provide further guidance. Furthermore, 5-year implant survival was not different between patients with hemophilia and matched controls (patients without hemophilia) based on available data, suggesting that TSA survivorship remains durable and may be offered to patients in this population as indicated.

    "abstract": "The improved quality of care and increased drug availability have shifted the goal of treating people with hemophilia from life-threatening bleeding prevention to joint health preservation and quality of life amelioration. Many tools are now available to the clinician in order to optimize the management of hemophilic arthropathy. This paper reviews the pivotal role of ultrasound evaluation in early detection of joint bleeding and differential diagnosis of joint pain, with a focus on the feasibility of a long-term monitoring of joint health through the use of artificial intelligence and telemedicine. The literature search methodology included using keywords to search in PubMed and Google Scholar, and articles used were screened by the coauthors of this review. Joint ultrasound is a practical point-of-care tool with many advantages, including immediate correlation between imaging and clinical presentation, and dynamic evaluation of multiple joints. The potential of telemedicine care, coupled with a point-of-care detection device assisted by artificial intelligence, holds promises for even earlier diagnosis and treatment of joint bleeding. A multidisciplinary approach including early intervention by physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) physicians and physiotherapists is crucial to ensure the best possible quality of life for the patient."

Twenty-eight patients with hemophilia were recruited. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (four weeks of immersive movement visualization) and a control group (no intervention). The intensity of pain, pressure pain threshold in the knee, tibialis anterior muscle, lower back level, conditioned pain modulation, range of knee motion, and lower limb functionality were evaluated. There were statistically significant differences in the intergroup effect on knee pain intensity (<i>F</i> = 23.71; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and lower limb functionality (<i>F</i> = 7.11; <i>p</i> = 0.003). 42.86% of the patients in the experimental group exhibited changes greater than the minimum detectable change (MDC) in functionality. 39.29% of the patients subject to the intervention experienced changes greater than the MDC in the knee pressure pain threshold. Immersive motion visualization can improve the intensity of joint pain and functionality in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy. Functionality, pressure pain threshold, and pain intensity improved in those patients who conducted immersive movement visualization.Implications for rehabilitationImmersive visualization of movement significantly improves intensity of joint pain, functionality, pressure pain threshold, joint health, and conditioned pain modulation in patients with hemophilic knee arthropathy.The fact that it is a therapy without potential aversive stimuli makes it a possible access pathway for patients with high levels of kinesiophobia and/or catastrophism.This low-cost, home-based technology allows its use in patients far from hemophilia reference centers or with difficult access to physiotherapy treatments.The immersive visualization of movement influences the democratization of treatment, in accordance with the WHO's Sustainable Development Goal 3 (health and well-being for all)."

They offer opportunities to address the underlying genetic defect by gene addition, i.e., the delivery of the gene of interest to the target cells, or by genome editing approaches through direct repair of disease-causing mutations. This paper outlines clinical evidence requirements in the context of marketing authorisations for rare diseases. Two out of fifteen gene therapies that have been approved in the European Union since 2018 are used as case studies: Libmeldy (atidarsagen autotemcel) for the treatment of patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Roctavian (valoctocogen roxaparvovec) for the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. Special aspects of the evaluation of single-arm trials with small sample size and requirements with regard to the isolation and causal attribution of the treatment effect are discussed. The role of clinical data obtained under everyday conditions (real world data) to support the generation of evidence in the pre- and post authorisation phase is critically examined. Furthermore, the paper outlines aspects related to conditional versus standard marketing authorisations as well as aspects related to registry-based non-interventional studies in the context of market and patient access to urgently needed drugs."

To describe the methods used to develop a content validated patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that measures MHO for people with haemophilia. A conceptual framework, developed from a literature/evidence review, was used to create an interview guide and draft a questionnaire. Males aged 15 or older with severe/moderate haemophilia were eligible to participate in concept elicitation or cognitive debriefing interviews. The conceptual framework was refined based on a thematic analysis of concept elicitation interviews and PROM items were developed from the conceptual framework. Cognitive debriefing sessions that prioritised relevance and understanding of the PROM were held in two rounds; items were updated iteratively. A conceptual framework with five domains (stigma, anxiety, depression, life interference and identity) was constructed from over 300 identified MHO concepts. Fifty-three participants took part in interviews. After 32 concept elicitation interviews, the framework was updated by including eight new sub-concepts and eliminating two. Updates to the questionnaire included items added or removed and improved wording. The final coreHEM MHO PROM has 26 questions in two sections (general mental health associated with haemophilia, and a gene therapy section). The instrument is content-validated and can be used as an exploratory outcome. MHO scores can be measured and compared to give more insight into patient quality of life."

    "abstract": "Almost half of severe hemophilia A (HA) cases are caused by an intron 22 inversion (Int22Inv) mutation, which truncates the 26-exon F8 messenger RNA (mRNA) after exon 22. Another F8 transcript, F8<sub>B</sub>, is initiated from within F8-intron-22. F8<sub>B</sub> mRNA consists of a short exon spliced to exons 23 to 26 and is expressed in multiple human cell types. It has been hypothesized that Int22Inv patients have self-tolerance to partial factor (F)VIII proteins expressed from these 2 transcripts. FVIII is expressed in endothelial cells, primarily in the liver and lungs. Several studies have reported FVIII expression in other cell types, although this has been controversial. To determine if partial FVIII proteins are expressed from intron 22-inverted and/or F8<sub>B</sub> mRNA and if FVIII is expressed in nonendothelial cells. A panel of FVIII-specific antibodies was validated and employed to label FVIII in cells and tissues and for immunoprecipitation followed by western blots and mass spectrometry proteomics analysis. Immunofluorescent staining localized FVIII to endothelial cells in liver sections from non-HA but not HA-Int22Inv dogs. Neither FVIII nor FVIII<sub>B</sub> was detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, B cell or T cell lines, or cell lines expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas FVIII antigen and activity were readily detected in primary nonhemophilic liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. If FVIII is expressed in nonendothelial cells or if partial FVIII proteins are expressed in HA-Int22Inv, the concentrations are below the detection limits of these sensitive assays. Our results argue against promotion of immune tolerance through expression of partial FVIII proteins in Int-22Inv patients."

However, health information is often fragmented across hospital information systems, digital health apps, and questionnaire portals. This also pertains to hemophilia care, in which scattered information hampers integrated care. We intend to co-design a nationwide digital personal health record (PHR) for patients to help manage their health information. For this, user perspectives are crucial. This study aims to assess patients' and health care providers' perspectives regarding the use of a PHR in hemophilia care in the Netherlands, required functionalities, and expectations and concerns. In this semistructured interview study, 19 pediatric and adult persons with hemophilia, parents, and women with other inherited bleeding disorders, as well as 18 health care providers working within and outside of hemophilia treatment centers, participated. Perspectives of patients and providers were explored separately. To explore requirements, participants were asked to prioritize functionalities. Participants expected a PHR would increase the transparency of health information, improve patients' understanding of their illness, and help the coordination of care between health care providers and institutions. Prioritized functionalities included the integration of relevant health information and patient-entered data. Formulated expectations and concerns focused on 4 themes: usability, safety, inclusiveness, and implementation. While patients expressed worries over medicalization (ie, more confrontational reminders of their illness), providers were concerned about an increased workload. People with hemophilia, their parents, and health care providers welcomed the development of a PHR, as they expected it would result in better coordinated care. Formulated expectations and concerns will contribute to the successful development of a PHR for persons with hemophilia, and ultimately, for all persons with a chronic condition."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) is an attractive treatment for hemophilia A. Careful clinical management is required to minimize the risk of hepatotoxicity, including assessment of baseline liver condition to determine treatment eligibility and monitoring liver function after gene therapy. This article describes recommendations (developed by a group of hemophilia experts) on hepatic function monitoring before and after gene therapy. To prevent harmful liver-related effects, gene therapy is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled liver infections, autoimmune hepatitis, liver stiffness ≥8 kPa, or cirrhosis. Before using gene therapy in patients with liver steatosis or other liver disorders, the risk of liver damage should be considered using a highly individualized approach. Treatment is not recommended in patients with abnormal liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at any level above the upper limit of normal (ULN). Therefore, pretreatment assessment of liver health should include laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasound, and liver stiffness measurements by transient elastography (TE). In the first year after therapy, ALT levels should be monitored 1 to 2 times per week to detect elevations ≥1.5× ULN, which may require immunosuppressant therapy. Patients with ALT elevation should receive prednisone 60 mg/d for 2 weeks, followed by stepwise tapering when ALT returns to baseline. ALT monitoring should continue long term (every 3-6 months), along with abdominal ultrasound (every 6 months) and TE (yearly) evaluations. When patients with good liver health are selected for treatment and closely monitored thereafter, ALT elevations can be promptly treated and are expected to resolve without long-term hepatic sequelae."

    "abstract": "The prolongation in APTT reflects various disorders affecting the blood coagulation system. Automated coagulation analyzers such as ACL TOP, help in evaluating the clotting cascade by displaying clot reaction curves or waveforms. The fibrin formation curve forms S-shaped curve showing the changes in the absorbance on X-axis and time in seconds on Y-axis. The clotting data is processed to obtain derivatives. This observational study analyzed 80 samples including 20 samples from normal healthy individuals as control. The parameters studied were time (secs), height (mAbs), and width (secs) of first derivative (FD), fibrin clot time at ½ height, height (mAbs), and width (secs) of both first and second peaks of second derivative (SD). Hemophilia (n = 13) that consisted of factor VIII deficiency (n = 11) and factor IX deficiency (n = 2) showed biphasic patterns in both first DC and second DC. Cases with thrombosis (n = 8) showed marked elevation in first DC. Various other disorders (n = 39) that consisted of mainly hepatic dysfunction (n = 24) showed prolongation in fibrin formation, first DC, and second DC peak time. The atypical derivative curve analysis helps in determining the interferences in clotting cascade. It gives significant information and provides direction for further testing."

    "title": "Association of bullous pemphigoid with acquired hemophilia A: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A, a rare condition resulting in spontaneous bleeding without prior bleeding disorders, arises due to autoantibody-mediated inhibition of coagulation factor VIII and is typically associated with autoimmune, neoplastic, drug, or obstetric factors. We present the case of a 31-year-old woman with bullous pemphigoid, managed with corticosteroids since 2013, who presented spontaneous hemorrhagic manifestations. Upon admission, laboratory tests revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, and a factor VIII level < 1%, indicative of acquired hemophilia A. Further assessments showed elevated Ristocetin cofactor activity, von Willebrand factor antigen, and a factor VIII inhibitor level of 665 BU. This underscores the importance of considering acquired hemophilia A in autoimmune dermatological conditions like bullous pemphigoid, highlighting the association between autoimmune disorders and coagulation abnormalities, particularly in cases of spontaneous hemorrhagic events."

    "title": "Increased Expression Level of Human Blood Clotting Factor VIII Using NS0 Cell Line as a Host Cells.",
    "abstract": "Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is applied for spontaneous hemorrhaging inhibition and excessive bleeding after trauma in patients with hemophilia A. High-quality human recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) has been produced relatively in large quantities in cultured mammalian cells. NS0 is one of the most common mammalian cell lines for therapeutic protein production. Production of rFVIII has increased due to low FVIII expression levels and rising demand for hemophilia A prophylactic treatment. Several methods have been developed to prevent cell cycle progression in mammalian cells for increased recombinant protein yields. The aim of the study was to investigate the level of recombinant BDD-FVIII expression in NS0 mouse myeloma cells. Additionally, the study aimed to determine the effects of chemical drugs, Mitomycin C, Lovastatin, and Metformin on the secretion of FVIII through cell cycle arrest. We cultured NS0 cells and transfected them with the 2 μg pcDNA3-hBDDFVIII plasmid by Lipofectamine 3000. The cells were treated with 10 μg.mL<sup>-1</sup> Mitomycin C, 20 μM Lovastatin, and 20 mM Metformin separately. After 24 and 48 hours, the samples were collected and, protein expression was analyzed using RT-PCR, Dot blot, and ELISA. A higher protein expression level was observed in treated cells 24h and 48h after treatment with all three drugs. According to real-time PCR, Metformin treatment resulted in the highest expression level within 24 h (P=0.0026), followed by Mitomycin C treatment within 48 h (P=0.0030). The NS0 cell line can be regarded as a suitable host for FVIII production. FVIII protein expression level was increased by using Lovastatin, Metformin, and Mitomycin C drugs. Further investigations are suggested, and the potential application of these drugs to increase recombinant protein yield can be used to produce therapeutic proteins in the industry."

Using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is known to be the most accurate method, this investigation aims to postulate reference data for body composition parameters within haemophilia severity phenotypes and age groups. Persons underwent whole body DXA screening using Horizon. Body fat percentage, estimated visceral adipose tissue (VAT), appendicular fat and lean mass, and lean and fat mass in relation to body height were assessed. Haemophilia severity and five age groups were distinguished. Two hundred and one persons with mild (n = 44), moderate (n = 41), or severe (n = 116) haemophilia A/B (median age 40 [28-55; 1.IQ-3.IQ] years) were analysed. The median body fat percentage was 28.7% [25.5%-33.9%] and median estimated VAT was 657 g [403-954 g] with no significant difference between severity phenotypes (p = .474; p = .781). Persons with severe haemophilia had less lean mass compared to moderate and mild haemophilia (p = .013; p = .034). Total and appendicular fat is increased in older PwH (aged ≥40 years) compared to younger PwH (aged ≤29 years; p < .05). Lean mass did not differ between age groups. This study provides valuable reference data for body composition parameters in PwH. Persons with severe haemophilia show significantly less lean mass compared to persons with moderate or mild haemophilia. Body fat percentage and VAT did not differ between severity phenotypes, but increased with age."

    "abstract": "Testing for coagulation factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX) plays significant importance in the diagnostic and treatment of hemophilia A and B. External quality assessment (EQA) scheme aimed to assess the participants' performance of testing for coagulation factors and identify shortcomings in clinical practice. This study aimed to investigate the performance trends of the participating laboratories in China national external quality assessment Scheme (China NEQAS) for FVIII and FIX over a five-year period (2019-2023). A total of ten external quality assessment (EQA) rounds were conducted from 2019 to 2023 in the China NEQAS for FVIII and FIX. The distribution of method, reagent and instrument were calculated. The trends of method- specific inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) and pass rates were analyzed over 5 years. The dilutions for coagulation factor testing were also investigated. All laboratories use one-stage assays to detect FVIII and FIX activity. The inter-laboratory overall CV decreased year by year (10.9 % to 9.3 % for FVIII and 13.5 % to 10.2 % for FIX), and the laboratory pass rate steadily increased (88.0 % to 93.4 % for FVIII and 81.3 % to 92.7 % for FIX). The majority of laboratories employed a single dilution methodology for the assessment of FVIII and FIX activity. The interlaboratory CV was elevated for the Siemens reagent (Actin FSL) during analysis of moderately abnormal FIX concentrations of EQA samples in most batches. The implementation of the external quality assessment has contributed to facilitate the enhancement of testing quality. Chromogenic assay is a supplement to accurate determination when necessary. Laboratories may choose to perform dilution tests or direct assays to identify the presence of inhibitors, particularly when they are suspected."

    "abstract": "Prophylactic replacement therapy for hemophilia A (hereditary factor VIII deficiency) is a success story of the production of coagulation factor concentrates from donor plasma. Recombinant factor concentrates, which are also produced with modified gene constructs for coagulation factor VIII in order to improve pharmacological properties, have since proven their worth. This successful development over many years of factor concentrates for the successful treatment of hemophilia patients has now been followed by the innovation of a factor VIII mimetic in the form of a monoclonal antibody, which was developed in Japan already some years back. Emicizumab is a humanized, bispecific monoclonal antibody for therapeutic use in hemophilia A. With this therapeutic agent, the treatment of the hereditary coagulation defect is based, for the first time, on a completely new active principle. The specific antibody simulates the properties of coagulation factor VIII as a cofactor for the formation of the tenase complex with the coagulation factors IX and X. As a result under steady state conditions almost normal thrombin and thus fibrin formation can be achieved."

    "abstract": "The bleeding disorder hemophilia A (HemA) requires systemic functional factor VIII protein infusions on prophylactic schedules. Recently, chemically modified mRNAs have emerged as promising protein replacement therapies to reduce repeated infusions and improve safety profiles. However, the influence of base modifications on mRNA translation kinetics to specific cell types remains unexplored. In this study, towards developing mRNA therapeutics for haemophilia A, we synthesized chemically modified mRNAs with commercially available base modifications of adenine, guanine, uridine, and cytidine, and evaluated <i>in vitro</i> transcription yield and translation kinetics in hepatic cell lines using reporter eGFP mRNA. Our findings demonstrated that mRNA with <i>N</i><sup>1</sup>-methyl pseudouridine (m<sup>1</sup>Ψ) showed a 5-12-fold increase in translation efficiency in both hepatic and endothelial cell lines. As a proof of concept for developing mRNA therapy for HemA, where FVIII is deficient, we developed a m<sup>1</sup>Ψ modified functional FVIII mRNA with our liver-targeting lipid nanoparticle (Gal-LNP) system. We evaluated its delivery efficiencies in both hepatic cell lines and the HemA mouse model. The m<sup>1</sup>Ψ-FVIII mRNA showed high therapeutic efficacy up to 15 days <i>in vivo</i> in the HemA mouse model. Gal-LNPs were found to be safe for systemic administration. Our study reveals that incorporating m<sup>1</sup>Ψ base modifications on mRNAs could improve therapeutic efficacy in liver- and endothelial-based therapeutics. Optimized mRNA synthesis for superior expression kinetics in hepatic cells and its delivery with liver-targeted nanoparticles may emerge as protein replacement therapies for monogenic liver disorders."

    "abstract": "Since June 2021 in France, patients with haemophilia A with anti-factor VIII inhibitors and patients with severe haemophilia A without anti-factor VIII inhibitors have the choice between the community and the hospital pharmacy for dispensing emicizumab (Hemlibra®). This study aims to investigate patient-centred access to treatment by evaluating and comparing the dimensions of the Penchansky and Thomas model, between community and hospital pharmacies. The evaluation of access to treatment was based on the dimensions of the Penchansky and Thomas model: accessibility, availability, acceptability, accommodation and affordability. These were assessed using appropriate and specific indicators in the study context and calculated for patients choosing community pharmacy or hospital pharmacy for emicizumab dispensing. Geographical data collected as part of the national 'PASO DOBLE DEMI' study were used for this analysis. The findings reveal that dispensing emicizumab in community pharmacies improves accessibility by significantly reducing travel time. The availability of healthcare services is also improved due to the territorial coverage of community pharmacies. The extended opening hours and low waiting time also contribute to better access to emicizumab in community pharmacies. The dimension of acceptability must be improved, and further investigations are needed to address the affordability dimension. Several months after emicizumab became available in French community pharmacies, access to treatment has significantly improved, reducing the burden of this rare chronic disease for patients and their careers. These results suggest that this innovative model could be extended to other medicines and even other therapeutic areas."

    "abstract": "Congenital combined deficiency of factor V (FV) and factor VIII (FVIII; F5F8D, OMIM 227300) is a rare hereditary coagulopathy and accounts for approximately 3% of cases of rare coagulation disorders. The prevalence of this disease in the general population is estimated to be 1:1,000,000 and is significantly higher in regions where consanguineous marriages are permitted, such as the Mideast and South Asia. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and therefore occurs with an equal incidence among males and females. Heterozygous mutation carriers usually do not have clinical manifestations. The molecular basis of this disease differs from that of stand-alone congenital deficiencies of FVIII and FV. F5F8D is caused by mutations in either <i>LMAN1</i> or <i>MCFD2</i>, which encode components of a cargo receptor complex for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport of FV and FVIII, leading to defects in an intracellular transport pathway shared by these two coagulation factors. Congenital combined deficiency of FV and FVIII is characterized by decreased activities of both FV and FVIII in plasma, usually to 5 to 30% of normal. Clinical manifestations in most cases are represented by mild or moderate hemorrhagic syndrome. The simultaneous decreases of two coagulation factors present complications in the diagnosis and management of the disease. In female patients, the disease requires a special approach for family planning, pregnancy management, and parturition. This review summarizes recent progress in clinical, laboratory, and molecular understanding of this disorder."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is an X-linked disorder characterized by quantitative deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) caused by pathogenic variants in the factor 8 (<i>F8</i>) gene. Our study's primary objective was to identify genetic variants within the exonic region of <i>F8</i> in 50 Colombian male participants with severe hemophilia A (HA). Whole-exome sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed, and bivariate analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between identified variants, disease severity, and inhibitor risk formation. Out of the 50 participants, 21 were found to have 17 different pathogenic <i>F8</i> variants (var). It was found that 70% (var = 12) of them were premature truncation variants (nonsense, frameshift), 17.6% (var = 3) were missense mutations, and 11.7% (var = 2) were splice-site variants. Interestingly, 35% (var = 6) of the identified variants have not been previously reported in the literature. All patients with a history of positive inhibitors (n = 4) were found to have high-impact genetic variants (nonsense and frameshift). When investigating the relationship between variant location (heavy versus light chain) and specific inhibitor risk, 75% (n = 3) of the inhibitor participants were found to have variants located in the <i>F8</i> light chain (<i>p</i> = 0.075), suggesting that conserved domains are associated with higher inhibitor risk. In summary, we identified genetic variants within the <i>F8</i> that can possibly influence inhibitor development in Colombian patients with severe HA. Our results provide a basis for future studies and the development of further personalized treatment strategies in this population."

This cross-sectional study used a discrete choice experiment approach to assess treatment preferences among patients with hemophilia A and their caregivers. Respondents chose between 2 hypothetical treatments defined by 7 attributes including no bleeding episode, treated events of joint bleeding, long-term safety, type of treatment and risk of thromboembolic events, administration frequency, consumption route, and monitoring dosing options. Preference weights and relative importance (RI) of attributes were estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model. A total of 51 eligible respondents completed the discrete choice experiment (patients, 76.5%; caregivers, 23.5%). Most patients (70.6%) had severe hemophilia and 43.1% received prophylactic treatment for >10 years. Respondents valued \"type of treatment and risk of thromboembolic events\" as the most important factor (RI 26.2%; 95% CI 20.9-31.5) followed by \"consumption route\" (RI 25.8%; 95% CI 20.7-30.9) and \"administration frequency\" (RI 15.2%; 95% CI 12.0-18.4). \"Monitoring dosing options\" was the least important attribute (RI 6.3%; 95% CI 5.2-7.4). Respondents had 63% possibility to choose a treatment profile that has factor VIII product compared with nonfactor product. Patients and caregivers valued \"type of treatment and risk of thromboembolic events\" as the most important driver in choosing a treatment for moderate or severe hemophilia A.

PK variations were assessed according to age, blood type, inhibitor history, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) level, and body mass index. Additionally, the correlation between the PK profile and prophylaxis regimen was specifically analyzed for each product in severe cases. The PK data of 48 and 81 patients treated with octocog alfa and rurioctocog alfa pegol, respectively, were obtained. The median half-lives of octocog alfa and rurioctocog alfa pegol were 9.9 (range: 6.3-15.2) h and 15.3 (range: 10.4-23.9) h, respectively. The PK profiles for each product did not differ according to age group; however, blood type-O patients had shorter half-lives and time to 1% compared to non-blood type-O patients. In regression analysis, the PK of octocog alfa showed a statistically significant difference according to age, whereas the PK of rurioctocog alfa pegol correlated with vWF:Ag. Only the frequency of rurioctocog alfa pegol use showed a statistically significant difference in relation to time to 1%, although the coefficient of determination was small. This study confirmed significant interpatient variation in the PK of FVIII among Korean patients with hemophilia A. To achieve optimized prophylaxis, personalizing the regimen based on the PK profile of each individual patient is essential."

To explore associations between unemployment due to disability and treatment while adjusting for known risk factors for unemployment. Collecting data from 20 hemophilia centers from 15 European countries, the Age-related DeVelopments ANd ComorbiditiEs in hemophilia study recruited 785 participants aged 40 years and over with hemophilia A or B. A comprehensive electronic case report form included items related to patient characteristics, demographic information, past and current treatment regimens, and medical history, including a lifelong history of comorbidities. Baseline data from the Age-related DeVelopments ANd ComorbiditiEs in hemophilia study was analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. Employment status was available for 756 of 785 participants aged 40 to 88 years (median, 53 years). We used regression analysis to compare people with hemophilia who were fully employed with those who were unemployed due to disability. This analysis included 424 participants. Using multivariable logistic regression, we found that age (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; <i>P</i> < .01), severe hemophilia (OR, 10.81; <i>P</i> < .01), current smoker (OR, 2.53; <i>P</i> < .01), and psychiatric disorder (OR, 4.18; <i>P</i> = .02) were associated with increased odds of unemployment due to disability.

Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is a therapeutic approach to eradicate alloantibodies (inhibitors) against exogenous FVIII in people with inherited hemophilia A. Few studies have evaluated the role of F8 variants on ITI outcome. We included people with severe hemophilia A (FVIII ˂ 1 international units/dL) and high-responding inhibitors (≥ 5 Bethesda units/mL lifelong) who underwent a first course of ITI. Socio-demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. ITI outcomes were defined as total, partial successes, and failure. Detection of intron 1 and 22 inversions was performed by polymerase-chain reaction, followed by F8 sequencing. We included 168 people with inherited hemophilia A and high-responding inhibitors, median age 6 years at ITI start. Intron 22 inversion was the most prevalent variant (53.6 %), followed by nonsense (16.1 %), small insertion/deletion (11.3 %), and large deletion (10.7 %). In comparison with intron 22 inversion, the odds of ITI failure were 15.5 times higher (odds ratio [OR] 15.50; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 4.59-71.30) and 4.25 times higher (95 % CI, 1.53-12.3) among carriers of F8 large deletions and small insertions and deletions, respectively. F8 large deletions and small insertions/deletions predicted ITI failure after a first course of ITI in patients with severe hemophilia A and high-responding inhibitors. This is the first study to show F8 large deletions and small insertions/deletions as predictors of ITI failure."

    "title": "What is a cure through gene therapy? An analysis and evaluation of the use of \"cure\".",
    "abstract": "The development of gene therapy has always come with the expectation that it will offer a cure for various disorders, of which hemophilia is a paradigm example. However, although the term is used regularly, it is unclear what exactly is meant with \"cure\". Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse how the concept of cure is used in practice and evaluate which of the interpretations is most suitable in discussions surrounding gene therapy. We analysed how cure is used in four different medical fields where the concept raises discussion. We show that cure can be used in three different ways: cure as normalization of the body, cure as obtaining a normal life, or cure as a change in identity. We argue that since cure is a practical term, its interpretation should be context-specific and the various uses can exist simultaneously, as long as their use is suitable to the function the notion of cure plays in each of the settings. We end by highlighting three different settings in the domain of hemophilia gene therapy in which the term cure is used and explore the function(s) it serves in each setting. We conclude that in the clinical application of gene therapy, it could be better to abandon the term cure, whereas more modest and specified definitions of cure are required in the context of health resource allocation decisions and decisions on research funding."

    "title": "Navigating the Challenges of Factor X Deficiency: A Case Study.",
    "abstract": "The clotting pathway involves intrinsic and extrinsic pathways converging into a common pathway. These pathways require activated factors that sequentially convert prothrombin to thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a stable clot. Clotting factor deficiency impairs this cascade leading to excessive bleeding or bruising due to insufficient clot formation. Here, we present the case of a 47-year-old female who initially complained of epigastric pain. By the third day of admission, she experienced four to five episodes of bleeding gums, resulting in a blood loss of approximately 300 mL. The patient exhibited abnormal prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) values, leading to a diagnosis of Factor X (FX) deficiency upon further evaluation. This case report emphasizes the need to diagnose coagulopathies such as FX deficiency and how early diagnosis will help not only in patient care and management but also in screening family members who may be affected."

    "title": "Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of Emicizumab Prophylaxis in Egyptian Pediatric Patients with Hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is a hereditary X-linked bleeding disorder secondary to deficiency of the clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody that replaces the function of the activated FVIII and prevents bleeding in HA patients. Emicizumab is expected to ameliorate bleeding risk in those patients together with subsequent complications. However, there is a scarcity of data about its safety and efficacy in patients with HA. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of emicizumab prophylaxis in Egyptian pediatric patients with HA. A prospective cohort study was carried out with 88 HA patients who received emicizumab prophylaxis. Breakthrough bleeding episodes and the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) were reported for all patients before and after emicizumab prophylaxis. Also, all adverse events during prophylaxis were documented to evaluate the safety of emicizumab. Joint bleeds occurred in 94% of the patients. Among those patients, 58% had one target joint, 36.4% had more than one target joint, and 5.6% had no target joints. Furthermore, 17% of patients were positive for FVIII inhibitors. The median annualized joint bleeding rate was reduced remarkably after emicizumab prophylaxis (36 before versus 0 after emicizumab). The median ABR was 48 before emicizumab versus 0 after emicizumab. Eight patients experienced mild breakthrough bleeding episodes. The most common adverse events were local reactions at injection sites, headache, arthralgia, fever, and diarrhea. Prophylaxis using emicizumab was associated with a significantly lower bleeding rate in HA patients with and without inhibitors. The majority of patients had zero bleeds with emicizumab prophylaxis."

    "abstract": "Durable factor VIII expression that normalizes hemostasis is an unrealized goal of hemophilia A adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy. Trials with initially normal factor VIII activity observed unexplained year-over-year declines in expression while others reported low-level, stable expression inadequate to restore normal hemostasis. Here we demonstrate that male mice recapitulate expression-level-dependent loss of factor VIII levels due to declines in vector copy number. We show that an enhanced function factor VIII variant (factor VIII-R336Q/R562Q), resistant to activated protein C-mediated inactivation, normalizes hemostasis at below-normal expression without evidence of prothrombotic risk in male hemophilia A mice. These data support that factor VIII-R336Q/R562Q may restore normal factor VIII function at low levels of expression to permit durability using low vector doses to minimize dose-dependent adeno-associated virus toxicities. This work informs the mechanism of factor VIII durability after gene transfer and supports that factor VIII-R336Q/R562Q may safely overcome current hemophilia A gene therapy limitations."

    "abstract": "Despite numerous efforts to raise awareness, many hemophilia carriers and female persons with hemophilia (PWHs) remain undiagnosed. Between May 2021 and April 2023, we identified potential and obligate carriers of hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) by updating pedigrees of all PWHs followed at the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels. Retrospective data on previously screened females were collected, including bleeding history, coagulation factor levels, and testing for the proband's pathogenic variant. In addition, a proactive approach involved sending 125 invitation letters to unscreened or incompletely screened individuals, through related PWHs. In pedigrees of 287 male PWHs (226 HA and 61 HB) and 7 female index patients from 236 families (184 HA and 52 HB), a total of 900 female individuals were identified. Of those, 454 were obligate and/or genetically proven carriers, and 118 were noncarriers. Genetic testing was conducted in 133 obligate, 237 potential, and 4 sporadic carriers, with 190 obligate and 328 potential carriers remaining untested. Among carriers with known factor levels (261/454), 42 HA (23.0%) and 23 HB carriers (29.5%) had a factor level <40 IU/dL. Carriers with a factor deficiency were screened on average 6 years earlier than other females (P = .034). This study, to our knowledge, represents the first systematic effort to identify potential carriers among families of all PWHs within a single center, emphasizing the challenges in comprehensive screening for female individuals genetically linked to one or more PWHs. Such initiatives are vital for achieving equitable access to hemophilia care for all potentially affected individuals, irrespective of gender. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT05217992."

To determine the contemporary incidence of severe primary PPH in women with VWD and HCs. All women with VWD or HCs who delivered between 2012 and 2017 were selected from all 6 Dutch hemophilia treatment centers. Data on patient and disease characteristics, peripartum hematologic and obstetric management, and outcomes were retrospectively collected. Incidence of severe primary (≥1000 mL of blood loss ≤24 hours after childbirth) and primary (≥500 mL within ≤24 hours after childbirth) PPH was compared with the (1) previous cohort and (2) general Dutch population and between (3) women with VWD and HCs with third-trimester coagulation activity levels <50 international units (IU)/dL vs ≥50 IU/dL and (4) women treated with vs without peripartum hemostatic prophylaxis. Three-hundred forty-eight deliveries (151 VWD, 167 hemophilia A, and 30 hemophilia B carriers) were included. The severe primary PPH incidence was 10% (36/348) and remained stable over time, whereas this incidence has increased in the general population (to 8%), leading to a similar risk (<i>P</i> = .17). Severe primary PPH risk was comparable between women with coagulation activity levels <50 and ≥50 IU/dL (11% [7/66] vs 10% [29/279]; odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.43-2.44) and comparable between those with and those without prophylaxis (12% [11/91] vs 10% [25/254]; odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.59-2.68). Severe primary PPH in women with VWD and HCs remained stable and is comparable with the increasing prevalence in the general population. More research is needed to find the optimal pregnancy management strategy for safe delivery in VWD and HC."

    "title": "Acute Acquired Hemophilia A Following Snake Bite: A Case Report and Clinical Insights.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Coagulopathies can manifest on a spectrum, from minor mucosal bleeding to life-threatening hemorrhage. Minor cases can be discovered in the setting of known risk factors, such as malignancy, old age, immunosuppression. However, acquired hemophilia A diagnosed after a snake bite is of lesser-known incidence and can present in a more acute, potentially life- or limb-threatening fashion. To properly diagnose this coagulopathy, one must be familiar with the related signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings so that swift diagnosis can follow. Diagnosis is key for early proper management, as displayed in the following case. CASE REPORT Our case report details a male patient presenting with diffuse bruising after a snake bite. Initially, on presentation to outside facilities, the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A was not found. However, upon worsening of bruising in the setting of previous treatments initiated for the patient, he presented to our facility, where he subsequently received a diagnosis with acquired hemophilia A. He developed compartment syndrome due to excessive bleeding, requiring surgical intervention. With proper diagnosis, his bleeding diathesis was corrected with multiple rounds of repletion of factors and immunosuppression. His follow-up laboratory test results and examinations have shown continued resolution of his symptoms. CONCLUSIONS As acquired hemophilia A is less often linked with snake bites, this case highlights the importance of considering this disease process as a differential in patients with bleeding diathesis after a snake bite. The coagulation dysfunction can be severe, and, as such, early identification of this diagnosis leads to more targeted and effective therapy."

While it is well known that its plasma activity is underestimated by one-stage clotting assays (OSCA), there is a lack of knowledge on the post-infusion performance of lonoctocog alfa in global coagulation assays or its potential impact on the haemostatic balance in vivo. To characterize lonoctocog alfa versus octocog alfa in pre- and post-infusion samples obtained from patients undergoing repeated investigation of incremental recovery (IR). Eighteen patients with severe haemophilia A (lonoctocog alfa: 10, octocog alfa: 8) were included. A panel of factor-specific and global coagulation assays was applied, comprising a FVIII OSCA, two FVIII chromogenic substrate assays (CSA), rotational thrombelastography and thrombin generation (TG). Potential activation of coagulation was assessed by measuring plasma thrombin markers and levels of activated protein C. Comparable IRs were found for lonoctocog alfa and octocog alfa (2.36 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg] vs. 2.55 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg], respectively). Lonoctocog alfa activities were found to be underestimated by the FVIII OSCA while also the two FVIII CSAs showed statistically significant assay discrepancies on lonoctocog alfa. Effects of both FVIII products on rotational thrombelastography were less distinct than those on TG parameters. No elevated pre- or significantly shifting post-infusion plasma levels of coagulation biomarkers were detected. Lonoctocog alfa and octocog alfa showed comparable recovery and safety in vivo as well as similar impacts on TG in vitro. Observed assay discrepancies on lonoctocog alfa demonstrated variability of results also between different FVIII CSAs."

Reliable measurements can be obtained using most one-stage and chromogenic FVIII assays over a wide concentration range. The efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of damoctocog alfa pegol have been studied extensively in the PROTECT VIII clinical trials, and its long-term safety and effectiveness profile is continuing to build through observational and interventional real-world studies. The PK of damoctocog alfa pegol was shown to be improved as compared with that of sucrose-formulated rFVIII (rFVIII-FS, Kogenate<sup>®</sup>), and was also demonstrated to be non-inferior to and, for some variables, more favorable than rFVIII-Fc fusion protein, efmoroctocog alfa (Elocta<sup>®</sup>; NCT03364998), rurioctocog alfa pegol (BAX 855, Adynovate<sup>®</sup>/Adynovi<sup>®</sup>; NCT04015492), and antihemophilic factor (recombinant) plasma/albumin-free method (rAHF-PFM, Advate<sup>®</sup>; NCT02483208). Damoctocog alfa pegol was generally well tolerated and none of the patients in any of the clinical trials, including the PROTECT VIII clinical program, HEM-POWR, or ongoing single-center studies, developed FVIII inhibitors. Efficacy for perioperative hemostasis has been demonstrated. Low bleeding rates were achieved across the studies, with twice weekly, every 5-day and every 7-day prophylaxis offering patients ≥ 12 years and their clinicians the chance to tailor treatment to individual needs and lifestyles, while maintaining long-term protection from bleeds and their consequences."

To investigate patient and caregiver handling and preference for the concizumab pen-injector compared with current injection systems used to treat hemophilia. This preference and handling study was conducted in accordance with authority guidelines for approval of new devices and included adults and adolescents with HA/HB with or without inhibitors and caregivers currently administering factor replacement therapy or factor VIII mimetic (emicizumab) therapy. All participants underwent a training session, followed by a test session during which participants independently administered a single pen-injection into an injection pad or manikin. Time to train, time to prepare and inject, and number of complete independent injections handling the pen were assessed. Participants evaluated handling and preference via the Hemophilia Device Handling and Preference Assessment Questionnaire. 80 participants (44 adults, 21 adolescents, 15 caregivers) currently using factor replacement therapy (n=41, 51%) or emicizumab (n=39, 49%) participated.

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is an acquired bleeding disorder caused by neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII:C), causing sudden hemorrhagic symptoms (i.e., subcutaneous bleeding, intramuscular bleeding, and hematuria). Herein, this study is aimed at presenting a case of AHA diagnosed based on hematuria and reviewing patients who were diagnosed with AHA due to hematuria. A 67-year-old woman was referred to Atsugi City Hospital with painless gross hematuria that began 4 weeks before presentation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed an approximately 2 cm mass in the right renal pelvis, and the patient's activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was elevated (61.4 s). The day after the endoscopic biopsy, the patient was in shock due to a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Although her condition stabilized after intravenous radioembolization, she underwent emergency surgeries several times because of rebleeding within the next 3 weeks. At that time, APTT was more prolonged at 106.4 s, and the FVIII:C level was 2%. Mixing tests showed an upwardly convex curve after 2-h incubation, indicating the presence of an inhibitor. Factor VIII inhibitor titer was ≥5.1 Bethesda unit (BU)/mL. A combined product of Plasma-Derived Factors VIIa and X (pd-FVIIa/FX), as second-line hemostatic therapy, as well as cyclophosphamide (CYP), were administered after Recombinant Activated Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) had been ineffective. Following this, the Factor VIII inhibitor titer was undetectable, FVIII:C levels were restored, and APTT decreased to within the normal range. Gross hematuria was significantly alleviated. However, the patient died of cytomegalovirus and fungal infections due to prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. Although AHA diagnosed based on hematuria may have a better prognosis than others, there have been occasional cases with severe outcomes. APTT, detected upon initial hematological testing in patients with hematuria, may be a potential indicator of an existing AHA."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Classical hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive disorder, is characterized by an inability to produce factor VIII in normal quantities. This condition, also leading to factor IX deficiency, underpins the bleeding disorder known as hemophilia A. Among the complications of this illness, spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma is rare but can be associated with congenital coagulopathies such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia A. This type of spontaneous internal bleeding has been the subject of a limited number of studies. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old man with a known diagnosis of hemophilia A presented to the Emergency Department exhibiting acute pain in the right lower abdomen. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen identified a right-sided retroperitoneal mass, suspected to be a hematoma. Within 7 h after admission, the patient experienced significant drops in the hemoglobin level and platelet count. He was administered packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet transfusions prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit. There, he was treated with factor VIII and recombinant factor VIIa, coupled with stringent monitoring. Following clinical and laboratory findings and stabilization, he was discharged with specific medications, and a follow-up appointment was scheduled. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma in patients with hemophilia A is a rare and grave emergency. This case underscores the need for precise diagnostic approaches, tailored management strategies, and vigilant surveillance to prevent and mitigate the potentially life-threatening complications associated with spontaneous hemorrhage in this population."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A (HA) is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency/absence of factor VIII (FVIII) and characterised by frequent, acute and prolonged spontaneous or traumatic bleeding events, often leading to haemophilic arthropathy and progressive joint deterioration. HA severity is characterized by endogenous FVIII activity: mild (> 5-40%), moderate (1-5%), or severe (< 1%). HA poses a substantial clinical and socioeconomic burden on people with HA (PWHA), their caregivers, and society. This analysis evaluates clinical and patient-centric outcomes of a cohort of individuals with non-inhibitor HA sampled from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK in the 'Cost of Haemophilia in Europe: A Socioeconomic Survey II' (CHESS II) study. CHESS II was a cross-sectional burden-of-illness study collecting clinical and socioeconomic data on adult (≥ 18 years) individuals with haemophilia A or B of any severity with or without inhibitors from eight European countries. Descriptive analyses were conducted examining physician-reported demographics, clinical and health resource utilisation information. PWHA-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the EQ-5D-5L and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) were also examined. Outcomes were stratified by HA severity and reported at country level. Demographics and clinical characteristics of the cohort (N = 880) were generally consistent across countries. Individuals with severe HA experienced more frequent bleeding events and joint disease despite broad use of factor replacement therapy long-term prophylaxis. A minority of those with mild or moderate HA also experienced such challenges. HRQoL and workforce participation diminished, and chronic pain increased, with increasing HA severity. This analysis provides up-to-date insights on the impact of HA across five European countries. Increasing HA severity was generally associated with worse clinical outcomes, HRQoL and workforce participation. These findings suggest a place for continued evidence-based tailored treatment and clinical management approaches in addressing the residual burden of HA."

For this, age-matched cases of 19 FVIII inhibitor-positive (IP), 21 FVIII inhibitor-negative (IN) and 45 healthy controls were selected for study. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the peripheral lymphocyte subsets, including T, B, natural killer (NK) and NKT cells. The T cell subsets included CD3 + CD4-CD8- [double negative T (DNT)], CD3 + CD4 + CD8+ [double-positive T (DPT)], CD3 + CD4 + CD8- and CD3 + CD4-CD8+ T cells. Pairwise comparisons of absolute lymphocyte subset values were conducted among the three groups. The cut-off value for absolute lymphocyte counts was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The results demonstrated that the absolute values of DPT cells in the IN and IP groups were significantly lower than those in the healthy control group (<i>P = </i>0.007). The DNT values were also lower in severe HA patients with or without inhibitor than those in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant (<i>P = </i>0.053). In addition, the absolute value of CD4+ Th cells in the IP group was lower than that in the healthy controls (<i>P </i>= 0.013). Although not statistically significant (<i>P </i>= 0.064), the absolute values of NKT cells were higher in the IN group compared with the IP group, and higher in the IP group compared with the healthy control group. There were no statistically significant differences in total T, B, CD8 <sup>+ </sup>and NK cells among the IN, IP and healthy control groups. The cut-off value for absolute CD4+ Th cells in the IN group was < 598/µl. The decrease in absolute values of CD4+ Th cells in severe HA patients may contribute to the establishment of infused FVIII immune tolerance. If the CD4+ Th value remains > 598/µl, clinicians should be vigilant for possible FVIII inhibitor production, especially on days prior to FVIII exposure."

Duration of emicizumab treatment was 8 to 639 days (median: 44.5 days) in Cohort 1 and 64 and 450 days in Cohort 2. In both cohorts, no major bleeds were observed after initial emicizumab administration. Six patients started their first rehabilitation sessions during emicizumab treatment and no rehabilitation-related bleeds occurred. Twenty-three surgeries were performed under emicizumab prophylaxis and there were no bleeds related to surgeries. Although asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis was reported in one patient in the primary analysis, no other thrombotic events occurred thereafter. Two patients developed anti-emicizumab antibodies, one of whom showed accelerated emicizumab clearance. Tailored IST approaches (delayed initiation, no use, or reduced dose) were successfully executed in three patients undergoing emicizumab prophylaxis.These results suggest that emicizumab prophylaxis has a favorable benefit-risk profile in PwAHA regardless of eligibility for IST."

Overall, 233 patients (23.9%) switched from an SHL to an EHL product. Although amounts of FVIII prescribed increased in the 3 months after switching, overall, there was no noticeable difference before and after switching. Median total healthcare and FVIII product expenditures increased following switching. Prescribing of EHL products increased over the study and healthcare expenditures increased for patients who switched from SHL to EHL rFVIII products."

    "title": "Evaluating clinically translatable conditioning for platelet gene therapy in murine hemophilia A with inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "Platelet gene therapy is effective in hemophilia A (HA) mice even with inhibitors. Fludarabine (Flu), along with busulfan (Bu) or melphalan (Mel), preconditioning has been shown to be highly effective for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the clinic. To evaluate the efficacy of Bu-Flu and Mel-Flu preconditioning in platelet gene therapy of HA with inhibitors. Bu-Flu and Mel-Flu were used to condition HA mice preimmunized with recombinant human factor (F)VIII. An optimal 660 centigray total body irradiation was used as a control regimen in parallel. Platelet-FVIII expression was introduced by transplantation of 2bF8 lentivirus (LV)-transduced hematopoietic stem cells. Animals were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, FVIII assays, and tail bleeding tests. Bu-Flu, but not Mel-Flu, enabled successful 2bF8 gene therapy. All recipients achieved >55% chimerism post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in both Bu-Flu and 660 centigray groups, with comparable copy numbers of 2bF8 cassette and the platelet-FVIII levels. The bleeding phenotype was rescued in 2bF8LV-transduced recipients. FVIII inhibitor titers declined with time, with comparable disappearance time of inhibitors between the 2 groups. When animals were rechallenged with recombinant human FVIII after the titers dropped to undetectable levels, no inhibitors were detected in 2bF8LV-transduced recipients. In contrast, all untransduced transplanted control mice produced inhibitors. These data demonstrate that immune tolerance was established in 2bF8LV-transduced primed HA mice under Bu-Flu conditioning. Bu-Flu preconditioning allows for successfully introducing platelet-FVIII expression to restore hemostasis and induce immune tolerance in primed HA mice, suggesting that this approach is a promising clinically translatable strategy for gene therapy of HA with inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Hemophilic pseudotumor (HP) is a very rare complication of hemophilia seen in only 1-2% of the cases. Although it is much more common in long bones, pelvis and small bones of hands and feet and very rarely involving jaw bones. In the present case, the presence of a rare hemophilic pseudotumor of the mandible with the positive history of Hemophilia B justifies that the history, clinical and radiological examinations were sufficient to arrive at conclusive diagnosis precluding invasive diagnostic procedures such as biopsy hence avoiding the risk of hemorrhage, infection, or fistula. This case also highlights that patient was conservatively managed with Factor IX replacement alone with a very good clinical outcome. HP should be considered as a differential diagnosis of any progressive swelling of hard and soft tissues occurring in a patient with severe haemophilia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene, resulting in deficient or dysfunctional factor VIII (FVIII). This study aimed to characterize the mutational profile of HA in Romanian patients using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). A total of 107 patients were analyzed, revealing pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 96.3% of cases. The identified mutations included missense (30.5%), nonsense (9.1%), small deletions (6.4%), small insertions (2.1%), splice-site variants (4.3%), large deletions (1.6%), and large duplications (1.1%). Large intron inversion was previously found in 37.5% of the patients. Novel variants accounted for 21.5% of identified mutations, expanding the spectrum of F8 variants in this population. This study underscores the genetic heterogeneity of HA and provides insights into genotype-phenotype correlations, aiding in clinical management and prenatal diagnosis."

A prospective survey was conducted in three different hospitals of Benin from April 2021 to March 2022, to analyse clinical and biological features of patients with haemophilia previously diagnosed or identified based on personal/family history. A total of 101 patients were studied, 97 with haemophilia A and 4 with haemophilia B, including 26 new cases identified after family investigation. Their median age was 11 years, and the most frequent initial manifestations were cutaneous-mucosal haemorrhages (29.70%) and post-circumcision haemorrhages (25.74%). Previous joint bleedings were present in 77% of them, with an arthropathy in 65 cases, which particularly affected the knees (75%), elbows (41%) and ankles (29%). Factor VIII (FVIII) levels combined with activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values did not always enable, as would be expected, the distinction between severe and moderate haemophilia, since they were >1 IU/dl in 31 of 74 patients with APTT > 80 s, and between 1 and 2 IU/dl in 26 other cases with previous joint haemorrhages, including 18 with chronic arthropathy. Therefore, for these patients, severe haemophilia could not be excluded, and this uncertainty probably reflects technical difficulties affecting the pre-analytical and analytical stages of the APTT and FVIII/IX assays. Our study proved that haemophilia is a significant reality in Benin, but also remains under-diagnosed in some districts of the country. In addition, more reliable biological tests are needed in the future to better define the severity of the disease and improve treatment of patients."

    "abstract": "The Chinese Haemophilia Individualized Prophylaxis Study (CHIPS), which was launched in 2016, reported a significant reduction in haemarthrosis over a one-year study. However, its long-term efficacy requires verification. This paper summarizes the clinical outcomes of 18 severe haemophilia A (SHA) patients who completed one year on the CHIPS and 3 more years of follow-up. Clinical follow-up was based on the CHIPS protocol (from July 2018 to July 2021). Escalation was based on index joint bleeding, and serial ultrasound (greyscale and colour Doppler) examinations of the index joints (both sides of the ankles, knees and elbows) were conducted every 6 months via a scoring system. A total of 18 SHA patients completed the 3-year study. Fifteen patients dropped out due to the financial crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The median age was 5.4 (range 4.3-6.9) years. A significant reduction in haemarthrosis was achieved, with mean annual bleeding rates reduced from 18.9 ± 2.8 to 1.7 ± 0.4 (p < 0.001), annual joint bleeding rates from 3.1 ± 0.7 to1.2 ± 0.3 (p < 0.028). 5 out of 8 target joint resolved. Sixteen doses were escalated. At study exit, the heterogeneous treatment outcomes of the SHA boys were 5 at step 4 (20-25 lU/kg, every other day), 10 at step 3 (15-20 IU/kg, 3×/week), 2 at step 2 (10-15 lU/kg, 3×/week) and 1 at step 1 (10-15 lU/kg, 2×/week). The mean FVIII consumption was 2964 IU/kg/year, with savings. The quality of life improved, with Canadian Haemophilia Outcomes-Kids Life Assessment Tool (CHO-KLAT, Chinese Version 2.0) scores ranging from 68.8 to 78.8. There was no change in the ultrasound score. Our follow-up data on the 18 SHA boys after completing one year on the CHIPS verify the long-term efficacy of the CHIPS for haemarthrosis reduction, joint health preservation, improvement in the quality of life of the boys and cost savings."

We speculated that activated protein C (APC) and antithrombin (AT) resistance might be associated with these adverse events. To investigate APC and AT resistance in factor (F)VIII-deficient (FVIIIdef) plasma in the presence of emicizumab and APCC. In pooled normal plasma or FVIIIdef plasma samples mixed with emicizumab (50 μg/mL) and FVIII-bypassing agents, including recombinant FVIIa (2.2 μg/mL), APCC (1.3 IU/mL), or plasma-derived FVIIa/FX (1.5 μg/mL), the suppression effect of AT (0-2.4 μM) and APC (0-16 nM) was assessed by tissue factor-triggered thrombin generation assay. The APC effects in FVIIIdef plasma with the copresence of emicizumab, FII (1.3 μM), and/or FIXa (280 pM) were also examined. The AT resistance in emicizumab and each bypassing agent was not observed. Moreover, APC dose-dependent suppression effect was observed in pooled normal plasma or FVIIIdef plasma mixed with emicizumab and recombinant FVIIa or plasma-derived FVIIa/FX. However, APC-catalyzed inactivation had little effect on thrombin generation assay potential in FVIIIdef plasma spiked with emicizumab and APCC. The addition of FIXa to emicizumab in FVIIIdef plasma could lead to partial APC resistance. Furthermore, FVIIIdef plasma spiked with emicizumab, FIXa, and FII was markedly resistant to APC-mediated inactivation. FII and FIXa in APCCs were key clotting factors for APC resistance in FVIIIdef plasma supplemented with emicizumab and APCCs. The APC resistance in persons with hemophilia A receiving emicizumab and APCC may contribute to venous thromboembolic events."

    "abstract": "We describe a 67-year-old patient with hemophilia A and inhibitors (PwHA-I) receiving emicizumab prophylaxis who underwent surgical treatment for pseudoaneurysm. He was treated with a bolus infusion of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa; 79 μg/kg) immediately before surgery, and a second dose of rFVIIa after an initial treatment on day 1. A third rFVIIa bolus was infused 17 h after the second dose on day 2, and the treatment was continued every 24 h on day 3 and day 4. Treatment with rFVIIa was discontinued on day 4. No perioperative bleeding or thrombotic events were observed. Coagulation potentials at 8 h after rFVIIa administration determined by clot waveform analysis (CWA) and thrombin generation assay (TGA) were within near-normal ranges, and results at 17 h after rFVIIa administration showed coagulation function comparable to that in the patient without rFVIIa. Our experimental data suggest that the coagulation potential in FVIII-deficient plasma spiked with both 0.28 µg/mL (11.2 μg/kg) rFVIIa and emicizumab was equivalent to or greater than that spiked with 2.2 µg/mL (90 μg/kg) rFVIIa alone. Thus, administration of rFVIIa every 8 h may be feasible for managing perioperative treatment in emicizumab-treated PwHA-I."

This study estimated the direct and indirect costs per patient with hemophilia A in Brazil and evaluated the cost variability across different age groups. A prospective observational research was conducted with retrospective data collection of patients assisted at three referral blood centers in Brazil. Time-driven Activity-based Costing method was used to analyze direct costs, while indirect costs were estimated based on interviews with family and caregivers. Cost per patient was analyzed according to age categories, stratified into 3 groups (0-11;12-18 or older than 19 years old). The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to confirm the differences in costs across groups. Data from 140 hemophilia A patients were analyzed; 53 were 0-11 years, 29 were 12-18 years, and the remaining were older than 19 years. The median cost per patient per year was R$450,831 (IQR R$219,842; R$785,149; $174,566), being possible to confirm age as a cost driver: older patients had higher costs than younger's (p = 0.001; median cost: 0-11 yrs R$299,320; 12-18 yrs R$521,936; ≥19 yrs R$718,969). This study is innovative in providing cost information for hemophilia A using a microcosting technique. The variation in costs across patient age groups can sustain more accurate health policies driven to increase access to cutting-edge technologies and reduce the burden of the disease."

This study aims to elucidate the morphological characteristics of distal femur in hemophilic arthritis (HA) and compare the compatibility of three types of prostheses with the anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) dimensions of the femoral osteotomy surface. This study retrospectively and randomly selected 50 patients with HA registered for treatment at our hospital from June 2016 to August 2022 as the study subjects, with an equal number of male osteoarthritis (OA) patients and healthy male individuals set as the control group. This study used medical digitalization software to simulate osteotomies on the distal femur during total knee arthroplasties (TKA) for 50 patients with HA, OA patients, and the healthy population, respectively, and measure the morphological parameters to compare with three commonly used femoral components of TKA in clinical practice. The differences between the femur resection of anteroposterior and mediolateral (FRAP, FRML) osteotomy surface and the prosthesis's BOX-AP/ML were compared in three prostheses. One-way ANOVA and multiple Kruskal-Wallis H test were used for the normal or non-normal distribution data, and pairwise comparisons between groups were conducted using the Bonferroni method, and the linear correlation analysis was utilized to assess the relationship between section femoral morphological data and prosthesis parameters. In HA patients, the morphological characteristics of the distal femur were shown as shorter than femur AP (FAP), medial and lateral condyle anterior-posterior dimension (FMCAP, FLCAP), notch width (NW), posterolateral condyle height (PLCH), posteromedial condyle width (PMCW), and posterior condylar axis length (PCAL) dimension. They had comparatively smaller femur section aspect ratios (p < 0.005). They showed longer posterolateral condyle width (PLCW), anterior condyle mediolateral dimension (FRACML), anterolateral condyle height (ALCH), and femur resection anterior condylar mediolateral (FRACML) dimension (p < 0.005). They showed larger distal femur aspect ratio and resection aspect ratio (FAR, FRAR, p < 0.005). All selected prostheses showed ML undercoverage under similar AP dimensions, and ML undersizing of Attune systems was more obvious in three femoral prostheses. The distal femur morphological change of HA patient is shown as smaller AP dimension, narrow posterior condyle spacing, lower and shallower trochlear, thinner anterior condyle, wider and lower intercondylar notch and higher posterior-lateral condyle. The selected prostheses showed ML undercoverage under similar AP dimensions. This typical morphological tendency of the distal femur seems to warrant consideration in the process of knee joint prosthesis upgrading."

Longitudinal integration analysis suggested integrations occur primarily within 1 week, at low frequency, and their abundance was stable over time. Integration profiles were polyclonal and randomly distributed. No major differences in integration profiles were observed for either vector production platform, and no integrations were associated with clonal expansion. Integrations were enriched near transcription start sites of genes highly expressed in the liver (<i>p</i> = 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and less enriched for genes of lower expression. We found no evidence of tumorigenesis or fibrosis caused by the vector integrations."

PREVENT (NCT03055611), a noninterventional study across 25 German hemophilia treatment centers, enrolled previously treated persons with hemophilia A and B (all ages/severities) on individualized rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc prophylaxis before/at enrollment. Primary endpoints included annualized bleeding rate (ABR), injection frequency (IF), and factor consumption (FC). Additionally, up to 12 months of retrospective FVIII/FIX data were collected.

Most physicians and patients were satisfied or highly satisfied with rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc. rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc were well tolerated, with no inhibitor development or treatment-related serious adverse events. Real-world PREVENT data complement phase 3 trials and show that individualized rFVIIIFc/rFIXFc prophylaxis provided stable bleed protection with low IF and maintained FC. Compared with previous FVIII, ABR was considerably reduced with rFVIIIFc, with stable annualized FC. For rFIXFc, bleed protection was maintained vs previous FIX while reducing annualized IF."

The majority of patients receiving concizumab expressed a preference for concizumab over their previous treatment, the main reasons being \"fewer bleeds,\" \"require less time,\" and \"less painful to inject.\" Across all PROs, there were less responses collected than anticipated, limiting interpretations. PROs collected during the explorer7 study showed improvements in some domains of HRQoL, treatment burden, and patient treatment preference in persons with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors receiving concizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, adverse events, and neuromuscular and perceptual responses to an acute session of low load (LL) knee extensions with BFR in PwH under prophylaxis. Eight PwH performed one LL-BFR session with 40% arterial occlusion pressure (AOP). Perceptual responses and adverse effects were assessed, together with high-density surface electromyography of vastus medialis (VM) and lateralis (VL). Significant normalized root mean square differences were found within each set, but not between sets. Spatial distribution (centroid displacement (p > .05), modified entropy (VM, set two, cycles three and five, p = .032) and coefficient of variation (VM, set two, cycles four and five lower than cycle three (p = .049; p = .036)) showed changes within each set. Median frequency showed a slight increase during cycle four of set four (p = .030). Rate of perceived exertion slightly increased with each set while tolerability slightly decreased in the last set and fear of training with BFR generally decreased after the session. In PwH, a LL-BFR session at 40% AOP is safe and feasible. Our results suggest that potential muscle impairments may blunt neuromuscular adaptations induced by BFR."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapy provides a promising platform for treatment of monogenic inherited disorders. Clinical studies have demonstrated long-term expression with reduction in bleeding using this approach for the treatment of hemophilia. Despite these advances, there are unknowns surrounding the natural history of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors and the cellular mechanisms mediating vector persistence. These unknowns underpin questions regarding long-term efficacy and safety. The predominant mechanism via which AAV is proposed to persist is in circular double-stranded extrachromosomal DNA structures (episomes) within the nucleus. Studies of wild-type AAV (WT-AAV) and rAAV have demonstrated that AAV also persists via integration into a host cell's DNA. It is important to determine whether these integration events can mediate expression or could result in any long-term safety concerns. WT-AAV infection affects a large proportion of the general population, which is thought to have no long-term sequelae. Recent studies have highlighted that this WT-AAV has been detected in cases of acute hepatitis in children and in a minority of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Integration following treatment using rAAV has also been reported in preclinical and clinical studies. There have been variable reports on the potential implications of integration for rAAV vectors, with data in some murine studies demonstrating recurrent integration with development of hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings have not been seen in other preclinical or clinical studies. In this review, we will summarize current understanding of the natural history of AAV (wild-type and recombinant) with a focus on genomic integration and cellular implications."

More than half of patients with AHA cannot identify underlying disorders. The remaining patients are associated with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, skin diseases, infections, and medications. Here, we present a case of 56-year-old Korean man with underlying hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus who developed AHA following the second dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. He presented with a large 20 × 30 cm-sized hematoma along the psoas muscle and intracranial hemorrhage, necessitating intensive care with mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy. Laboratory testing demonstrated that activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin times were 74.7 seconds (normal range 29-43 seconds) and 17.2 seconds (normal range 12.5-14.7 seconds), respectively. Laboratory tests confirmed AHA with undetectable factor VIII activity (<1.5%) and a positive factor VIII antibody with a titer of 8.49 Bethesda units/mL. Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven®) was administered every 2 hours to control the bleeding, alongside immunosuppression with methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg daily and cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg daily to eliminate the autoantibody. Despite the treatments, the patient developed sepsis and succumbed 14 weeks after admission. This rare case underscores the importance of monitoring for AHA following COVID-19 vaccination. Although the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination, AHA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unusual bleeding following the vaccinations. Early diagnosis and management before severe bleeding are critical for successfully controlling life-threatening bleeding."

Treatment of HA over the last decade has benefited from an improved understanding of FVIII biology, including its secretion pathway, its interaction with von Willebrand factor in circulation, the biochemical nature of its FIXa cofactor activity, the regulation of activated FVIII by inactivation pathways, and its surprising immunogenicity. This has facilitated biotechnology innovations with first-in-class examples of several new therapeutic modalities recently receiving regulatory approval for HA, including FVIII-mimetic bispecific antibodies and recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector-based gene therapy. Biological insights into FVIII also guide the development and use of gain-of-function FVIII variants aimed at addressing the limitations of first-generation rAAV vectors for HA. Several gain-of-function FVIII variants designed to have improved secretion are currently incorporated in second-generation rAAV vectors and have recently entered clinical trials. Continued mutually reinforcing advancements in the understanding of FVIII biology and treatments for HA are necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of hemophilia therapy: normalizing hemostasis and optimizing well-being with minimal treatment burden for all patients worldwide."

    "abstract": "To assess risk factors of retroperitoneal and lower extremity musculoskeletal bleed in acquired haemophilia (AHA) and perform an objective assessment of disability and influence on survival. We included 49 patients with AHA from November 2017 to May 2023. The occurrence of any retroperitoneal or/and lower extremities bleeding manifestation was investigated. On clinical follow-up, we search for compressive femoral neuropathy and quadriceps amyotrophy. The lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) was carried out one year after the last bleeding event in all AHA patients. A 61.2% of patients in our AHA cohort presented with any retroperitoneal and/or lower extremities musculoskeletal manifestation. Those patients had higher percentage of major bleeding EACH2/ISTH criteria (90% vs. 57%, p = .01), needs of blood transfusions (86% vs. 57% of patients, p = .03), and haemostatic by-pass products (90% vs. 63%, p = .02). Hypertension (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.9, p = .02), presence of autoimmune disease (HR 13, 95% CI 1.7-99, p = .01), and inhibitor level > 20 BU (HR 2.6 95% CI 1.0-6.8, p = .04) significantly predicted retroperitoneal/lower extremities clinical manifestations. Most frequent sequelae were quad atrophy (30.6%) and femoral nerve palsy (20.4%). Quad atrophy and LEFS scores under 50 were associated with increased mortality (HR 3, 95% CI 1.1-8.6 and HR 12, 95% CI 3.3-45, respectively). AHA with retroperitoneal/lower extremities bleeding involvement is of greater severity and shows high disability and worst survival outcomes. Quadriceps atrophy and LEFS scale scoring under 50 predicted mortality in our AHA patients."

    "abstract": "Raising awareness of acquired hemophilia A (AHA) and early diagnosis is critical to reduce the associated mortality rate. We aimed to characterize acquired hemophilia in Chinese patients and evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The clinical characteristics, laboratory test data, therapeutic approaches, and outcomes of 20 patients with AHA who were admitted to Xi'an Central Hospital between January 2012 and December 2020 were retrospectively studied. Nine of the patients (45%) were treated by single glucocorticoid administration; three (15%) with cyclophosphamide (CP) in combination with a glucocorticoid; four individuals (20%) received a combination therapy of rituximab with CP and glucocorticoid or rituximab with CP, vincristine, and a glucocorticoid; three (15%) by injection of human immunoglobulin in combination with a glucocorticoid; and one (5%) with CP alone. Six patients (30%) achieved total remission and 11 (55%) partial remission (PR), but three (15%) did not enter remission, indicating an objective response rate of 85%. Combination therapy with rituximab or intravenous human immunoglobulin achieves superior results in some patients with AHA. Immunosuppression and the administration of coagulation factors can rapidly control the disease and are efficacious, but >50% of patients only achieved PR. These findings suggest that the complete elimination of inhibitors requires prolonged immunosuppression therapy."

    "abstract": "Haemophilic arthropathy (HArt) is a serious complication in patients with hemophilia. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to minimise the development of HArt. The use of biomarkers may improve early diagnosis of HArt. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAsthat regulate gene expression, and are being investigated as promising biomarkers due to their role in joint and bone metabolism. To investigate differential expression of miRNAs and their relationship to arthropathy in patients with hemophilia A. miRNA expression was examined in a pilot study followed by a validation study (100 hemophilia A patients with [n = 83] and without HArt [n = 17], 14 controls). Differential miRNA expression was investigated using real-time quantitative PCR. The pilot study identified 2 miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with Hart (Pettersson score ≥ 1), after adjusting for the false discovery rate (FDR). The validation study evaluated these 2 miRNAs. The results demonstrated that two miRNAs (miR- 208a-3p and 524-3p) were significantly underexpressed in plasma of patients with HArt compared to patients without arthropathy, with FDR <0.05 (Fig. 1). In addition, 3 miRNAs (130a-3p, miR- and 506-3p) were significantly underexpressed in patients with moderate HArt (Pettersson score 4 to 7). In this proof of concept study we identified a signature of 5 circulating miRNAs associated with Hart with potential as diagnosis tools for HArt. These miRNAs are potential negative regulators of gene expression, suggesting their activity in HArt by interfering with osteoblastic (miR- 208a-3p) and osteoclastic (miR-506-3p) differentiation to impair bone mineralization and remodeling processes, or regulating chondrogenesis (miR-335-5p). miRNAs associated with earlier stages of HArt will be further investigated in a sub-study of the prospective clinical trial PROVE, which will investigate the effects of long-term prophylaxis with simoctocog alfa versus emicizumab in adults with hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "Ocular hemorrhage has been recorded in congenital factor deficiencies like hemophilia A, but it has never been documented in prothrombin deficiency. Here, we describe an unusual case of sudden vision loss in the right eye caused by subretinal hemorrhage following a coughing episode in a 67-year-old woman. Notably, the patient underwent left eye enucleation 12 years previously under similar circumstances due to subretinal hemorrhage. During the interview, it was discovered that the patient had a history of prothrombin deficiency, which was subsequently confirmed through laboratory testing. Aside from recurrent ocular bleeding and 1 instance of bleeding following dental extraction in childhood, there is no other history of bleeding. Subsequent molecular studies revealed a homozygous missense mutation at G1499A (Arg500Gln), a variant previously identified as R457Q. Although the likelihood of prothrombin deficiency initiating subretinal hemorrhage is low, it is likely to worsen retinal hemorrhage and contribute to difficulty in controlling bleeding. A comprehensive coagulation workup is essential in patients with ocular hemorrhage. Determining factor II activity should be included in individuals exhibiting variably prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time with correction in mixing studies. Additional investigations, such as genetic sequencing and family studies, are advised for those with isolated low prothrombin levels."

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and related factors in children with severe hemophilia A (HA) who received regular low-dose prophylaxis. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical data of severe HA children who began to receive regular low-dose coagulation factor Ⅷ (FⅧ) prophylaxis in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2011 were retrospectively enrolled. The longest last follow-up period was May 31, 2023. The attendance of school or work and daily physical activity during the last follow-up were investigated. The patients were divided into full attendance group and incomplete attendence group according to attendance. The patients were divided into into exercise attainment group (reached Chinese sports recommendation) and exercise nonattainment group according to the exercise status. Barthel score was used to assess activities of daily living and Haemo-QoL was used to assess quality of life. Long-term HRQoL for children aged 8-16 years and patients aged 17 years and above were assessed using Haemo-QoL SF and Haem-A-QoL versions, respectively. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between treatment conditions and Haemo-QoL scores. <b>Results:</b> A total of 22 cases were enrolled, the prophylaxis initiation age ranged from 1.8-17.9 (10.4±3.8) years old. The average prophylactic FⅧ dose during low-dose prophylaxis was 24.2 U/kg per week and the follow-up time was 6.3-15.1 (9.6±2.8) years. At the last follow-up, the age of the patients was (20.2±5.4) years, of which 14 (63.6%) were adults over 18 years old. There were 15 patients in the full attendance group and 7 patients in the incomplete attendence group. Compared with the full attendance group, the incomplete attendence group had a smaller preventive treatment dose [<i>M</i>(<i>Q</i><sub>1,</sub> <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>), (28.4±11.1) vs (15.3±3.7) U/kg, <i>P</i>=0.012], shorter preventive treatment time [148. 1 (18.6, 346.5) vs 48.0 (32.0, 156.9) weeks, <i>P</i>=0.017], and higher annual joint bleeding rate (AJBR) [12.5 (6.0, 22.3) vs 14.2 (13.2, 17.8) times, <i>P</i>=0.017]. There were 7 cases in the exercise attainment group and 15 cases in the exercise nonattainment group. Compared to the exercise attainment group, the exercise nonattainment group had shorter preventive treatment time[313. 7 (156.9, 366.0) vs 48.0 (16.5, 108.9) weeks, <i>P</i>=0.006], a higher AJBR [7.0 (5.1, 10.0) vs 23.3 (12.5, 29.8), <i>P</i>=0.003] and a higher hemophilia joint health score (HJHS) [9.0 (2.0, 15.5) vs 23.0 (12.0, 27.8), <i>P</i>=0.014]. Barthel score showed 81.8% (18 cases) of the patients' living ability was not influenced by the illness. In Haemo-QoL score, the total score of Haemo-QoL SF in 7 cases was (47.6±17.0) scores, the total score of Haem-A-QoL in 15 cases was (45.2±22.6) scores. The daily activity dimension of the Haem-A-QoL score was the lowest [38.2 (10.9, 45.5) scores], which was positively correlated with the starting age of prophylactic initiation (<i>r</i>=0.501, <i>P</i>=0.057), and negatively correlated with the duration of prophylaxis (<i>r</i>=-0.545, <i>P</i>=0.036). <b>Conclusions:</b> Regular low-dose prophylaxis could improve the long-term HRQoL of some children with severe HA, and children with higher prophylactic doses and longer prophylactic treatment time have higher quality of life."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia A (HA; Factor VIII deficiency) is a congenital X-linked bleeding disorder characterized by trauma-related or spontaneous bleeding events, most notably arising within the intraarticular space and resulting in chronic inflammation and degeneration of affected joints. Endogenous clotting factor activity relative to normal levels determines the severity of HA symptoms, as mild (> 5-40%), moderate (1-5%), or severe (< 1%). Within the current environment of rapid evolution in HA management, we seek to understand the interplay of condition severity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to characterise and differentiate unmet needs among people with HA (PwHA). A generalised linear regression model (GLM) was developed to explore the relationship between HA severity and EQ-5D-5 L index score from adult HA patients sampled in the \"Cost of Haemophilia across Europe - a Socioeconomic Survey II\" (CHESS II) cross-sectional, retrospective burden of illness study among adults with hereditary haemophilia A or B from eight European countries. HA patients of any severity with no active inhibitors during the 12 months prior to data capture and a completeEQ-5D-5 L response were included. A base GLM model was specified with covariates for demographic and clinical characteristics (age, body mass index, country, employment, HA severity, annual bleeding rate, problem joints, and chronic pain). Of 381 evaluable patients, 221 (58.0%) had severe HA, 96 (25.2%) had moderate HA, and 64 (16.8%) had mild HA. Among the covariates included in the GLM model and after controlling for haemophilia-related outcomes, a significant association was observed between mild HA and higher EQ-5D-5 L index score (average marginal effects, 0.084; p = 0.016) relative to severe HA. Patient country of residence and magnitude of HA-related chronic pain were also associated with significant differences in index scores, with the latter showing a negative relationship with HRQoL outcomes. Condition severity and chronic pain are significant predictors of HRQoL in PwHA. Durable bleeding protection and effective management of chronic pain have the potential to address unmet treatment needs in this population."

Postoperatively, effective pain management, continued hemostatic therapy, and individualized rehabilitation programs are vital for facilitating recovery and preventing complications. Close monitoring for potential complications, such as periprosthetic joint infection and recurrent hemarthrosis, allows for prompt intervention when necessary. Overall, a collaborative approach involving hematologists, orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and rehabilitation specialists ensures comprehensive care tailored to the unique needs of patients with hemophilia undergoing joint replacement surgery, ultimately optimizing outcomes and improving quality of life. This holistic approach addresses the multifaceted challenges posed by hemophilia and joint replacement surgery, providing patients with the best possible chance for successful outcomes and long-term joint function. By integrating specialized expertise from multiple disciplines and implementing evidence-based strategies, healthcare providers can effectively manage hemophilia in the context of joint replacement surgery, mitigating risks and maximizing benefits for patients."

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of fibrin sealant against traditional methods for achieving hemostasis post dental surgery. The medical records of patients with factor VIII or IX deficiency, or von Willebrand disease, who underwent dental procedures in the Department of Dentistry, Seth GSMC and KEM Hospital, were evaluated for inclusion in this retrospective matched cohort study. Cohort-1 included those treated with a fibrin sealant (Tisseel Lyo) with/without traditional hemostatic measures post-procedure, while cohort-2 (controls) included those in whom no fibrin sealant was used. A total of 128 patients, 64 in each group, were evaluated. There was no statistically significant difference in demographics, disease-related variables, dental complaints, or preoperative treatment given between the groups. However, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the requirement for secondary procedures for hemostasis (suturing, gel foam application, and/or cauterization) and postoperative requirement for factor replacement (P = 0.003) in the fibrin glue group as compared to the controls. In this study, fibrin sealant demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating the necessity for active hemostasis control."

There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit the production of anti-FVIII inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) in HA. This study aimed to investigate a combination monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy targeting CXCL13 and CD20 on the development of anti-FVIII antibodies in a HA murine model, along with the underlying mechanisms involved. Specifically, mAbs targeting mouse CD20 (18B12) with an IgG2a backbone and mouse CXCL13 (2C4) with an IgG1 backbone were synthesized. HA mice with FVIII inhibitors were established, and the results revealed that the combination therapy of anti-mCD20 with α-mCXCL13 significantly suppressed anti-FVIII antibody development and induced FVIII tolerance. Furthermore, this combination therapy led to a marked reduction of peripheral and splenic follicular helper T cells and an enhancement of regulatory T cell induction, along with sustained depletion of bone marrow and splenic plasma cells in HA mice with preexisting FVIII immunity. Thus, the concurrence of blockage of CD20 and neutralization of CXCL13 hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for HA patients with inhibitors."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder (1.4 per million inhabitants per year) caused by neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII. Although uncommon, these autoantibodies can cause a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Several conditions are linked with AHA; based on an EACH2 study, 3.8% of AHA could be connected to infection. In the last four years, most humans have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection or have been vaccinated against it. Whether or not COVID-19 immunization might induce AHA remains controversial. This review aims to evaluate the evidence about this possible association. Overall, 18 manuscripts (2 case series and 16 case reports) were included. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as also happens with other vaccines, may stimulate an autoimmune response. However, older individuals with various comorbidities are both at risk of developing AHA and of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine must always be administered because the benefits still outweigh the risks. Yet, we should consider the rare possibility that the activation of an immunological response through vaccination may result in AHA. Detailed registries and prospective studies would be necessary to analyze this post-vaccine acquired bleeding disorder, looking for possible markers and underlying risk factors for developing the disease in association with vaccination."

    "abstract": "Navigating through antithrombotic therapy in patients with both hemophilia and cardiovascular pathology presents a complex scenario with inherent challenges and opportunities. The presence of hemophilia, characterized by impaired blood clotting, adds a layer of complexity to the management of cardiovascular conditions requiring antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation. Striking a delicate balance between the necessity for antithrombotic treatment to prevent cardiovascular events and the heightened risk of severe bleeding in individuals with hemophilia demands a nuanced and carefully considered approach. The challenges revolve around identifying an optimal therapeutic strategy that effectively mitigates cardiovascular risks without exacerbating bleeding tendencies. In hemophilic patients with cardiovascular disease, the decision to use antiplatelet therapy requires careful consideration of the individual's bleeding risk profile, considering factors such as the severity of hemophilia, history of bleeding episodes, and concurrent medications. The goal is to provide effective antithrombotic treatment while minimizing the potential for excessive bleeding complications. Conventional anticoagulants like warfarin pose difficulties due to their potential to increase the risk of bleeding. On the other hand, emerging options like novel direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) present an opportunity, offering predictable pharmacokinetics and user-friendly administration. However, a comprehensive exploration of their safety and efficacy in hemophilic patients is imperative. Achieving the right equilibrium between preventing cardiovascular events and minimizing bleeding risk is pivotal in selecting the most effective therapeutic option for individuals with hemophilia and cardiovascular pathology. A multidisciplinary approach, integrating the expertise of hematologists and cardiologists, becomes essential to customize treatments and address the intricacies of this medical challenge."

    "abstract": "One of the well-known X-linked genetic disorders is hemophilia, which could be hemophilia A as a result of a mutation in the <i>F8</i> (factor VIII) gene or hemophilia B as a result of a mutation in the <i>F9</i> (factor IX) gene, leading to insufficient levels of the proteins essential for blood coagulation cascade. In patients with severe hemophilia, factor VIII or factor IX activities in the blood plasma are considerably low, estimated to be less than 1%. This is responsible for spontaneous or post-traumatic bleeding episodes, or both, leading to disease complications and death. Current treatment of hemophilia relies on the prevention of bleeding, which consists of expensive lifelong replacement infusion therapy of blood plasma clotting factors, their recombinant versions, or therapy with recombinant monoclonal antibodies. Recently emerged gene therapy approaches may be a potential game changer that could reshape the therapeutic outcomes of hemophilia A or B using a one-off vector in vivo delivery and aim to achieve long-term endogenous expression of factor VIII or IX. This review examines both traditional approaches to the treatment of hemophilia and modern methods, primarily focusing on gene therapy, to update knowledge in this area. Recent technological advances and gene therapeutics in the pipeline are critically reviewed and summarized. We consider gene therapy to be the most promising method as it may overcome the problems associated with more traditional treatments, such as the need for constant and expensive infusions and the presence of an immune response to the antibody drugs used to treat hemophilia."

To develop a single-domain antibody (sdAb) directed against ZPI to inhibit its anticoagulant activity. We screened for anti-ZPI sdAbs in a llama-derived phage display immune library of sdAbs. The sdAbs that bound ZPI were produced and purified for characterization. The binding of sdAbs to ZPI or other serpins was evaluated using ELISAs, and ZPI inhibition was measured in an anti-FXa or anti-FXIa chromogenic assay. The sdAbs's procoagulant activity was assessed in a thrombin generation assay in normal plasma, factor VIII- and FXI-deficient plasma. Of the four sdAbs found to bind to ZPI, one (referred to as ZPI-sdAb2) dose-dependently inhibited ZPI's anti-FXa and anti-FXIa activities with a mean half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.8 and 1.3 µM, respectively. ZPI-sdAb2 did not cross-react with other plasma serpins, such as antithrombin and α1-antitrypsin. ZPI-sdAb2 induced a significant increase in thrombin generation in plasma samples from healthy donors, patients with severe hemophilia A, and patients with FXI deficiency. ZPI-sdAb2 is the first specific, direct ZPI inhibitor found to exhibit procoagulant activity in plasma. This sdAb might have potential as a treatment for hemophilia or other bleeding disorders."

The samples were analyzed using overall hemostatic potential (OHP), and calibrated automated thrombogram, Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT). Nine patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors were included. Spiking with rFVIIa normalized the coagulation potential in 6/8 samples, in 3 only with high dose. Only one sample did not improve adequately after spiking with aPCC. The improvement in hemostasis was reliably shown by both CAT and OHP. The baseline potential was, however, more often measurable by OHP compared to CAT. Factor concentrate had been administered to 5 patients normalizing the hemostatic potential in vivo in 2 (without spiking).

Hemophilia requires complex management. To date, there is no evidence-based clinical practice guideline on hemophilia treatment based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This evidence-based clinical practice guideline from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis aims to provide an overview of evidence and support patients, caregivers, hematologists, pediatricians, other clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders in treatment decisions about congenital hemophilia A and B. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of physicians and patients with global representation, balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel prioritized a set of clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. A methodological team supported the guideline development process, including searching for evidence and performing systematic reviews. The GRADE approach was used, including GRADE Evidence to Decision frameworks. The recommendations were subject to public comment. The panel selected 13 questions, of which 11 addressed the treatment of hemophilia A and 2 the treatment of hemophilia B. Specifically, the panel addressed questions on prophylactic and episodic treatment with FVIII concentrates, bypassing agents, and nonfactor therapy (emicizumab) for hemophilia A (with and without inhibitors) as well as immune tolerance induction for hemophilia A. For hemophilia B, the panel addressed questions on prophylactic and episodic treatment of bleeding events with FIX concentrates. Agreement was reached for all 13 recommendations, of which 7 (54%) were based on evidence from randomized clinical trials, 3 (23%) on observational studies, and 3 (23%) on indirect comparisons. Strong recommendations were issued for prophylactic over episodic treatment for severe and moderately severe hemophilia A and B. Only conditional recommendations were issued for the remaining questions. Future research should focus on direct treatment comparisons and the treatment of hemophilia B with and without inhibitors. Future updates of this guideline will provide an updated evidence synthesis on the current questions and focus on new FVIII and FIX concentrates, novel nonfactor therapies, and gene therapy for severe and nonsevere hemophilia A and B."

    "title": "Detection of hemophilia A genetic variants using third-generation long-read sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder caused by pathogenic variations of the factor VIII -encoding gene, F8 gene. Due to the large size and diverse types of variations in the F8 gene, causative mutations in F8 cannot be simultaneously detected in one step by traditional molecular analysis, and genetic molecular diagnosis and prenatal screening of HA still face significant difficulties and challenges in clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate an efficient, accurate, and time-saving method for the genetic detection of HA. A comprehensive analysis of hemophilia A (CAHEA) method based on long-range PCR and long-read sequencing (LRS) was used to detect F8 gene mutations in 14 clinical HA samples. The LRS results were compared with those of the conventional methods to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed approach. The CAHEA method successfully identified 14 F8 variants in all probands, including 3 small insertion deletions, 4 single nucleotide variants, and 7 intron 22 inversions in a \"one-step\" manner, of which 2 small deletions have not been reported previously. Moreover, this method provided an opportunity to analyze the mechanism of rearrangement and the pathogenicity of F8 variants. The LRS results were validated and found to be in 100% agreement with those obtained using the conventional method. Our proposed LRS-based F8 gene detection method is an accurate and reproducible genetic screening and diagnostic method with significant clinical value. It provides efficient, comprehensive, and accurate genetic screening and diagnostic services for individuals at high risk of HA as well as for premarital and prenatal populations."

    "title": "Improving Hemophilia Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Addressing Challenges and Enhancing Quality of Life.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factors, impacts millions of people worldwide. The quality of life (QoL) for those affected remains particularly suboptimal in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This article delves into the unmet needs in hemophilia care and management in LMICs, spotlighting various challenges and potential strategies for improvement. One of the primary challenges in LMICs is the limited access to comprehensive care which includes a multidisciplinary approach involving hematologists, physiotherapists, psychologists, and social workers. In many LMICs, the healthcare infrastructure is insufficient to provide such integrated services, leading to fragmented care and poorer health outcomes for individuals with hemophilia. Another significant issue is the challenge of prophylactic treatment. Prophylaxis, which involves regular infusions of clotting factor concentrates to prevent bleeding episodes, is the standard of care in high-income countries. However, in LMICs, prophylactic treatment is often not feasible due to the high cost and limited availability of clotting factor concentrates. This results in a reliance on on-demand treatment, which only addresses bleeding episodes as they occur and does not prevent the long-term complications associated with frequent bleeds. Pain management is another critical area with significant gaps. Chronic pain is a common issue for individuals with hemophilia due to repeated joint bleeds leading to joint damage. In many LMICs, access to effective pain management strategies, including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, is limited. Mental health support is also a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of hemophilia care. The chronic nature of the condition, combined with frequent hospital visits and the physical limitations imposed by the disease, can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. However, mental health services are frequently under-resourced in LMICs, and there is a lack of awareness about the mental health needs of individuals with hemophilia. Caregiver support playing a crucial role in managing the day-to-day needs of individuals with hemophilia, is another vital component of hemophilia care that is often insufficient in LMICs. Education and awareness about hemophilia are also lacking in many LMICs. There is often a limited understanding of the condition among the general public and even within the medical community, leading to misdiagnoses and delayed treatment. Employment and financial support are critical issues as well. The physical limitations and frequent medical needs associated with hemophilia can make it difficult for individuals to maintain stable employment, leading to financial strain. In many LMICs, social support systems are inadequate to address these challenges. Lastly, the integration of telehealth and digital health technologies presents a promising strategy to overcome some of these challenges providing remote access to specialist care, education, and support, which is particularly valuable in regions where healthcare resources are scarce. By adopting a multifaceted approach that involves collaboration between governments, healthcare systems, international organizations, and patient advocacy groups, it is possible to address these challenges and significantly improve the QoL for individuals with hemophilia in LMICs."

    "abstract": "We aimed to characterise baseline disease and treatment burden in a large population with haemophilia A/B, both with (HAwI/HBwI) and without (HA/HB) inhibitors. The prospective, non-interventional explorer6 study included patients ≥12 years old with severe HA, severe/moderate HB or HAwI/HBwI of any severity, treated according to local standard of care (excluding previous/current exposure to concizumab or emicizumab). Baseline characteristics and historical clinical data were collected and patient-reported outcomes, including treatment burden, were assessed. The explorer6 study enrolled 231 patients with haemophilia (84 HAwI/HBwI) from 33 countries. At baseline, patients with HA/HB treated with prophylaxis had the lowest median annualised bleeding rates (ABRs; 2.0), irrespective of haemophilia type; of these patients, 27.5% (HA) and 31.4% (HB) had target joints. Patients with HAwI/HBwI treated episodically reported the highest treatment burden. Of these patients, 28.5% (HAwI) and 25.1% (HBwI) performed sports activities in the month before screening. Despite receiving routine clinical care, historical and baseline information from patients enrolled in explorer6 showed that patients with HA/HB treated episodically and patients with HAwI/HBwI had higher ABRs, higher treatment burden and participated in sports less than those with HA/HB treated with prophylaxis. Emerging treatments could be beneficial in addressing these unmet medical needs."

    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia have a life-long risk of developing neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against clotting factor concentrates. After the first 50 exposure days (EDs), ie, in previously treated patients (PTPs), data on inhibitor development are limited. To report inhibitor development according to factor (F)VIII or FIX concentrate use in PTPs with severe hemophilia A and B. Inhibitor development in PTPs was collected since 2008 from 97 centers participating in European HAemophilia Safety Surveillance. Per concentrate, inhibitors were reported quarterly and the number of PTPs treated annually. Incidence rates (IRs)/1000 treatment years with 95% CIs were compared between concentrate types (plasma derived FVIII/FIX, standard half-life recombinant FVIII/FIX, and extended half-life recombinant (EHL-rFVIII/IX) concentrates using IR ratios with CI. Medians and IQRs were calculated for inhibitor characteristics. For severe haemophilia A, inhibitor rate was 66/65,200 treatment years, IR 1.00/1000 years (CI 0.80-1.30), occurring at median 13.5 years (2.7-31.5) and 150 EDs (80-773). IR on plasma-derived pdFVIII (IR, 1.13) and standard half-life recombinant FVIII (IR, 1.12) were similar, whereas IR on EHL-rFVIII was lower at 0.13 (incidence rate ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, <0.01-0.70; <i>P</i> < .01).For severe hemophilia B, inhibitor rate was 5/11,160 treatment years and IR was 0.45/1000 years (95% CI, 0.15-1.04), at median 3.7 years (95% CI, 2.1-42.4) and 260 EDs (95% CI, 130 to >1000). Data were insufficient to compare by type of FIX concentrates. Low inhibitor rates were observed for PTPs with severe hemophilia A and B. Data suggested reduced inhibitor development on EHL-rFVIII, but no significant difference between plasma-derived FVIII and standard half-life recombinant FVIII. FIX inhibitor rates were too low for robust statistical analysis."

    "title": "Clinical Outcomes of Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients Who Have Hemophilic Arthropathy: A Prospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered the gold standard treatment for patients who have advanced hemophilic knee arthropathy. However, special considerations are required for these patients. This prospective study reports on the need for soft-tissue procedures, implant types, complication rates, mean 53.3 months implant survivorship, and patient-reported outcome measures of TKA in hemophilic patients. There were twenty primary TKAs that were performed on 15 hemophilic patients from 2012 to 2023. The mean follow-up was 53.3 months (range, 6 to 128). The necessity for additional soft tissue procedures, implant type, complications, and revision rates were recorded. Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Knee Society Score, Hemophilia-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults, Hemophilia Activities List, and range of motion, were compared preoperatively and at the last follow-up. At the last follow-up, implant survivorship was 90%. There were 2 revisions: one for aseptic loosening and one for periprosthetic joint infection. Additional soft tissue procedures included 2 quadriceps snips (10%). Tibial augments, tibial stubby stems, and both tibial and femoral traditional stems were used in one (5%), 4 (20%), and one (5%) TKAs, respectively. A constrained posterior-stabilized bearing was necessary in one case. Clinically and statistically significant improvements were found between the preoperative and final follow-up values of all patient-reported outcome measures, knee flexion (73 versus 108 °, P < 0.001), and flexion contracture (11 versus 4 °, P = 0.002). This study showed that TKA, in patients who have hemophilic knee arthropathy, is a reliable treatment option that improves knee function and patients' quality of life with acceptable implant survival rates at midterm follow-up (mean 53.3 months). Standard implants and approaches can be used in most cases. Despite good outcomes, hemophilic patients carry additional risks for complications that require specific considerations. It is paramount for these patients to be treated in specialized centers by experienced surgeons to achieve good results."

    "abstract": "Following systemically administered adeno-associated virus gene therapy, vector particles are widely distributed, raising concerns about horizontal or germline vector transmission. Characterization of biodistribution and kinetics of vector DNA in body fluids can address these concerns and provide insights into vector behavior in accessible samples. We investigated biodistribution and vector shedding profile of valoctocogene roxaparvovec in men with severe hemophilia A enrolled in the phase 3 GENEr8-1 trial. Participants (n = 134) received a single 6 × 1013 vector genome (vg)/kg infusion and were assessed over 3 years. Vector DNA was measured using 4 different assays. Total vector DNA was evaluated in blood, saliva, stool, semen, and urine by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Encapsidated vector DNA was measured in plasma and semen with immunocapture-based qPCR. Contiguity of vgs and assembly of inverted terminal repeat fusions were measured in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using multicolor digital PCR. Median peak vector DNA levels observed 1 to 8 days after dosing were highest in blood, followed by saliva, semen, stool, and urine. Concentrations declined steadily. Encapsidated vector DNA cleared faster than total vector DNA, achieving clearance by ≤12 weeks in plasma and semen. Predominant vector genome forms transitioned from noncontiguous to full-length over time in whole blood and PBMCs, indicating formation of stable circularized episomes within nucleated cells. The replication-incompetent nature of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, coupled with steady clearance of total and encapsidated vector DNA from shedding matrices, indicates transmission risk is low. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT03370913."

Data on outcomes of efanesoctocog alfa treatment in children younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A are limited. We conducted a phase 3, open-label study involving previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received prophylaxis with once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa (50 IU per kilogram of body weight) for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the occurrence of factor VIII inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII). Secondary end points included annualized rates of treated bleeding episodes, bleeding treatment, safety, and pharmacokinetics. A total of 74 male patients were enrolled (38 with an age of <6 years and 36 with an age of 6 to <12 years). No factor VIII inhibitors developed. Most adverse events were nonserious. No serious adverse events that were assessed by the investigator as being related to efanesoctocog alfa were reported. In the 73 patients treated according to the protocol, the median and model-based mean annualized bleeding rates were 0.00 (interquartile range, 0.00 to 1.02) and 0.61 (95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.90), respectively. A total of 47 patients (64%) had no treated bleeding episodes, 65 (88%) had no spontaneous bleeding episodes, and 61 (82%) had no episodes of bleeding into joints. A total of 41 of 43 bleeding episodes (95%) resolved with one injection of efanesoctocog alfa. Mean factor VIII activity at steady state was more than 40 IU per deciliter for 3 days and more than 10 IU per deciliter for almost 7 days after dose administration. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 40.0 hours. In children with severe hemophilia A, once-weekly prophylaxis with efanesoctocog alfa provided high sustained factor VIII activity in the normal to near-normal range (>40 IU per deciliter) for 3 days and more than 10 IU per deciliter for almost 7 days after administration, leading to effective bleeding prevention. Efanesoctocog alfa was associated with mainly nonserious adverse events. (Funded by Sanofi and Sobi; XTEND-Kids ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04759131.)."

    "abstract": "In total knee arthroplasty (TKA), choosing the correct implant size is important. There is lack of data on accuracy of templating on haemophilic knees. Our aim was to test the accuracy of 2D digital templating for TKA on haemophilic arthropathy (HA) of knee. TKAs performed on HA between January 2011 and January 2022 were screened. Osteoarthritis (OA) group was created as control group by a one-to-one matching regarding type of implant used. Intra- and interobserver correlations were measured in HA, then correlation between templated and implanted sizes was investigated in four assessments (femur AP, femur lateral, tibia AP, tibia lateral), then compared with OA group. Fifty-eight knees in each group included. Regarding intraobserver correlation in HA, there was excellent correlation for femur AP [.93 (.73-.98)], femur lateral [.98 (.91-.99)], and tibia AP (1.0) templating. Regarding interobserver correlation in HA, excellent correlation was observed for femur lateral [.93 (.74-.98)] and tibia AP templating [.90 (.65-.97)]. Regarding correlation of templated and applied sizes in HA; tibia AP, tibia lateral and femur lateral templating showed good correlation [.81 (.70-.89), .86 (.77-.91), .79 (.67-.87) while femur AP templating showed moderate correlation [.67 (.50-.79)]. Comparing HA and OA, there was no difference in correlation levels regarding femur AP, femur lateral, tibia AP and tibia lateral templating (p = .056, p = .781, p = .761, p = .083, respectively). Although 2D digital templating shows comparable correlation in HA and OA, clinical applicability of templating on HA appears to be limited in its current state."

    "abstract": "Congenital Hemophilia A is a complex disease to treat, especially in places without access to hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). The primary aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of a cohort of adult people with congenital hemophilia A in an HTC localized in the Bajio region of Mexico. Observational retrospective study of a cohort of 82 adult people with congenital hemophilia A treated in a tertiary-level hospital in the Bajio region of Mexico, between June 2022 and June 2023. The median age of the patients was 29.5 years, 60.9% with severe hemophilia A, 53.6% were under some factor VIII prophylaxis regimen, and 52.4% had home therapy. The median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was one bleed/year (IQR 0-3 bleeds/year) including a median of zero joint bleeds/year (IQR 0-3 bleeds/year). The presence of high-response inhibitors was detected in 8.5%, with an overall incidence of inhibitors of 14.6% of the cohort. Univariate analysis showed that inhibitors (OR 21.10; CI 95% 1.20-370.3; <i>P</i> = 0.03) and clinical arthropathy (OR 6.14; CI 95% 2.13-17.68; <i>P</i> = 0.001) were significantly higher in severe hemophilia. Clinically significant arthropathy was found in 71.9% of patients. Ultrasonography of the target joints showed that mainly cartilage degeneration was affected. Blood transfusion-associated viral infections were detected in 10.9% of patients. In our HTC, current treatment with hemostatic agents allows adequate control of ABR with acceptable inhibitor rates. However, we still have joint damage in most patients, which is partly explained by the fact that prophylaxis was introduced only in recent years."

    "title": "A Rare Case of Hemophilia: Acquired Factor VIII Deficiency.",
    "abstract": "Unlike hereditary hemophilia, acquired hemophilia is a rare life-threatening bleeding disorder that occurs in a person who has no personal or family history of bleeding episodes. It usually presents with new-onset subcutaneous/joint/muscle bleeding causing ecchymoses and hematomas, hematuria, GI bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, or rarely acute intracranial hemorrhage in elderly individuals. The diagnosis involves assessing prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and conducting mixing studies after ruling out lupus anticoagulants and interfering substances such as heparins. Management consists of controlling hemostasis using recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC), along with eradicating autoantibodies against factor VIII from the body system using immunosuppressive therapies. Due to the risk of uncontrolled bleeding in individuals who were previously normal, delayed diagnoses and recurrences are not uncommon, potentially resulting in unfavorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "During routine treatment, plasma samples of patients with hemophilia A or acquired hemophilia A are frequently analyzed for the presence of FVIII-specific antibodies. While only inhibitory antibodies can be detected by the Bethesda assay, inhibitory and non-inhibitory antibodies can be detected by ELISA. However, plasma samples of patients frequently contain endogenous or substituted FVIII, hence interfering with both types of analyses. One option for the inactivation of FVIII is heat denaturation, which unfortunately has been shown to lead to high background signals complicating the discrimination of negative and positive plasma samples. In the current study, we developed a method of acid denaturation for FVIII-containing plasma samples that can help identify samples containing FVIII-specific antibodies and compared the effects of heat and acid denaturation on the detection of FVIII-antibody interactions in a monoclonal setting. The aim of our study was to establish an analysis that allows safer treatment decisions in the context of tolerance to FVIII."

    "abstract": "Rondaptivon pegol (previously BT200) is a pegylated RNA aptamer that binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Recent clinical trials demonstrated that BT200 significantly increased plasma VWF-factor VIII levels by attenuating VWF clearance. The biological mechanism(s) through which BT200 attenuates in vivo clearance of VWF has not been defined. We hypothesized that BT200 interaction with the VWF-A1 domain may increase plasma VWF levels by attenuating macrophage-mediated clearance. We observed that full-length and VWF-A1A2A3 binding to macrophages and VWF-A1 domain binding to lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) cluster II and cluster IV were concentration-dependently inhibited by BT200. Additionally, full-length VWF binding to LRP1 expressed on HEK293T (HEK-LRP1) cells was also inhibited by BT200. Importantly, BT200 interacts with the VWF-A1 domain in proximity to a conserved cluster of 4 lysine residues (K1405, K1406, K1407, and K1408). Alanine mutagenesis of this K1405-K1408 cluster (VWF-4A) significantly (P < .001) attenuated binding of VWF to both LRP1 clusters II and IV. Furthermore, in vivo clearance of VWF-4A was significantly (P < .001) reduced than that of wild-type VWF. BT200 did not significantly inhibit binding of VWF-4A to LRP1 cluster IV or HEK-LRP1 cells. Finally, BT200 interaction with the VWF-A1 domain also inhibited binding to macrophage galactose lectin and the SR-AI scavenger receptor. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that BT200 prolongs VWF half-life by attenuating macrophage-mediated clearance and specifically the interaction of K1405-K1408 in the VWF-A1 domain with macrophage LRP1. These data support the concept that targeted inhibition of VWF clearance pathways represents a novel therapeutic approach for von Willebrand disease and hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "Factor (F)VIII inhibitors are measured using labor- and resource-expensive Nijmegen or Bethesda assays, which lack sensitivity for low-titer inhibitors and show high variations in quality surveys, mainly because of manual assay procedures. The goal of this study was the development of a fast and fully automated FVIII inhibitor assay by using recombinant (r)FVIII as substrate and dedicated equipment for execution of the test. A new rapid, fully automated, FVIII inhibitor assay is presented, the core of which is use of full-length recombinant FVIII (rFVIII; Kovaltry, Bayer) as inhibitor substrate instead of plasma FVIII, resulting in rapid binding of inhibitors to rFVIII due to absence of von Willebrand factor. Dramatic shortening of incubation time facilitated full automation on an analyzer capable of 3 subsequent sample dilution steps and 3 reagent additions. Equal volume mixtures of sample and rFVIII (1.0 U/mL) were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C, whereafter remaining FVIII activity was analyzed with a kinetic chromogenic assay, allowing inhibitor activity calculation without preceding FVIII activity calibration, using a Ceveron s100 analyzer (Technoclone). Mean titer in 60 nonhemophiliacs was 0.0 BU/mL (SD, 0.1), yielding a limit of blank of 0.1 BU/mL and lower limit of quantification of 0.2 BU/mL. Analyses were performed with the new method and a Nijmegen assay in 28 inhibitor-positive clinical samples, 14 containing emicizumab and 14 without. Correlation coefficient in emicizumab-free type I inhibitor samples was 1.0. Emicizumab dependency of the method was excluded in spiking experiments with inhibitor-positive samples. Reproducibility was tested by analyzing 7 samples in 3 laboratories for 5 days, twice daily; coefficients of variation of all samples were <15%. We present development data of a sensitive and specific rapid, automated FVIII inhibitor assay generating results within 20 minutes that is less resource-intensive than standard assays with potential to improve assay variability."

    "abstract": "Lack of Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates is one of limiting factors for Hemophilia A prophylaxis in resource-limited countries. Rondaptivon pegol (BT200) is a pegylated aptamer and has been shown to elevate the level of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and FVIII in previous studies. A population pharmacokinetic model for BT200 was built and linked to the kinetic models of VWF and FVIII based on reasonable assumptions. The developed PK/PD model for BT200 described the observed kinetic of BT200, VWF, and FVIII in healthy volunteers and patients with mild-to-moderate hemophilia A from two clinical trials. The developed model was evaluated using an external dataset in patients with severe hemophilia A taking recombinant FVIII products. The developed and evaluated PK/PD model was able to describe and predict concentration-time profiles of BT200, VWF, and FVIII in healthy volunteers and patients with hemophilia A. Concentration-time profiles of FVIII were then predicted following coadministration of plasma-derived FVIII concentrate and BT200 under various dosing scenarios in virtual patients with severe hemophilia A. Plasma-derived products, that contain VWF, are more accessible in low-resource countries as compared to their recombinant counterparts. The predicted time above 1 and 3 IU/dL FVIII in one week was compared between scenarios in the absence and presence of BT200. A combination dose of 6 mg BT200 once weekly plus 10 IU/kg plasma-derived FVIII twice weekly maintained similar coverage to a 30 IU/kg FVIII thrice weekly dose in absence of BT200, representing only 22% of the FVIII dose per week."

Roctavian is the first licensed HA gene therapy that was conditionally approved in Europe in August 2022 and approved in the United States in June 2023. Beyond Roctavian, there are ongoing pivotal trials of additional AAV vectors for HA, others that are progressing through preclinical development or early-phase clinical trial, as well as non-AAV approaches in clinical development. This review focuses on the clinical development of Roctavian for which the collective clinical trials represent the largest body of work thus far available for any licensed AAV product. From this pioneering clinical development, several outstanding questions have emerged for which the answers will undoubtedly be important to the clinical adaptation of Roctavian and future efforts in HA gene therapy. Most notably, unexplained year-over-year declines in factor VIII (FVIII) expression after Roctavian treatment contrast with stable FVIII expression observed in other AAV HA gene therapy clinical trials with more modest initial FVIII expression. This observation has been qualitatively replicated in animal models that may permit mechanistic study. The development and approval of Roctavian is a landmark in HA therapeutics, although next-generation approaches are needed before HA gene therapy fulfills its promise of stable FVIII expression that normalizes hemostasis."

Recommendations were drafted based on four 90 min consensus meetings with expert physiotherapists. Recommendations were finalised after feedback and >80% consensus of all stakeholders (including PWH, physiotherapists, haematologists and the corresponding societies). A list of 82 recommendations was formulated to support primary care physiotherapists when treating a person with a bleeding disorder. These recommendations could be divided into 13 categories: two including recommendations on organisation of care, six on therapy for adult patients with bleeding disorders and five on therapy adaptations for paediatric care. Therapy recommendations included treatment after a joint- or muscle bleed, haemophilic arthropathy, chronic synovitis, non-haemophilia related conditions and orthopaedic surgery. An evidence-based practice guideline, based on current evidence from literature and clinical expertise, has been developed for primary care physiotherapists treating a person with haemophilia. To improve care, the recommendations should be implemented in daily practice."

    "title": "Moving towards Normalization of haemostasis and health equity: Evolving treatment goals for haemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Treatment options for people with haemophilia are evolving at a rapid pace and a range of prophylactic treatment options using various technologies are currently available, each with their own distinct safety and efficacy profile. The access to replacement therapy and prophylaxis has driven a dramatic reduction in mortality and resultant increase in life expectancy. Beyond this, the abolition of bleeds and preservation of joint health represent the expected, but rarely attained, goals of haemophilia treatment and care. These outcomes also do not address the complexity of health-related quality of life impacted by haemophilia and its treatment. Capitalizing on the major potential of therapeutic innovations, 'Normalization' of haemostasis, as a concept, should include the aspiration of enabling individuals to live as normal a life as possible, free from haemophilia-imposed limitations. To achieve this-being supported by the data reviewed in this manuscript-the concept of haemostatic and life Normalization needs to be explored and debated within the wider multidisciplinary teams and haemophilia community."

    "abstract": "A hyperactive immune response is the driving force behind severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Complications of severe COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, and increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The management of patients with COVID-19 includes respiratory support, decreasing immune response to the virus to prevent the progression of disease, and anticoagulation to prevent VTE. We present the case of a patient with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hemophilia A admitted with COVID-19. This case demonstrates the difficulties present when managing COVID-19 in patients with specific comorbidities. Anticoagulation is a recommended component of COVID-19 treatment but is contraindicated in patients with severe hemophilia due to increased risk for bleeding. Research has also shown that dexamethasone decreases mortality in patients with COVID-19, but doctors should use dexamethasone cautiously in patients with HIV since it is an immunosuppressant. Taking certain antiretroviral therapies, such as rilpivirine, also contraindicates the use of dexamethasone. In this case, it is important to monitor for the risk and presence of superimposed bacterial or opportunistic infections. Treating a patient with these comorbidities who is infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the importance of balancing the risks and benefits."

    "title": "Reduced Volume and Faster Infusion Rate of Activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrate: A Phase 3b/4 Trial in Adults with Hemophilia A with Inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b> Activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) is indicated for bleed treatment and prevention in patients with hemophilia with inhibitors. The safety and tolerability of intravenous aPCC at a reduced volume and faster infusion rates were evaluated. <b>Methods</b> This multicenter, open-label trial (NCT02764489) enrolled adults with hemophilia A with inhibitors. In part 1, patients were randomized to receive three infusions of aPCC (85 ± 15 U/kg) at 2 U/kg/min (the approved standard rate at the time of the study), in a regular or 50% reduced volume, and were then crossed over to receive three infusions in the alternative volume. In part 2, patients received three sequential infusions of aPCC in a 50% reduced volume at 4 U/kg/min and then at 10 U/kg/min. Primary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions (AHRs), infusion-site reactions (ISRs), and thromboembolic events. <b>Results</b> Of the 45 patients enrolled, 33 received aPCC in part 1 and 30 in part 2. In part 1, 24.2 and 23.3% of patients with regular and reduced volumes experienced AEs, respectively; 11 AEs in eight patients were treatment related. AHRs and ISRs occurred in four (12.1%) and two (6.1%) patients, respectively. In part 2, 3.3 and 14.3% of patients with infusion rates of 4 and 10 U/kg/min experienced AEs, respectively; only one AE in one patient was treatment related; no AHRs or ISRs were reported. Most AEs were mild/moderate in severity. Overall, no thromboembolic events were reported. <b>Conclusions</b> aPCC was well tolerated at a reduced volume and faster infusion rates, with safety profiles comparable to the approved regimen."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder. Bleeding, and in particular joint hemorrhage results in chronic arthropathy and disability. Acute and chronic pain are frequent and limit activity and participation and result in decreased health-related quality of life. Remarkable progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia but bleeding continues to prove recalcitrant to currently available treatments and joint disease remains problematic. Physiotherapy and pain management are mainstays of current multidisciplinary integrated care of people with hemophilia (PWH). The focus of this review is on preservation of joint health in the era of new and innovative therapies. A search of the PubMed Central was conducted on 1 February 2024 using the MeSH Major Topic terms identified as keywords for the manuscript. This review will highlight what is known and unknown about joint bleeding and arthropathy, including insights on pain as a related complication. Recent advances in therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting healthy joints in PWH will be discussed, including both the pharmacological treatment landscape and related strategies to promote joint health."

Since data in Southeast Asian countries remain scarce, we aim to study <i>F8</i> variation correlated with HA phenotypes in Thailand. Thai patients with HA were enrolled from seven haemophilia treatment centres during 2022-2023. Using peripheral blood DNA, inverse shifting-polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR) for <i>F8</i>-intron 22 inversion (Inv22) and <i>F8</i>-intron 1 inversion (Inv1) was performed. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was explored in cases without Inv22/Inv1. Of 124 patients with HA, 91.9% were detected with a causative <i>F8</i> variant, including Inv22 (30.6%), Inv1 (1.6%), missense (23.4%), nonsense (16.9%) and small insertion/deletion (16.1%) mutations. Inv22, small insertion/deletion and nonsense were associated with severe HA, compared with missense variants, by the ORs of 13.9 (95% CI, 4.2 to 56.7), 14.7 (95% CI, 3.4 to 104.7) and 15.6 (95% CI, 3.6 to 110.2), respectively. While nonsense variants affecting the light chain increased the risk of developing FVIII inhibitors (OR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 32.6) compared with the low-risk (small insertion/deletion, missense and splice-site) variants. Twelve patients (9.7%) harboured novel <i>F8</i> variants, comprising five missense (p.Pro540Leu, p.Ser564Pro, p.Leu668Pro, p.Ala1721Glu, p.His2024Pro), five small insertion/deletion (p.Val502SerfsTer13, p.Ile522PhefsTer13, p.Phe992LysfsTer11, p.Leu1223PhefsTer18, c.6427_6429+3delATGGTA) and one nonsense mutations (p.Glu1292Ter). IS-PCR followed by WES successfully assesses <i>F8</i> alterations in most HA cases. With several unique variants, severe HA in Thailand is considerably caused by Inv22, small insertion/deletion and nonsense, whereas missense variants are more responsible for nonsevere HA phenotypes."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) presents a significant bleeding risk. Management involves bleeding control and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) to eliminate inhibitors. This study, encompassing a retrospective cohort of 76 newly diagnosed AHA patients (1997-2022), evaluated IST outcomes such as complete remission (CR), relapse, and mortality rates, alongside influencing factors. Supplementing these findings, a systematic review and network meta-analysis compared CR and relapse rates across ISTs, sourcing from Embase, Scopus, and ScienceDirect up to November 2023. In our cohort, demarcated by a 20 Bethesda-unit titer threshold, cyclophosphamide plus prednisolone (CP; n = 64) was the predominant initial IST. Lower inhibitor levels significantly correlated with higher CR rates (86.8 % vs 62.2 %; P = .014) and showed an odds ratio of 0.26 for CR (P = .021). Median relapse-free survival (RFS) extended to 37.13 months, significantly enhanced by CP (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95 % confidence interval, 0.10-0.60; P = .002). Our network meta-analysis, including 1476 CR and 636 relapse patients, indicated CP and rituximab-based ISTs significantly outperformed steroid monotherapy in terms of CR and lower relapse rates (risk differences of 0.15 and -0.13/-0.15, respectively; P < .05), without significant differences between CP and rituximab. Moreover, adding rituximab to the front-line treatment did not produce superior outcomes compared to the CP regimen alone, positioning CP as a viable first-line choice, particularly where rituximab is less accessible. The consideration of IST toxicity remains critical in treatment decisions."

It often initially presents as serious bleeding in the absence of risk factors and carries high morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed early. Due to its rare nature, data is limited, and guidelines are primarily based on expert opinion. Here we present a case of an elderly patient with severe gastrointestinal bleeding found to have activated partial thromboplastin times, plasma mixing studies, and coagulation factor activity levels consistent with acquired hemophilia A. We hope to bring awareness of this rare disease and promote its consideration in the differential of unexpected bleeding to improve safety outcomes."

    "abstract": "This work focusses on extending the deep compartment model (DCM) framework to the estimation of mixed-effects. By introducing random effects, model predictions can be personalized based on drug measurements, enabling the testing of different treatment schedules on an individual basis. The performance of classical first-order (FO and FOCE) and machine learning based variational inference (VI) algorithms were compared in a simulation study. In VI, posterior distributions of the random variables are approximated using variational distributions whose parameters can be directly optimized. We found that variational approximations estimated using the path derivative gradient estimator version of VI were highly accurate. Models fit on the simulated data set using the FO and VI objective functions gave similar results, with accurate predictions of both the population parameters and covariate effects. Contrastingly, models fit using FOCE depicted erratic behaviour during optimization, and resulting parameter estimates were inaccurate. Finally, we compared the performance of the methods on two real-world data sets of haemophilia A patients who received standard half-life factor VIII concentrates during prophylactic and perioperative settings. Again, models fit using FO and VI depicted similar results, although some models fit using FO presented divergent results. Again, models fit using FOCE were unstable. In conclusion, we show that mixed-effects estimation using the DCM is feasible. VI performs conditional estimation, which might lead to more accurate results in more complex models compared to the FO method."

This study aimed to analyze the molecular and clinical profiles of patients with HB. A single-center study was conducted among patients with severe HB between March 20, 2000, and June 31, 2023. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used for all of the major regions, such as the promoter, the exons, the adjacent intronic regions, and the untranslated regions of the F9 gene. Finally, Sanger sequencing was performed on the PCR products. A total of 111 HB patients (17 with HB [Leyden +] and 94 with HB [Leyden -]) were enrolled in this study. Among 94 patients with HB (Leyden -), 59 (62.8 %) had missense, 21 (22.3 %) had nonsense, and 8 (8.5 %) had frameshift mutations. Moreover, the most frequent pathogenic variant in HB (Leyden +) was c.-17 A>G in this study. The results of this study confirm that HB is caused by a wide range of molecular defects in Iran. Thus, by knowing the genotypes and phenotypes, we would be able to stratify the patients which is important in terms of their management and outcome."

    "title": "[Novel treatment strategies for acquired hemophilia A].",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a bleeding disorder caused by autoantibody (inhibitor) production targeting blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). It is characterized by sudden onset, and often causes extensive and severe bleeding in soft tissue. Acquired hemophilia A is diagnosed when coagulation tests show normal PT, prolonged APTT, decreased FVIII activity, normal VWF activity, and positive FVIII inhibitor. Hemostatic therapy mainly consists of bypass therapy, which activates the extrinsic coagulation pathway, bypassing the need for FVIII or factor IX. Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that substitutes for FVIII function, can be used to prevent bleeding. Immunosuppressive therapy is necessary to suppress or eradicate inhibitors. The majority of patients go into remission with treatment, but some die from bleeding symptoms or infections associated with immunosuppressive therapy."

The objectives were to gain insights into the current and evolving treatments in hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and β-thalassemia; measure the effects of recently approved therapies on clinicians, payers, and patients; recognize emerging trends within the stop-loss market; address potential issues and obstacles related to monitoring and reporting outcomes; and identify concerns associated with both existing and emerging contracting and reimbursement models. This article aims to summarize expert perspectives on health care system challenges and strategies concerning the management of inherited blood disorders and to advance managed care professionals' understanding of their role in supporting care for these patients. The experts emphasized that when shaping coverage policies, a patient-centered approach is crucial, focusing on preserving organ function to maintain eligibility for future gene therapies among individuals with inherited blood disorders. These strategies, including benefit design modifications, specialized provider networks, and centralized mechanisms like registries, are vital for evaluating effectiveness, facilitating decision-making, and managing costs and risks associated with new and emerging treatment options for inherited blood disorders."

    "abstract": "Factor VIII and IX clotting factor concentrates manufactured from pooled plasma have been identified as potent sources of virus infection in persons with hemophilia (PWHs) in the 1970s and 1980s. To investigate the range and diversity of viruses over this period, we analysed 24 clotting factor concentrates for several blood-borne viruses. Nucleic acid was extracted from 14 commercially produced clotting factors and 10 from nonremunerated donors, preserved in lyophilized form (expiry dates: 1974-1992). Clotting factors were tested by commercial and in-house quantitative PCRs for blood-borne viruses hepatitis A, B, C and E viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV), HIV- types 1/2, parvoviruses B19V and PARV4, and human pegiviruses types 1 and 2 (HPgV-1,-2). HCV and HPgV-1 were the most frequently detected viruses (both 14/24 tested) primarily in commercial clotting factors, with frequently extremely high viral loads in the late 1970s-1985 and a diverse range of HCV genotypes. Detection frequencies sharply declined following introduction of virus inactivation. HIV-1, HBV, and HAV were less frequently detected (3/24, 1/24, and 1/24 respectively); none were positive for HEV. Contrastingly, B19V and PARV4 were detected throughout the study period, even after introduction of dry heat treatment, consistent with ongoing documented transmission to PWHs into the early 1990s. While hemophilia treatment is now largely based on recombinant factor VIII/IX in the UK and elsewhere, the comprehensive screen of historical plasma-derived clotting factors reveals extensive exposure of PWHs to blood-borne viruses throughout 1970s-early 1990s, and the epidemiological and manufacturing parameters that influenced clotting factor contamination."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disease resulting from the development of autoantibodies directed against endogenous factor (F)VIII, leading to bleeding manifestations that can be life-threatening. The current standard hemostatic treatment involves the use of bypassing agents that circumvent FVIII (recombinant activated FVII, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant porcine FVIII) that must be administered intravenously and possess a short half-life. These limitations and the risk of potentially fatal bleeding complications justify the early initiation of immunosuppressive treatment (IST) aimed at promptly eradicating the autoantibodies. IST is not without side effects, sometimes severe and possibly fatal, especially in persons with AHA who are generally older and have multiple comorbidities. Emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that mimics the action of FVIII, has emerged as an effective hemostatic therapy among persons with congenital hemophilia, whether complicated by the presence of anti-FVIII antibodies or not. Numerous arguments from recent clinical experiences suggest positioning emicizumab as a first-line treatment for AHA. This strategy has the potential to reduce bleeding complications and, importantly, the side effects associated with IST, which can be delayed and tailored to each patient."

Using haemophilia A (HA) as a use case, this analysis aimed to generate evidence for the aforementioned information using German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) claims data. Claims data (2017-2019) from the German SHI 'AOK Bayern - Die Gesundheitskasse' were used. Patients with ICD-10-GM codes D66 and HA medication were included in descriptive analyses. Severity levels were categorized according to HA medication consumption. In total, 257 patients were identified: mild HA, 104 patients (mean age: 40.0 years; SD: 22.9); moderate HA, 17 patients, (51.2 years; SD: 24.5); severe HA, 128 patients, (34.2 years; SD: 18.5). There were eight patients categorized with inhibitors (37.8 years; SD: 29.6). Psychotherapy was reported among 28.8% (mild) to 32.8% (severe) of patients. Joint disease was documented for 46.2% (mild) to 61.7% (severe) of patients. Mean direct costs per patient per year were 1.34× for mild, 11× for moderate, 81× higher for severe HA patients and 223× higher for inhibitor patients than the mean annual expenditure per AOK Bayern insurant (2019). German SHI data provide comprehensive information. The patient burden in HA is significant with respect to joint disease and psychological stress regardless of the HA severity level. The cost of HA care for patients is high. Large cost ranges suggest that the individual situation of a patient must be considered when interpreting costs. The main limitation of SHI data analysis for HA was the lack of granularity of ICD codes."

    "abstract": "The binding promiscuity of proteins defines their ability to indiscriminately bind multiple unrelated molecules. Binding promiscuity is implicated, at least in part, in the off-target reactivity, nonspecific biodistribution, immunogenicity, and/or short half-life of potentially efficacious protein drugs, thus affecting their clinical use. In this review, we discuss the current evidence for the binding promiscuity of factor VIII (FVIII), a protein used for the treatment of hemophilia A, which displays poor pharmacokinetics, and elevated immunogenicity. We summarize the different canonical and noncanonical interactions that FVIII may establish in the circulation and that could be responsible for its therapeutic liabilities. We also provide information suggesting that the FVIII light chain, and especially its C1 and C2 domains, could play an important role in the binding promiscuity. We believe that the knowledge accumulated over years of FVIII usage could be exploited for the development of strategies to predict protein binding promiscuity and therefore anticipate drug efficacy and toxicity. This would open a mutational space to reduce the binding promiscuity of emerging protein drugs while conserving their therapeutic potency."

Recently, emicizumab has been studied for its potential to reduce the need for early and aggressive IST. To compare outcomes of 2 studies that used either IST (GTH-AH 01/2010; N = 101) or prophylaxis with emicizumab (GTH-AHA-EMI; N = 47) early after diagnosis of AHA. Baseline characteristics were balanced by propensity score matching. Primary endpoint was the rate of clinically relevant new bleeds during the first 12 weeks; secondary endpoints were adverse events and overall survival. The negative binominal model-based bleeding rate was 68% lower with emicizumab as compared with IST (incident rate ratio, 0.325; 95% CI, 0.182-0.581). No difference was apparent in the overall frequency of infections (emicizumab 21%, IST 29%) during the first 12 weeks, but infections were less often fatal in emicizumab-treated patients (0%) compared with IST-treated patients (11%). Thromboembolic events occurred less often with emicizumab (2%) than with IST (7%). Overall survival after 24 weeks was better with emicizumab (90% vs 76%; hazard ratio, 0.44; 95%, CI, 0.24-0.81). Using emicizumab instead of IST in the early phase after initial diagnosis of AHA reduced bleeding and fatal infections and improved overall survival."

Long-term prophylaxis with factor (F)VIII/VWF concentrates is recommended in patients with a history of severe and frequent bleeds. A rare complication of replacement therapy is the development of alloantibodies against VWF, with the consequences of an ineffective therapy and risk of anaphylactic reactions upon treatment. Emicizumab is the first bispecific monoclonal antibody that mimics FVIII coagulant activity and is approved for prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with inherited hemophilia A with or without inhibitors and recently also for acquired hemophilia. In this manuscript we report and discuss available data in the literature on the use of emicizumab in type 3 VWD and describe the case of a female patient with type 3 VWD with a history of alloantibodies against VWF and posttransfusion anaphylaxis, recently and successfully put on off-label prophylaxis with emicizumab."

    "title": "Deletion of tissue factor pathway inhibitor isoform beta or gamma, but not alpha, improves clotting in hemophilic mice.",
    "abstract": "Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) regulates tissue factor-triggered coagulation. Humans and mice express transcripts encoding for multidistributed (endothelial, platelet, and plasma) 3-Kunitz domain TFPIα and endothelial membrane-anchored 2-Kunitz TFPIβ. Mice express a third transcript, γ, that encodes plasma lipoprotein-associated 2-Kunitz TFPI. In humans, proteolysis of α and/or β produces plasma lipoprotein-associated 2-Kunitz TFPI at lower levels. In clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies that target all TFPI isoforms extend coagulation and correct bleeding in hemophilic patients but with some thrombosis risks. To determine the impact of TFPI isoform-specific deletions on promoting clotting in hemophilic mice. Engineered TFPI isoform-specific, hemophilic (factor VIII-null) mice were evaluated for clotting. Mice expressing any single TFPI isoform were healthy. Thrombin generation assays identified TFPIγ as the dominant anticoagulation isoform in mouse plasma. Hemostasis was assessed by serial bleeding times from a tail vein laceration. Repeatedly, after a clot forms, it was manually disrupted; the number of clots/disruptions occurring over a 15-minute period were reported. C57BL/6 and hemophilic mice clot on average 25.6 vs 5.4 times, respectively. On a hemophilia background, TFPIβ or TFPIγ-specific deletion improved clotting to 14.6 and 15.2 times, respectively (P < .0001). TFPIα-specific deletion was without impact, clotting 5.1 times. Heterozygous deletion of TFPIβ was effective, clotting 11.8 times (P < .0001). Heterozygous deletion of TFPIα or TFPIγ alone was ineffective, clotting 3.0 and 6.1 times, respectively, but heterozygous TFPIαγ deletion improved clotting to 11.2 times (P < .001). In hemophilic mice, endothelial TFPIβ and plasma γ-derived 2-Kunitz TFPI individually contribute more to bleeding than total TFPIα."

    "abstract": "Regular prophylaxis with activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs) is effective in adult patients with hemophilia with inhibitors; however, data in children are scarce. This was a single-center retrospective study at Saitama Children's Medical Center. Patients with severe and moderate hemophilia with inhibitors aged <15 years at the start of aPCCs prophylaxis were included. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. We treated nine pediatric patients with hemophilia with inhibitors (median age, 1.9 years; age range, 1.3-12.9 years; inhibitor titers before treatment with aPCCs, 5.9-69 BU/mL) using prophylactic aPCCs (doses, 50-100 U/kg; 2-3 times/week). The median prophylactic period was 13 months (range: 5-31 months). The median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during prophylactic treatment with aPCCs was 2 (range, 0-17). In four patients, ABR was reduced by 19%-100% with prophylactic aPCCs compared to on-demand aPCCs. An adverse effect of treatment was that a patient with hemophilia B developed nephrotic syndrome 34 months after starting regular prophylaxis with aPCCs. Regular prophylactic aPCCs reduced the ABR even in younger children with hemophilia A and B. Serious adverse events include nephrotic syndrome, which requires caution."

Concizumab is an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) monoclonal antibody preventing factor (F)Xa inhibition and enhancing thrombin generation. Based on experience with other non-factor therapies and extended half-life products, there is a focus on potential interference with common clinical coagulation assays used to monitor patients treated with concizumab. To evaluate the impact of concizumab on standard clinical coagulation assays. Plasma samples (normal, HA/HB with/without inhibitors) in the presence/absence of added concizumab (250-16,000 ng/mL) were analysed in clinical assays including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), FVIII and FIX one-stage clot and chromogenic substrate assay, assays for detecting FVIII or FIX inhibitors and other assays for coagulation factors. Concizumab did not impact PT assays, but resulted in a small shortening of aPTT (up to 5 s in haemophilia plasma and 0.4 s in normal plasma). Concizumab had no, or only a minor impact on FVIII and FIX activity assays or Bethesda inhibitor assays. FXI and FXII activity in normal plasma, as measured by single factor aPTT-based assay, was significantly increased in the presence of concizumab (+11% each). This was also the case for FVII and FX measured by PT-based assays using plasma with 25% of FVII or FX (+64% and +22%, respectively). The presence of concizumab did not, or only slightly, influence the outcome of standard clinical coagulation assays relevant for HA and HB."

Current research emphasizes patient-reported outcomes as a vital measure for evaluating surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Nevertheless, very limited information about the subjective experience of perioperative haemophiliacs in the literature, highlighting the need for exploration in this area. To investigate the psychological experiences and health demands of haemophilic arthropathy patients during the perioperative period of total joint replacement. Qualitative descriptive research with semistructured individual interviews. From June to September 2023, nine patients with severe haemophilic arthropathy who underwent total joint replacement at a Haemophilia Diagnosis and Treatment Centre in China were interviewed for average 37 min per person. Data were analysed using the traditional content analysis method and reported following the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research. The study is reported according to the COREQ checklist. Interviews described two main themes: (1) emotional decline which involves preoperative overoptimism, early postoperative anxiety and disease uncertainty during the early independent rehabilitation. (2) wellness aspiration which includes rehabilitation support and spiritual healing. This study reveals the patients' significant psychological changes and their well-being aspiration, particularly out-of-hospital rehabilitation needs. Strengthening communication between multidisciplinary teams and patients, enhancing the involvement of nurses, broadening the scope of functions at primary Haemophilia Treatment Centres, and developing telerehabilitation, these concerted efforts may improve the overall treatment experience for patients."

    "title": "Genetics and Epigenetics in Acquired Hemophilia A: From Bench to Bedside.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a bleeding disorder characterized by the immunological inhibition of factor VIII (FVIII) of the hemostatic pathway leading to hemorrhagic events. Different domains of FVIII are the target of autoantibodies (mainly immunoglobulin (Ig) G) leading to the deficiency of FVIII. Several factors have been associated with the activation of the auto-immunity towards FVIII. Emerging evidence implicates CD4+ T cell activation in mediating this autoimmune response, with their involvement like that observed in congenital hemophilia A. Several genes such as HLA II DRB*16, DQB1*0502, and CTLA-4 + 49 are responsible for the pathogenesis of AHA. Epigenetic modifications and mainly long-coding RNAS (lncRNAs) are potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of AHA. The treatment approach of AHA includes the management of acute bleeding events and the administration of immunosuppressive medications. This review aimed to summarize the published data on the genetics and epigenetics of AHA. The severity and the mortality of this disease are creating an emerging need for further research in the field of the genetics and epigenetics of acquired hemorrhagic disorder."

    "abstract": "Emicizumab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that mimics the function of factor VIII by binding to factor IXa and factor X to achieve haemostasis in haemophilia A. The long half-life and subcutaneous mode of administration makes emicizumab a compelling treatment option for bleeding prophylaxis. There is still limited real-world data on its use and management considerations, especially during surgical procedures. The objective of the study is to describe the real-world experience of emicizumab in a cohort of adult and paediatric haemophilia A patients in Singapore, including its use in the periprocedural setting. This was an observational study conducted at the 2 main haemophilia treatment centres in Singapore. All haemophilia A patients who commenced treatment with emicizumab before 1 July 2022 were recruited. A total of 18 patients with haemophilia A were included in this study. Ten (55.6%) patients had active inhibitors. The median annual bleeding rate for all patients before emicizumab use was 4.5 events (interquartile range [IQR] 2.8-8.3) compared with 0 events (IQR 0-0) after emicizumab was commenced (P=0). There were no adverse events of venous or arterial thrombosis, thrombotic microangiopathy, or death. A total of 6 procedures in 5 patients were performed during the study period with no major bleeding complications. Emicizumab effectively protects against bleeding in haemophilia A patients with and without inhibitors, including in children less than 12 years old. More studies are required to address clinical nuances, such as periprocedural management and the role of immune tolerance in patients with inhibitors on emicizumab."

We demonstrate that full-length HITI donor DNA is preferentially integrated upon nuclease cleavage and that, despite partial AAV genome integrations in the target locus, no gross chromosomal rearrangements or insertions/deletions at off-target sites are found. In line with this, no evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is observed within the 1-year follow-up. Finally, AAV-HITI is effective at vector doses considered safe if directly translated to humans providing therapeutic efficacy in the adult liver in addition to newborn. Overall, our data support the development of this liver-directed AAV-based knockin strategy."

The primary outcomes included the description of PA by type and intensity, adherence to World Health Organization guidelines, bleeding, and health-related quality of life by EQ-5D questionnaire. PA data were collected continuously through a fitness tracker worn by the patient; all the other variables were collected through ePRO questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> Only 54 of the 103 enrolled subjects (52.4%) used their fitness tracker for the defined valid period; adolescents were the least compliant age group. PA was performed at low rates and intensity. Approximately 52% of the subjects had sedentary behavior. The mean EQ-5D values did not change over time. At least one bleeding was reported in 43.7% of the subjects, mostly with sedentary behavior. The PA in the 2 days preceding the bleeding was comparable to the one observed in the overall observational period. <b>Conclusions:</b> The systematic recording of data through a fitness tracker and ePRO app shows that subjects with HA without inhibitors have lower-than-expected PA and that they still experience issues related to bleeding."

This study aimed to understand patient perspectives on GT for HA and HB in Italy using a qualitative questionnaire distributed through Italian patient associations, addressing patient views on daily life, treatments, unmet needs, quality of life (QoL), and GT for hemophilia. In total, 141 participants had HA, and 14 had HB (severe 78.6%). Daily life was most affected by pain and/or joint function limitations (57.5% of participants), high infusion frequency (42.5%), management of breakthrough bleeding episodes (40.3%), and anxiety/fear of severe or sudden bleeding (38.8%). Despite current treatments, about half of the participants experienced three or more annual bleeding episodes. Most participants knew of GT (87.2%) and expected improvements in QoL (60.5%), reduced frequency of current treatments (53.5%), and a permanent cure (49.1%); 46.4% were unaware of its once-off dosage and 46.4% were not concerned about the costs they anticipated to be associated with GT. Although several fears were reported, 25.0% of participants were willing to undergo GT with the support of a multidisciplinary team. This survey provided valuable insight into patient perspectives on hemophilia and GT in Italy. Overall, relevant proportions of patients still experience limitations affecting their daily life.

We detailed the surgical process, including patient demographics and intraoperative imaging use. The choice of the RJV for TIVAP placement was influenced by its larger diameter and superficial anatomical position, potentially reducing risks like thrombosis and infection. Our findings support the RJV as a safer alternative for port placement in pediatric patients, aligning with current literature. Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between complications and baseline characteristics like weight and diagnosis type. However, the length of hospital stay and implant brand were significant risk factors for catheter or port displacement and removal. The limited patient number may introduce bias, suggesting a need for further studies with larger samples. Despite a 14.7 %-33 % complication rate and 5 port removals, the advantages of TIVAP, including reliable venous access, reduced discomfort, and treatment convenience, were evident. Most complications improved with symptomatic treatment, and there were no deaths due to port-related complications, underscoring the impact of TIVAP on improving pediatric hemophilia treatment."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for hemophilia is a groundbreaking treatment approach with promising results and potential to reduce the burden of the disease. However, uncertainties remain, particularly regarding the liver side effects of AAV gene therapy, which are more common in hemophilia A. Unlike some other diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy, where the target cell for gene therapy is different from the one affected by side effects, hemophilia gene therapy operates within the same cellular domain-the hepatocyte. This overlap is challenging and requires a targeted strategy to mitigate the risks associated with liver injury, which often requires temporary immunosuppressive therapy. A comprehensive approach is essential to increase the efficacy of gene therapy and reduce the likelihood of hepatocyte damage. Key components of this strategy include a thorough pre-gene therapy assessment of liver health, careful post-gene therapy liver monitoring, and prompt therapeutic intervention for loss of transgene expression and liver injury. Collaboration between hematologists and hepatologists is essential to ensure a well-coordinated management plan for patients undergoing hemophilia gene therapy. This review addresses the critical aspect of hepatic comorbidities in patients with hemophilia, emphasizing the need to identify and address these issues prior to initiating gene therapy. It examines the known mechanisms of liver damage and emphasizes the importance of liver monitoring after gene therapy. In addition, the review draws insights from experiences with other AAV-based gene therapies, providing valuable lessons that can guide hemophilia centers in effectively managing liver damage associated with hemophilia gene therapy."

The heterozygote male and female were crossed to get homozygote, heterozygote, and wild-type fish. Functional kinetic coagulation assays and bleeding assays were performed on normal and mutant adult fish, and venous laser injury assays were performed on the larvae. The DNA from fviii and fv mutants were sequenced to confirm if they have a premature stop codon in exon 19, and in exon 2, respectively, and in both mutants, the amino acid glutamine is replaced with a stop codon. Homozygous and heterozygous 5 days post fertilization (dpf) larvae for fviii and fv deficient mutants exhibited prolonged time to occlusion after venous laser injury compared to wild-type controls. The homozygous and heterozygous fviii adult mutants showed modest bleeding and delayed fibrin formation in the kinetic partial thromboplastin time (kPTT) assay with their plasma. fv homozygous larvae had poor survival beyond 12 dpf. However, heterozygous fv mutants exhibited heavy bleeding and prolonged fibrin formation in the kPTT and kPT assay compared with wild-type siblings. Our characterization showed fviii and fv mutants from ZIRC phenocopied to a considerable extent classical hemophilia A and factor V deficiency in humans, respectively. These models should be useful in studying and developing novel drugs that reverse the phenotype and in generating suppressor mutations to identify novel factors that compensate for these deficiencies."

Both genetic and environmental elements influencing the immune response toward FVIII have been identified but still not all the factors causing the pathological rejection of FVIII have been identified. Since there is a connection between coagulation and inflammation, here we assessed the role played by the FVIII deficiency in shaping the humoral and cellular response toward an antigen other than FVIII itself. To this aim, we challenged both HA and wild-type (WT) mice with either FVIII or ovalbumin (OVA) and followed antigen-specific antibody level, immune cell population frequency and phenotype up to 9 weeks after the last antigen booster. The activation threshold was evaluated in vitro by stimulating the murine T cells with a decreasing dose of α-CD3. The humoral response to FVIII was similar between the two groups while both the in vivo and in vitro experiments highlighted an antigen-independent sensitivity of HA compared with WT T cells causing an increase in memory T-cell conversion and proliferation capability."

To assess the association between endogenous factor level and bleeding phenotype in children with nonsevere (factor [F]VIII/FIX activity 1%-25%) hemophilia A (HA) and B without prophylaxis. Data on annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized joint bleeding rate (AJBR), and onset of bleeding were extracted from the international PedNet cohort including children born since 2000.

    "abstract": "For several decades, therapeutic options for inherited deficiencies of factor VIII or IX (hemophilia A or B, respectively) have largely been the replacement of the missing clotting factor with plasma-derived or recombinant products. Hemostasis laboratories use standard activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based clotting or chromogenic assays to monitor plasma factor levels to guide therapy. The emergence in the past 10 years of extended half-life replacement products and other novel therapies for hemophilia has led to a reappraisal of assay suitability, with studies of product measurement showing some existing assay types or reagents to be unsuitable for some products. The hemostasis laboratory must adapt to the changing landscape by adding new assays or modifying existing assays to ensure accurate results for product measurement. These strategies include switching from a chromogenic assay to a clotting assay, or vice versa, changing an aPTT reagent brand, or introducing product specific calibrators. This article evaluates the effects of some of the newer treatment options on the laboratory testing of factor levels and related assays."

In the present study, we administered an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) 5 vector carrying an short hairpin (sh)RNA to Neat1 via intra-articular injection alone or in conjunction with systemic administration of a capsid-modified AAV8 (K31Q) vector carrying F8 gene (F8-BDD-V3) to study its impact on HA. AAV8K31Q-F8 vector administration at low dose, led to an increase in FVIII activity (16%-28%) in treated mice. We further observed a significant knockdown of Neat1 (~40 fold vs. untreated injured joint, p = 0.005) in joint tissue of treated mice and a downregulation of chondrodegenerative enzymes, MMP3, MMP13 and the inflammatory mediator- cPLA2, in mice receiving combination therapy. These data demonstrate that AAV mediated Neat1 knockdown in combination with F8 gene augmentation can potentially impact mediators of haemophilic joint disease."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia can detrimentally affect patients' quality of life and likelihood of survival. In the evolving landscape of therapies, the therapeutic gain of each treatment must be understood to accurately position it in the therapeutic armamentarium. Accordingly, appropriate outcomes must be measured with appropriate tools. Our narrative review (PubMed search for 'hemophilia AND outcome' until June 2023), provides a compendium of outcome measures used in hemophilia clinical research. To define each outcome measure's relative value and applicability, several characteristics are critically discussed. Bleeding assessment, first annual/annualized bleeding rate, remains central in evaluating the efficacy and safety of hemophilia treatments. As modern therapies improve clinical outcomes toward zero bleeding events, this endpoint may become less sensitive to detect differences between therapeutic approaches. Technological advancements necessitate the adaptation of outcome measures to address infrequent bleeding events, age-related comorbidities, and laboratory parameters with limited comparability after different treatments. Considerable effort has been dedicated to the development of tools that comprehensively assess coagulation, such as thrombin generation assays. Patient-reported outcome measures are gaining importance although limited by their subjectivity. A definitive set of research outcome measures remains elusive. Outcomes may need to be tailored to different therapeutic interventions."

    "title": "Inflammatory diseases causing joint and bone destruction: rheumatoid arthritis and hemophilic arthropathy.",
    "abstract": "Various diseases and conditions cause joint disorders. Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage, synovitis, and anabolic changes in surrounding bone tissues. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hemophilic arthropathy (HA) display marked destruction of bone tissues caused by synovitis. RA is a representative autoimmune disease. The primary tissue of RA pathogenesis is the synovial membrane and involves various immune cells that produce catabolic cytokines and enzymes. Hemophilia is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in blood clotting factors. Recurrent intra-articular bleeding leads to chronic synovitis through excessive iron deposition and results in the destruction of affected joints. Although the triggers for these two joint diseases are completely different, many cytokines and enzymes are common in the pathogenesis of both RA and HA. This review focuses on the similarities between joint and bone destruction in RA and HA. The insights may be useful in developing better treatments for hemophilia patients with arthropathy and osteoporosis by leveraging advanced therapeutics for RA."

    "title": "Asymptomatic COVID-19-Associated Acquired Hemophilia A and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation From a Bypassing Agent.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a clotting disorder characterized by the presence of neutralizing antibodies that inhibit factor VIII, resulting in increased bleeding risk. Known etiologies include malignancy, autoimmune conditions, graft-vs-host disease, and more recently coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. In this case report, we describe an 86-year-old female who was found to have AHA incidentally during preoperative workup for meningioma resection. She was subsequently found to have COVID-19 infection which was the likely cause of her development of AHA. She was treated with factor eight inhibitor bypassing agent (FEIBA) and recombinant factor VII (rVII) for a small hematoma on her right arm along with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. She then developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initially secondary to FEIBA and subsequently rFVII. DIC resolved after these factor concentrates were withheld. The aim of this case report was to emphasize the importance of monitoring partial thromboplastin time (PTT) in patients with COVID-19 and proceeding with AHA workup if indicated. It is also imperative to know and understand the potentially life-threatening, albeit rare, adverse effects of DIC associated with the administration of factor concentrates, especially in the elderly population and withholding these factor concentrates once DIC is suspected."

    "abstract": "Reduced doses of emicizumab improve the affordability among patients in developing countries. However, the relationship between variant dose selection and efficacy in the real world of China is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of emicizumab especially in those on reduced dose regimens in a real-world setting. We carried out a multicentre study from 28 hospitals between June 2019 and June 2023 in China and retrospectively analysed the characteristics including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, bleeding episodes, and surgical procedures. In total, 127 patients with haemophilia A, including 42 with inhibitors, were followed for a median duration of 16.0 (IQR: 9.0-30.0) months. Median age at emicizumab initiation was 2.0 (IQR: 1.0-4.0) years. Median (IQR) consumption for loading and maintenance was 12.0 (8.0-12.0) and 4.2 (3.0-6.0) mg/kg/4 weeks, respectively. While on emicizumab, 67 (52.8%) patients had no bleeds, whereas 60 (47.2%) patients had any bleeds, including 26 with treated bleeds. Compared to previous treatments, patients on emicizumab had significantly decreased annualized bleeding rate, annualized joint bleeding rate, target joints and intracerebral haemorrhage. Different dosages had similar efficacy except the proportion of patients with treated spontaneous bleeds and target joints. Adverse events were reported in 12 (9.4%) patients. Postoperative excessive bleeding occurred following two of nine procedures. This is the largest study describing patients with HA receiving emicizumab prophylaxis on variant dose regimens in China. We confirmed that nonstandard dose is efficacious and can be considered where full-dose emicizumab is ill affordable."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A arises from dysfunctional or deficient coagulation factor (F)VIII and leads to inefficient fibrin clot formation and uncontrolled bleeding events. The development of antibody inhibitors is a clinical complication in hemophilia A patients receiving FVIII replacement therapy. LE2E9 is an anti-C1 domain inhibitor previously isolated from a mild/moderate hemophilia A patient and disrupts FVIII interactions with von Willebrand factor and FIXa, though the intermolecular contacts that underpin LE2E9-mediated FVIII neutralization are undefined. To determine the structure of the complex between FVIII and LE2E9 and characterize its mechanism of inhibition. FVIII was bound to the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of NB2E9, a recombinant construct of LE2E9, and its structure was determined by cryogenic electron microscopy. This report communicates the 3.46 Å structure of FVIII bound to NB2E9, with its epitope comprising FVIII residues S2040 to Y2043, K2065 to W2070, and R2150 to H2155. Structural analysis reveals that the LE2E9 epitope overlaps with portions of the epitope for 2A9, a murine-derived inhibitor, suggesting that these residues represent a shared antigenic region on the C1 domain between FVIII<sup>-/-</sup> mice and hemophilia A patients. Furthermore, the FVIII:NB2E9 structure elucidates the orientation of the LE2E9 glycan, illustrating how the glycan sterically blocks interactions between the FVIII C1 domain and the von Willebrand factor D' domain. A putative model of the FVIIIa:FIXa complex suggests potential clashing between the NB2E9 glycan and FIXa light chain. These results describe an antigenic \"hotspot\" on the FVIII C1 domain and provide a structural basis for engineering FVIII replacement therapeutics with reduced antigenicity."

    "abstract": "Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the emergence of inhibitors that specifically target coagulation Factor VIII, frequently resulting in severe bleeding episodes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of a 68-year-old male patient who presented with adalimumab-induced AHA. The patient received adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor antibody, as part of his treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's clinical journey, characterized by intense bleeding and coagulopathy, was effectively managed with the application of recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and the CyDRi protocol. The case emphasizes the importance of prompt coagulation assessment in patients with bleeding symptoms receiving disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis that includes adalimumab therapy, considering the rare yet life-threatening nature of AHA. Additionally, this report provides an extensive review of the existing literature on drug-induced AHA, with a special emphasis on cases linked to immunomodulatory medications. Through this two-pronged approach, our report aims to enhance understanding and awareness of this severe complication among healthcare providers, promoting timely diagnosis and intervention."

(1) To determine the effects of resistance training on muscle strength in adults with haemophilia; (2) To determine the most effective duration and modality among the exercise protocols. A systematic search from inception until 28 November 2023 was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases. We included randomised controlled trials or before-after studies that involved resistance training without other physiotherapy co-interventions. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were independently performed by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with a third author. The level of evidence was determined according to the GRADE methodology. Seven studies were included. Measurements of knee extensor strength and elbow extensor strength were included in the meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis showed significant effects for both elastic resistance protocols (SMD: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.02-1.07) and conventional training (isometric and weight-based equipment) (SMD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.50-1.25), demonstrating small and moderate effect sizes respectively. Additionally, both protocols of duration 5-7 weeks (SMD: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.63-1.69) as well as those of duration ≥8 weeks (SMD: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.20-0.94) showed a significant difference. Resistance training is effective in improving muscle strength of the knee and elbow extensors in PWH. Both elastic resistance and conventional training show benefits."

    "title": "Optimizing liver health before and after gene therapy for hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy for severe hemophilia A uses an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector and liver-specific promoters that depend on healthy hepatocyte function to achieve safe and long-lasting increases in factor VIII (FVIII) activity. Thus, hepatocyte health is an essential aspect of safe and successful gene therapy. Many people living with hemophilia A have current or past chronic hepatitis C virus infection, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatosis or steatohepatitis, or other conditions that may compromise the efficacy and safety of AAV-mediated gene therapy. In addition, gene therapy may induce an immune response to transduced hepatocytes, leading to liver inflammation and reduced FVIII activity. The immune response can be treated with immunosuppression, but close monitoring of liver function tests and factor levels is necessary. The long-term risk of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with gene therapy is unknown. Routine screening by imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma, preferable every 6 months, is essential in patients at high risk and recommended in all recipients of hemophilia A gene therapy. This paper describes our current understanding of the biologic underpinnings of how liver health affects hemophilia A gene therapy, and provides practical clinical guidance for assessing, monitoring, and managing liver health both before and after gene therapy."

However, it is not successful in 10% to 40% of the cases. The biological mechanisms and biomarkers associated with ITI outcome are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of plasma cytokines (interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A), chemokines (IL-8/CXCL8, RANTES/CCL5, MIG/CXCL9, MCP-1/CCL2, and IP-10/CXCL10), and anti-FVIII immunoglobulin (Ig) G total, IgG1, and IgG4 with ITI outcome. In this cross-sectional analysis of the Brazilian Immune Tolerance Study, we assessed plasma levels of anti-FVIII IgGs using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with plasma-derived FVIII and recombinant FVIII as target antigens, immobilized in microplates. We assayed 98 plasma samples of moderately severe and severe (FVIII activity, <2%) people with hemophilia A after completion of a first ITI course. Levels of anti-recombinant FVIII IgG total and IgG4 were higher in people with hemophilia A who failed ITI (IgG total optical density [OD], 0.37; IQR, 0.15-0.73; IgG4 OD, 2.19; IQR, 0.80-2.52) than in those who had partial (IgG total OD, 0.03; IQR, 0.00-0.14; IgG4 OD, 0.39; IQR, 0.09-1.11; <i>P</i> < .0001 for both) or complete success (IgG total OD, 0.04; IQR, 0.00-0.07; IgG4 OD, 0.07; IQR, 0.06-0.40; <i>P</i> < .0001 for both). Plasma cytokines, chemokines, and anti-FVIII IgG1 were not associated with ITI outcome. Our results show that high levels of plasma anti-FVIII IgG4 and IgG total are associated with ITI failure."

(1) To evaluate the feasibility of different clinical motor performance tests associated with the risk of falling in PwH; (2) to evaluate PwH's performance of these tests compared to a control group; (3) to identify possible influencing factors that affect performance. Twenty-nine severe and moderate PwH (57.0 years, IQR: 48.0-61.5) and 29 healthy age- and BMI-matched control participants (CG) performed 13 different clinical tests (SPPB, timed up and go, push and release, functional reach, single-leg stance, knee and grip strength). Haemophilia joint health score (HJHS), kinesiophobia (TSK-11), subjective physical performance (HEP-Test-Q), falls efficiency (FES-I) and falls were assessed. No adverse events occurred. PwH showed impaired performance in all clinical tests, a lower falls efficiency and a higher HJHS than CG. PwH with higher HJHS, lower HEP-Test-Q and higher TSK-11 scores showed higher deficits. Largest discrepancies were observed in the single-leg stance with eyes open and knee extensor strength, where orthopaedically majorly affected PwH showed worse performance compared to minorly affected PwH and the CG, respectively. The prevalence of ≥1 fall in the last year was 27.6% (PwH) and 10.3% (CG). These clinical tests are feasible in PwH. Impaired joint status, a high kinesiophobia and low physical performance impair performance. These tests can be used by clinicians for gaining specific information on functional motor abilities of patients."

A 17-year-old man with hemophilia had a posterior dislocation of the SCJ and the proximal clavicle was an approximation to the brachiocephalic artery. Cardiovascular surgeons and pediatricians were consulted on the day of injury. The patient underwent open reduction of the SCJ and the SCJ was stabilized with strong sutures using a tension-band technique. The patient returned to playing rugby three months after surgery. Posterior dislocation of the SCJ has a risk of vascular injury. Although our patient required more attention because of his hemophilia, the surgery was successful through collaboration with other departments. Reconstruction of the SCJ using a tension-band technique with strong sutures was useful and allowed early return to sports."

Currently, four (semi-)automated TGA platforms are available: the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram, Nijmegen Hemostasis Assay, ST Genesia and Ceveron s100. In this study, we compared their performance for detecting patients with congenital single coagulation factor deficiencies. Pooled patient samples, healthy control samples and normal pooled plasma were tested on all four platforms, using the available reagents that vary in tissue factor and phospholipid concentrations. The TGA parameters selected for analysis were peak height and thrombin potential. Results were normalized by using the calculated mean of healthy controls and a correction for between-run variation. Outcomes were presented as relative values, with the mean of healthy controls standardized to 100 %. Across all platforms and reagents used, thrombin potentials and peak heights of samples with coagulation factor deficiencies were lower than those of healthy controls. Reagents designed for bleeding tendencies yielded the lowest values on all platforms (relative median peak height 19-32 %, relative median thrombin potential 19-45 %). Samples representing more severe coagulation factor deficiencies generally exhibited lower relative peak heights and thrombin potentials. Thrombin generation assays prove effective in differentiating single coagulation factor deficient samples from healthy controls, with modest discrepancies observed between the platforms. Reagents designed for assessing bleeding tendencies, featuring the lowest tissue factor and phospholipid concentrations, emerged as the most suitable option for detecting coagulation factor deficiencies."

    "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) effectively treats end-stage hemophilic hip arthropathy. Given hemophilia's unique characteristics, perioperative bleeding remains a significant risk for patients undergoing THA. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an efficient antifibrinolytic agent, may benefit the outcomes of THA for patients with hemophilia (PWH). This study aims to explore the clinical efficacy of intra-articular injection of TXA in treating perioperative bleeding in PWH and assess its additional clinical benefits. The retrospective study comprised data of PWH who received THA from January 2015 to December 2021 in the research center. A total of 59 individuals were included in the study, divided into a TXA group (n = 31) and a non-TXA group (n = 28). We compared various parameters, including total blood loss (TBL), visible blood loss (VBL), occult blood loss (OBL), intraoperative coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) consumption, perioperative total FVIII consumption, hemoglobin (HB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), length of hospital stay, hospitalization costs, length of surgery, total protein, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), D-dimer, rate of joint swelling, hip joint range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS), and Harris hip joint function scale (HHS) between the two groups. Follow-up assessments were conducted for up to 24 months. A Student's t test was utilized for the statistical analysis. This study demonstrated that intra-articular TXA effectively reduced TBL (1248.19 ± 439.88 mL, p < 0.001), VBL (490.32 ± 344.34 mL, p = 0.003), and OBL (757.87 ± 381.48 mL, p = 0.004) in PWH who underwent THA. TXA demonstrated effectiveness in reducing VAS scores on POD1, POD7, and POD14 and joint swelling rates on POD1, POD7, POD14, and at discharge (p < 0.05). Additionally, the TXA group achieved higher HHS ratings at all follow-up time points (p < 0.05), showing superior hip joint mobility, lower postoperative inflammation levels, reduced factor VIII consumption during surgery, and less postoperative nutritional loss. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of hospital stay, hospitalization costs, surgery duration, and coagulation indicators. Intra-articular injection of TXA reduces perioperative bleeding in PWH undergoing THA while also improving joint mobility, post-operative rehabilitation, and quality of life. This may provide value for the future application of TXA in PWH."

    "abstract": "Durable factor VIII (FVIII) expression that normalizes hemostasis is an unrealized goal of hemophilia A adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy. Trials with initial normal FVIII activity observed unexplained year-over-year declines in expression while others reported low-level, stable FVIII expression inadequate to restore normal hemostasis. Here we demonstrate that mice recapitulate FVIII expression-level-dependent loss of plasma FVIII levels due to declines in vector copy number. We show that an enhanced function FVIII variant (FVIII-R336Q/R562Q; FVIII-QQ), resistant to inactivation by protein C, normalizes hemostasis at below-normal expression levels without evidence of prothrombotic risk in hemophilia A mice. These data support that FVIII-QQ may restore normal FVIII function at low-levels of expression to permit durability using low AAV vector doses to minimize dose-dependent AAV toxicities. This work informs the mechanism of FVIII durability after AAV gene transfer and supports that incorporating the FVIII-QQ transgene may safely overcome current hemophilia A gene therapy limitations."

Subsequently, the patients performed US unsupervised at home three times a week for a total of 6 weeks with a reteaching after 2 weeks. All images were checked for mapping of the landmarks defined in the HEAD-US protocol by a radiologist. In a final test after the completion of the self-sonography period, participants were asked to identify scanning plane and potential pathology from US images of other PwH. On the images of the self-performed scans, 82.7% of the possible anatomic landmarks could be identified and 67.5% of the requested images were unobjectionable, depicting 100% of the required landmarks. There was a highly significant improvement in image quality following reteaching after 2 weeks (74.80 ± 36.88% vs. 88.31 ± 19.87%, p < .001). In the final test, the participants identified the right scanning plane in 85.0% and they correctly identified pathology in 90.0% of images. Appropriately trained PwH can perform the HEAD-US protocol of their knee with high quality and are capable to identify pathologic findings on these standardized images.

This retrospective observational study included patients with haemophilia A or B, von Willebrand disease, Glanzmann thrombasthenia or isolated coagulation factor deficiency such as afibrinogenemia who underwent osseous (third molar extraction, ortho-surgical traction, dental implant placement) or nonosseous oral surgery between 2014 and 2021 at Bordeaux University Hospital (France). Patients and oral surgery characteristics were retrieved from medical records. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Of the 83 patients included, general anaesthesia was performed in 16%. Twelve had a bleeding complication (14.5%) including six after osseous surgery. The most serious complication was the appearance of anti-FVIII inhibitor in a patient with moderate haemophilia A. All bleeding complications were managed by a local treatment and factor injections where indicated. No association was observed between type of surgery (osseous vs. nonosseous) and risk of bleeding complications after controlling for sex, age, disease type and severity, multiple extractions, type of anaesthesia and use of fibrin glue (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: .69-14.88). In this study, we have observed that bleeding complications after oral surgery in people with inherited bleeding disorders were moderately frequent and easily managed.

    "abstract": "Hemophilic arthropathy (HA) is a condition caused by recurrent intra-articular bleeding in patients with hemophilia. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HA. Our previous research demonstrated that a novel compound, piperazino-enaminone (JODI), effectively inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β, in a mouse model of hemarthrosis. This study aims to enhance the anti-inflammatory effect of JODI by employing nanoparticle delivery systems, which could potentially improve its poor water solubility. Here, we developed liposomes modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for the delivery of JODI (JODI-LIP), and found that JODI-LIP exhibited uniform size, morphology, good stability and in vitro release degree. JODI-LIP mitigated cytotoxicity of JODI, and significantly suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and nitric oxide (NO) release in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as the proliferation of human fibroblast-like synovial (HFLS) cells. In a murine model of HA, JODI-LIP demonstrated superior efficacy in ameliorating joint swelling and synovitis, compared to JODI. Importantly, JODI-LIP markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-33, and MCP-1) in injured joints. No hepatic or hematological toxicity was observed in mice treated with JODI-LIP. In summary, our results suggest that JODI-LIP holds promise as a therapeutic intervention for HA by attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels."

    "abstract": "A2 domain dissociation in activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) results in reduced activity. Previous studies demonstrated that some FVIII mutants (D519V/E665V and K1813A) with delayed A2 dissociation enhanced coagulation potential. We speculated, therefore, that FVIII encompassing a combination of these mutations might further enhance coagulant activity. The aim was to assess the D519V/E665V/K1813A-FVIII mutation as a gain of function. The FVIII mutants, D519V/E665V/K1813A, D519V/E665V, and K1813A were expressed in a baby hamster kidney cell system, and global coagulation potential of these mutants was compared with wild-type (WT) FVIII in vitro and in hemophilia A mice in vivo. Kinetic analyses indicated that the apparent Kd for FIXa on the tenase assembly with D519V/E665V and D519V/E665V/K1813A mutants were lower, and that the generated FXa for D519V/E665V/K1813A was significantly greater than WT-FVIII. WT-FVIII activity after thrombin activation increased by ∼12-fold within 5 minutes, and returned to initial levels within 30 minutes. In contrast, The FVIII-related activity of D519V/E665V/K1813A increased further with time after thrombin activation, and showed an ∼25-fold increase at 2 hours. The A2 dissociation rate of D519V/E665V/K1813A was ∼50-fold slower than the WT in a 1-stage clotting assay. Thrombin generation assays demonstrated that D519V/E665V/K1813A (0.125 nM) exhibited coagulation potential comparable with that of the WT (1 nM). In animal studies, rotational thromboelastometry and tail-clip assays showed that the coagulation potential of D519V/E665V/K1813A (0.25 μg/kg) was equal to that of the WT (2 μg/kg). FVIII-D519V/E665V/K1813A mutant could provide an approximately eightfold increase in hemostatic function of WT-FVIII because of increased FVIIIa stability and the association between FVIIIa and FIXa."

    "title": "Aberrant methylation and expression of TNXB promote chondrocyte apoptosis and extracullar matrix degradation in hemophilic arthropathy via AKT signaling.",
    "abstract": "Recurrent joint bleeding in hemophilia patients frequently causes hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Drastic degradation of cartilage is a major characteristic of HA, but its pathological mechanisms has not yet been clarified. In HA cartilages, we found server matrix degradation and increased expression of DNA methyltransferase proteins. We thus performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on human HA (N=5) and osteoarthritis (OA) (N=5) articular cartilages, and identified 1228 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the association between DMR genes (DMGs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. Among these DMGs, Tenascin XB (TNXB) expression was down-regulated in human and mouse HA cartilages. The loss of <i>Tnxb</i> in <i>F8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse cartilage provided a disease-promoting role in HA by augmenting cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss. <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown also promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT. Importantly, AKT agonist showed chondroprotective effects following <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown. Together, our findings indicate that exposure of cartilage to blood leads to alterations in DNA methylation, which is functionally related to ECM homeostasis, and further demonstrate a critical role of TNXB in HA cartilage degeneration by activating AKT signaling. These mechanistic insights allow development of potentially new strategies for HA cartilage protection."

    "title": "Walking ability in adults with severe hemophilia: A cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "A lack of factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) results in hemophilia, a blood-clotting illness. The mode of inheritance is chromosome X-linked and recessive. The primary symptom of severe hemophilia is spontaneous and recurrent bleeding into joints, muscles, and soft tissues. Unpreventable bleeding may cause arthropathy, chronic discomfort, and muscular atrophy. Therefore, joints' functional loss affects the functional and walking ability. The aim of this study was to determine the walking ability by measuring the 50-m walk test time in severe hemophilic patients, as compared to the normal population. Sixty subjects (males) in the 18-30 year age group were selected and comprised 30 hemophiliacs and 30 in a control group. The 50-m walking ability was measured in seconds. The results showed a normative value of 36.6 sec in the control and 67.2 sec in the hemophilic group. Statistical analysis of the data showed that the walking ability was significantly reduced in the hemophilic group. These normative values illustrate a useful, simple, reproducible, rapid assessment of walking disability in adults with hemophilic arthropathy, and also aid the planning of treatment."

    "abstract": "Inhibition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an emerging therapeutic strategy for treatment of hemophilia. Concizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds TFPI and blocks its inhibition of factor (F)Xa thereby extending the initiation of coagulation and compensating for lack of FVIII or FIX. The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate how concizumab affects clot formation in hemophilia A under flow. Blood was collected from normal controls or people with hemophilia A. An anti-FVIII antibody was added to normal controls to simulate hemophilia A with inhibitory antibodies to FVIII. Whole blood and recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa, 25 nM) or concizumab (200, 1000, and 4000 ng/mL) were perfused at 100 s<sup>-1</sup> over a surface micropatterned with tissue factor (TF) and collagen-related peptide. Platelet and fibrin(ogen) accumulation were measured by confocal microscopy. Static thrombin generation in plasma was measured in response to rFVIIa and concizumab. Concizumab (1000 and 4000 ng/mL) and rFVIIa both rescued (93%-101%) total platelet accumulation, but only partially rescued (53%-63%) fibrin(ogen) incorporation to normal control levels in simulated hemophilia A. Results using congenital hemophilia A blood confirmed effects of rFVIIa and concizumab. While these 2 agents had similar effect on clot formation under flow, concizumab enhanced thrombin generation in plasma under static conditions to a greater extent than rFVIIa. TFPI inhibition by concizumab enhanced activation and aggregation of platelets and fibrin clot formation in hemophilia A to levels comparable with that of rFVIIa."

    "abstract": "With the treatment landscape continually evolving, it is vital that the hemophilia community have an overview of all published data for approved therapies, such as emicizumab, to support shared decision making. To bring together the clinical and real-world data for emicizumab use in people with congenital hemophilia A, regardless of age, disease severity, or factor VIII inhibitor status. Key focus areas were safety, efficacy, and quality of life (QoL). This scoping review used citation databases (PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) and manual searches of abstract books. Publications reporting original data for emicizumab in people with hemophilia A, published in English after December 2014, and reporting select endpoints were included. This narrative synthesis focused on zero bleeds, treated annualized bleeding rate (ABR), adverse events, and QoL measures. Overall, 97 publications were included (cut-off: August 9, 2022). Treated ABR remained low (calculated mean and median treated ABRs ranged between 0.7-1.3 and 0.0-1.4, respectively), and the median percentage of people with zero treated bleeds was 66.7%. The proportion of people experiencing treatment-related adverse events ranged from 0.0% to 60.0%; most were injection-site reactions. Across 37 publications reporting on safety and enrolling >2300 individuals, 11 thrombotic events and 4 thrombotic microangiopathies were reported. Data from well-established tools show QoL benefits with emicizumab. This scoping review consolidates the global published experience for emicizumab in people with hemophilia A and supports the fact that emicizumab has an acceptable safety profile, is effective and efficacious in bleed prevention, and is associated with improvements in QoL."

To construct a predictive model for inhibitor development in HA using a network of clinical variables and biomarkers based on the individual similarity network. Previously untreated and minimally treated children with severe/moderately severe HA, participants of the HEMFIL Cohort Study, were followed up until reaching 75 exposure days (EDs) without inhibitor (INH-) or upon inhibitor development (INH+). Clinical data and biological samples were collected before the start of factor (F)VIII replacement (T0). A predictive model (HemfilNET) was built to compare the networks and potential global topological differences between INH- and INH+ at T0, considering the network robustness. For validation, the \"leave-one-out\" cross-validation technique was employed. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used as evaluation metrics for the machine-learning model. We included 95 children with HA (CHA), of whom 31 (33%) developed inhibitors. The algorithm, featuring 37 variables, identified distinct patterns of networks at T0 for INH+ and INH-. The accuracy of the model was 74.2% for CHA INH+ and 98.4% for INH-. By focusing the analysis on CHA with high-risk F8 mutations for inhibitor development, the accuracy in identifying CHA INH+ increased to 82.1%. Our machine-learning algorithm demonstrated an overall accuracy of 90.5% for predicting inhibitor development in CHA, which further improved when restricting the analysis to CHA with a high-risk F8 genotype. However, our model requires validation in other cohorts. Yet, missing data for some variables hindered more precise predictions."

    "title": "Emicizumab as a Promising Form of Therapy for Type A Hemophilia - A Review of Current Knowledge from Clinical Trials.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a plasma bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of certain blood clotting factors. The most common forms of this disease, i.e., type A and type B, affect approximately 400,000 people worldwide. Without appropriate treatment ensuring the proper coagulation cascade, this disease may lead to serious disability. Minimizing patient discomfort is possible via replacement therapy, consisting of the substitution of a missing coagulation factor <i>via</i> intravenous administration. Frequent medication and the risk related to factor inhibitors are significant disadvantages, necessitating the improvement of current therapies or the development of novel ones. This review examines the humanized bispecific antibody Emicizumab which ensures hemostasis by mimicking the action of the coagulation factor VIII, a deficiency of which causes type A hemophilia. The paper outlines the topic and then summarizes available clinical trials on Emicizumab in type A hemophilia. Several interventional clinical trials have found Emicizumab to be effective in decreasing bleeding episodes and raising patient satisfaction among various hemophilia A populations. Current Emicizumab-related trials are forecast to be completed between 2024 and 2030, and in addition to congenital hemophilia A, the trials cover acquired hemophilia A and patients playing sports. Providing a more comprehensive understanding of Emicizumab may revolutionize the management of hemophilia type A and improve quality of life. Conclusively, Emicizumab is a gentler therapy owing to subcutaneous delivery and fewer injections, which reduces injection-site reactions and makes therapy less burdensome, ultimately decreasing hospital visits and indirect costs."

Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is an AAV serotype 5 (AAV5)-vectored gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A that encodes a B-domain-deleted human factor VIII (FVIII) protein controlled by a hepatocyte-selective promoter. Following previous results from the first-in-human phase 1/2 clinical trial, we assessed AAV5-capsid- and transgene-derived FVIII-specific immune responses with 2 years of follow-up data from GENEr8-1, a phase 3, single-arm, open-label study in 134 adult men with severe hemophilia A. No FVIII inhibitors were detected following administration of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. Immune responses were predominantly directed toward the AAV5 capsid, with all participants developing durable anti-AAV5 antibodies. Cellular immune responses specific for the AAV5 capsid were detected in most participants by interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay 2 weeks following dose administration and declined or reverted to negative over the first 52 weeks. These responses were weakly correlated with alanine aminotransferase elevations and showed no association with changes in FVIII activity. FVIII-specific cellular immune responses were less frequent and more sporadic compared with those specific for AAV5 and showed no association with safety or efficacy parameters."

    "abstract": "This retrospective cohort study evaluates the safety and efficacy of replacement therapy with regard to pregnancy outcomes in hemophilia carriers. Hemophilia carriers face elevated bleeding risks during pregnancy, necessitating meticulous management, including replacement therapy with clotting factors. This research examines the records of 64 pregnant hemophilia carriers at King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, from January 2010 to December 2023, analyzing their demographic details, hemophilia type and severity, replacement therapy specifics, and pregnancy outcomes. The study found that 62.5% of the participants had hemophilia A, with 43.8% categorized as severe. Most subjects (87.5%) received recombinant factor VIII at a median dosage of 30 IU/kg weekly. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included gestational hypertension (15.6%), preterm labor (18.8%), and postpartum hemorrhage (12.5%). The cesarean section rate was 28.1%. Neonatal outcomes were generally favorable, with median birth weights at 3100 g and mean Apgar scores of 8.2 and 9.1 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed no significant association between adverse events and therapy type or dosage, though a trend towards significance was noted with once-weekly administration (<i>p</i> = 0.082). The study concludes that replacement therapy is a viable method for managing hemophilia in pregnant carriers, leading to generally favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, it underscores the importance of individualized treatment plans and close monitoring to effectively manage the risks associated with hemophilia during pregnancy."

Only a few case reports have been experienced with influenza vaccine-triggered AHA. Here, we report a case of severe hemorrhagic disorder due to AHA following influenza vaccine, which was successfully treated. The patient presented to the emergency department because of several severe, progressively worsening bruises after receiving the influenza vaccination. Consequently, the patient required intubation due to nasal-oral bleeding, which compromised the airway, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage with shock also developed. AHA was confirmed through a coagulation factor assay, including coagulation activity and antibody testing, which is possibly triggered by influenza vaccination. Low-dose cyclophosphamide and hydrocortisone were prescribed until activated partial thromboplastin time showed normal levels. Coagulation factor VIIa was administered, and aggressive blood transfusion was carried out concurrently to address the blood loss. The upper airway bleeding subsided and bleeding tendencies had been corrected to normal. The patient was smoothly weaned from the ventilator and recovered from critical illness. She was then discharged on the 19th day. The activated partial thromboplastin time mixing test can be performed immediately to establish the initial differential diagnosis and treatment plan for severe coagulopathy. AHA may be triggered by vaccination, with the hypothesis of activation of autoantibodies and molecular mimicry; this mechanism should be further studied."

This post hoc analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of emicizumab in people with HA aged ≥50 years with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors or HIV and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The HAVEN 1 (NCT02622321), HAVEN 3 (NCT02847637), HAVEN 4 (NCT03020160), and STASEY (NCT03191799) studies enrolled adults/adolescents with severe HA. Participants were categorized as having a comorbidity if they had any CV risk factors (including history of CV disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, prior stroke, or obesity), HIV, and/or HCV infection. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared by age (<50 vs ≥50 years). Of 504 participants at data cutoff, 408 were aged <50 years and 96 were aged ≥50 years. In people with HA aged <50 years, 26.7% had ≥1 CV risk factor and 29.4% had HIV and/or HCV infection. In people with HA aged ≥50 years, 72.9% had ≥1 CV risk factor and 74.0% had HIV and/or HCV infection. The mean (95% CI) annualized bleed rate for treated bleeds was 1.29 (0.07-6.06) for people with HA aged <50 years and 1.82 (0.19-6.93) for people with HA aged ≥50 years. No significant differences in annualized bleed rates were observed for those with comorbidities compared with those without. Safety outcomes were similar regardless of age. This pooled analysis suggests that emicizumab efficacy and safety in people with HA aged ≥50 years with CV and HIV/HCV comorbidities were consistent with those in people with HA aged <50 years enrolled in the HAVEN 1, 3, and 4 and STASEY studies."

A steering committee of four experts (two haemophilia specialists, one thrombosis specialist, one cardiologist) identified 44 statements related to five key themes. An online questionnaire was produced comprising a mix of 4-point Likert scale and multiple-choice questions that was sent to specialists in the management of PWH with CVD in Japan. Consensus was defined as high or very high if a respective ≥75% or ≥90% of respondents agreed with a statement. Of 16 potential respondents, responses were received from 15 specialists. Of the Likert scale questions, 71% (29/41) achieved ≥90% agreement (very strong agreement), 17% (7/41) achieved 75%-89% agreement (strong agreement) and 15% (6/41) did not achieve consensus agreement. The three multiple-choice questions failed to identify a strong preference. Agreement on specific target trough clotting factor levels for managing certain clinical situations, such as when in the presence of non-valvular atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction, was also achieved.

Four, image-based, finite element models of haemophilic ankles were simulated through consecutive events in the stance phase of gait, using both patient-specific and healthy control group (n = 36) biomechanical inputs. One healthy control FE model was simulated through the healthy control stance phase of the gait cycle for a point of comparison. The method developed allowed cartilage contact mechanics to be assessed throughout the loading phase of the gait cycle. This showed areas of increased contact pressure in the medial and lateral regions of the talar dome, which may be linked to collapse in these regions. This method may allow the relationship between structure and function in the tibiotalar joint to be better understood."

Systematic review of interventions and meta-analysis conducted at the Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil. The CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and LILACS databases were searched on February 21, 2023. Two authors conducted the literature search, publication selection, and data extraction. The selected publications evaluated the bleeding endpoints between PwHAi on emicizumab prophylaxis and those on BPA prophylaxis. The risk of bias was evaluated according to the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for treated bleeds. Five publications (56 PwHAi) were selected from the 543 retrieved records. Overall, bleeding endpoints were lower during emicizumab prophylaxis than during BPA prophylaxis. All the publications had at least one risk of bias. The only common parameter for the meta-analysis was the ABR for treated bleeds. During emicizumab prophylaxis, the ABR for treated bleeds was lower than during BPA prophylaxis (standard mean difference: -1.58; 95% confidence interval -2.50, -0.66, P = 0.0008; I2 = 68.4%, P = 0.0031). Emicizumab was superior to BPA in bleeding prophylaxis in PwHAi. However, both the small population size and potential risk of bias should be considered when evaluating these results.

Through this retrospective review, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of hemophilia A-affected individuals' clinical and molecular characteristics, as well as the reproductive choices of the at-risk couples. A total of 122 individuals harboring likely causative F8 gene alterations from 64 apparently unrelated families attending three centers between 3/2000 and 3/2023 were included in this study. Their clinical and molecular findings as well as reproductive choices were gathered in a clinical setting and verified through the electronic medical record database of the public health system. Forty-seven affected males and 75 female heterozygous carriers were included in the analysis. Among 64 apparently unrelated families, 36 distinct pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified, of which 30.6% (11/36) of variants were novel. While the majority of clinical findings and genotype-phenotype correlations appear to be in accordance with existing literature, female carriers who had no fertility intention were significantly more likely to have affected sons than those who had fertility intention (5/19 vs. 4/5; p = 0.047).

Patients diagnosed with hemophilia A were enrolled. Clinical phenotype assignment was performed according to the published literature, and patients were classified into four phenotypic subgroups. The whole blood sample was first run on ROTEM in INTEM mode using platelet-poor plasma, APTT was run, and the APTT-CWA graph was simultaneously recorded. A total of 66 patients were recruited for this study. Statistically significant differences were observed between the four phenotypically categorized groups using ROTEM and APTT-CWA. On comparing patients with mild/moderate-to-severe phenotypes (Group II) with SHA without inhibitors (Group IV), no significant difference was found for all parameters of ROTEM or APTT-CWA. The MCF, MA30, MAXV, and Alpha angle values using ROTEM were found to be the lowest in patients with SHA with inhibitors, which helped differentiate them from those with SHA without inhibitors. However, these two groups could not be differentiated using the APTT-CWA parameters. ROTEM can be used to distinguish patients with SHA with inhibitors from those with SHA without inhibitors using a combination of parameters with high sensitivity and specificity. However, APTT-CWA cannot be used to differentiate these patient groups."

    "title": "A 360-degree perspective on adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy for haemophilia: Insights from the physician, the nurse and the patient.",
    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy for haemophilia has advanced substantially in the last 13 years; recently, three products have received approvals from regulatory authorities. Although the impact on quality of life seems promising, some limitations remain, such as the presence of pre-existing anti-AAV neutralising antibodies and the occurrence of hepatotoxicity. This review follows the CSL Behring-sponsored symposium at the 27th Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2022 that examined the haemophilia gene therapy process from a 360-degree multidisciplinary perspective. Here, the faculty (haematologist, nurse and haemophilia patient) summarised their own viewpoints from the symposium, with the aim of highlighting the key considerations required to engage with gene therapy effectively, for both patients and providers, as well as the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, including with industry. When considering these new therapies, patients face a complex decision-making process, which includes whether gene therapy is right for them at their current stage of life. The authors agreed that collaboration and tailored education across the multidisciplinary team (including patients and their carers/families), starting early in the process and continuing throughout the long-term follow-up period, is key for the success of gene therapy. Additionally, patient expectations, which may surround eligibility, follow-up requirements and treatment outcomes, should be continually explored. During these ongoing discussions, transparent communication of the unknown factors, such as anticipated clotting factor levels, long-term factor expression and safety, and psychological changes, is critical. To ensure efficiency and comprehensiveness, clearly‑defined protocols should outline the whole process, which should include the recording and management of long-term effects. In order to engage effectively, both patients and providers should be familiar with these key considerations prior to their involvement with the haemophilia gene therapy process. The future after the approval of haemophilia gene therapies remains to be seen and real-world evidence is eagerly awaited."

    "abstract": "In the context of severe unexplained haemorrhage (SH), it is usual to seek haematological evaluation and investigate for an inherited rare bleeding disorder (IRBD). In such circumstances, appropriate screen can discriminate between IRBD and suspected child abuse. Yet, little information is available about the frequency of SH in the population of patients with IRBD. To collect epidemiologic data about SH and IRBD. The database of the FranceCoag network has collected information about IRBD since January 2004. Based on data gathered up to 16 March 2022, a retrospective search was conducted for of SH events having occurred before or at the time of IRBD diagnosis. Demographics and diagnosis circumstances were retrieved, as well as information about SH, defined as any life-threatening bleeding or intracranial haemorrhage. Among the 13,433 patients of the database, 109 (0.8%) fulfilled inclusion criteria including a known date of IRBD diagnosis, haemophilia A or B (HA/HB) being the most frequent (82.5%). IRBD was discovered as a consequence of an SH event in 82.6% of the cases while CNS was involved in 55%. Severe and moderate HA/HB and other severe IRBD presented significantly more intracranial haemorrhage (p < .02) and a lower age at diagnosis (p = .03). These data support that any unusual SH should raise a suspicion of IRBD. Particularly before 1-year of age, it is suggested to first confirm moderate or severe haemophilia and severe IRBD by standard coagulation tests (APTT, PT and fibrinogen), combined with a clotting FXIII assay as first-line investigation. Subsequent assays of coagulation factors should be performed in the case of abnormal values, in second-line investigation."

    "abstract": "People with severe hemophilia A usually experience their first bleed early in life. In children with severe hemophilia A, primary prophylaxis is recommended to prevent recurrent and potentially life-threatening bleeds that significantly impact day-to-day life. Factor VIII (FVIII) prophylaxis is well-established in children and has been shown to reduce the development of hemophilic arthropathy. However, a major challenge of FVIII therapy is the development of neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies (FVIII inhibitors). Simoctocog alfa (Nuwiq<sup>®</sup>) is a human cell line-derived recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) whose immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety have been studied in 167 children with severe hemophilia A across two prospective clinical trials and their long-term extensions. In 105 previously untreated children, the inhibitor rate of 16.2% for high-titer inhibitors (26.7% for all inhibitors) was lower than published rates for hamster cell line-derived rFVIII products. There was no inhibitor development in previously untreated children with non-null <i>F8</i> mutations and in previously treated children. In a case series of 10 inhibitor patients, 8 (80%) underwent successful immune tolerance induction with simoctocog alfa with a median time to undetectable inhibitor of 3.5 months. In an analysis of 96 children who enrolled in the extension studies and received long-term simoctocog alfa prophylaxis for up to 5 years, median spontaneous, joint, and total annualized bleeding rates were 0.3, 0.4, and 1.8, respectively. No thromboembolisms were reported in any of the 167 children, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Optimal care of children should consider several factors, including minimization of inhibitor development risk, maintaining tolerance to FVIII, highly effective bleed prevention and treatment, safety, and impact on long-term outcomes such as bone and joint health. In this context we review the pediatric clinical data and ongoing studies with simoctocog alfa."

Evolving Treatment of Hemophilia's Impact on Neurodevelopment, Intelligence, and Other Cognitive Functions (eTHINK) is a US-based, prospective, cross-sectional, observational study (September 2018 through October 2019). Males (aged 1-21 years) with hemophilia A or B of any severity, with or without inhibitors, were eligible. Participants underwent neurologic examinations and age-appropriate neuropsychological assessments, including standardized tests/ratings scales of early development, cognition, emotional/behavioral adjustment, and adaptive skills. Five hundred and fifty-one males with hemophilia A (n = 433) or B (n = 101) were enrolled. Performance on cognitive tests was largely comparable with that of age-matched US population norms, although participants in certain age groups (4-5 and 10-21 years) performed worse on measures of attention and processing speed. Furthermore, adolescents and young adults and those with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 64) reported more adaptive and executive function problems in daily life. Incidence of ADHD in adolescents (21%) was higher than expected in the general population. In general, males with hemophilia demonstrated age-appropriate intellectual, behavioral, and adaptive development. However, specific patient/age groups showed poorer attention performance and concerns for executive and adaptive development.

    "abstract": "People with nonsevere hemophilia (PWNSH) are phenotypically more diverse than those with severe hemophilia. Perceptions relating to a \"nonsevere\" phenotype have contributed to fewer research initiatives, fewer guidelines on optimal management, and a lack of standards for surveillance and clinical assessment for affected individuals. In many cases, episodes of abnormal bleeding could, if investigated, have led to earlier diagnosis. Furthermore, the major recent developments in therapy for hemophilia have largely focused on severe disease and, as a group, PWNSH have not been included in many key clinical trials. Benefiting people with severe disease, innovative replacement therapies have generally targeted factor levels that are above those present in a large proportion of PWNSH. Therapeutic advances can lead to improvement in phenotype for people with severe hemophilia over that currently experienced by many PWNSH. As a result, we are approaching a point where PWNSH may, in many countries, have a higher risk of bleeding and restriction in lifestyle than those with severe disease but with more limited therapeutic options. Given the multiple major advances in treatment for people with hemophilia, it is timely to review the aspects of nonsevere disease, to ensure equity in care and management for all individuals with this condition."

    "title": "Major Orthopaedic Surgery in Persons with Haemophilia A with and without Inhibitors Treated by Emicizumab: A Mid-Term, Large, and Successful Series at a Single Center.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Patients with Haemophilia (PWH) need orthopaedic treatments and often they undergo surgery. Classically, PWH with inhibitors have to face such procedures earlier than other patients. Major orthopaedic surgery is not easy and complications are frequent. Emicizumab is the first monoclonal antibody introduced for haematological prophylaxis for PWH with inhibitors, achieving an efficacious haemostasis also in patients with severe haemophilia A with inhibitors, later demonstrated for PWH without inhibitors. A few years ago, emicizumab was also proposed for PWH undergoing surgery, as it supports excellent bleeding control. The literature on orthopaedic surgery using an emicizumab protocol is scarce: only isolated case reports with short-term follow-ups are available. <b>Aim:</b> The purpose of this study is the assessment of the mid-term outcomes of major orthopaedic surgery performed in a population of patients with and without inhibitors and an emicizumab regimen. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed the records of 13 PWH (eight with high-titre inhibitors, five without) with a mean age of 54.6 years, undergoing 15 orthopaedic surgical procedures between 2017 and 2022: primary knee and hip arthroplasty, revision, pseudotumor excision, or amputation. Their prophylaxis consisted of the combination of emicizumab and boluses of rFVIIa (PWH with inhibitors) or rFVIII (PWH without inhibitors). The clinical parameters of evaluation were: VAS, Haemophilic Joint Health Score (HJHS), and standard radiologic studies. Follow-up was conducted at 1, 3, 6 months, and then yearly. The survival rate of all implants was also assessed. <b>Results:</b> The mean follow-up was 38.8 months (range: 12-65). All patients were successfully treated without complications during surgery. During the postoperative period, a patient affected by a septic complication two months after his pseudotumor excision underwent an above-the-knee amputation. All patients were regularly discharged to the rehabilitative ward, reporting satisfaction for pain reduction and improved joint and global function at the VAS and HJHS scores. No revisions or implant failures were recorded. <b>Conclusions:</b> A prophylaxis regimen with emicizumab and factor replacement in PWH with or without inhibitors undergoing major orthopaedic surgery ensures effective bleeding control and good postoperative clinical outcomes at mid-term follow-up, and may be routinely adopted in dedicated high-volume hospitals. This series is the most consistent to date reported at a single Haemophilia centre."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is a genetic disorder of hemostasis associated with a deficiency or reduced activity of clotting factor VIII (FVIII). This disorder remains unacceptably underdiagnosed in India. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of HA can substantially prevent morbidity and mortality. Currently, HA is managed with regular replacement therapy using standard or extended half-life FVIII concentrates or non-factor drug products. The challenges associated with FVIII concentrates include plateauing of drug effect, issues with its administration and adherence to treatment, breakthrough bleeds, and the development of inhibiting antibodies against administered clotting factors. Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody, launched in India in April 2019, for managing patients with HA. To investigate the role of emicizumab in Indian patients with HA, opinions were sought from 13 eminent hematologists and experts from India on the effectiveness of emicizumab in preventing all bleeds, spontaneous bleeds, perioperative bleeds, and intracranial hemorrhage; resolving target joints; and reducing the rate of hospitalizations and fatality associated with HA in children and adults, with or without inhibitors. The benefits of emicizumab over traditional FVIII concentrates include the subcutaneous route of delivery, less frequent dosing, and a lack of inhibitor development, in addition to providing sustained hemostasis without in-depth monitoring. It is a safe and effective management option for all HA patients, especially for patients with certain archetypes, such as those with inhibitors, those with high annualized bleed rates, those living far away from hemophilia care centers, pediatric patients and infants with intravenous access challenges, and those with a history of life-threatening bleeding events."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Hemophilia is a congenital disorder characterized by deficiency or absence of clotting factor VIII in hemophilia A (HA) or clotting factor IX in hemophilia B (HB), resulting in frequent, repeated, and prolonged spontaneous or traumatic bleeding into joints or soft tissue. Severity is classified by the patient's baseline level of clotting factor activity as mild (>5%-40%), moderate (1%-5%), or severe (<1%). In Spain, there is limited information on the societal economic burden of disease. <b>Objective:</b> To estimate the economic and humanistic burden of disease in adult patients with non-inhibitor moderate and severe HA and HB in Spain. <b>Methods:</b> Spanish data from the CHESS II study (2018-2020) on patients' clinical characteristics, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and hemophilia-related healthcare resource utilization were analyzed. Economic burden was determined by estimating condition-related annual per-patient direct (medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs, stratified according to hemophilia type and severity and presented as 2022 Euros. HRQoL was assessed via the EQ-5D-5L. <b>Results:</b> Of 341 patients in the Spanish CHESS II cohort, 288 patients met the inclusion criteria: 181 had HA (37% [n = 66] moderate and 63% [n=115] severe) and 107 had HB (26% [n = 28] moderate and 74% [n = 79] severe). Mean annual direct cost was higher in HB than in HA, and higher in severe than in moderate patients, resulting in an annual cost/patient of €17 251 (moderate HA), €17 796 (moderate HB), €116 767 (severe HA) and €206 996 (severe HB). The main direct cost component in all groups except moderate HA was factor replacement therapy. Mean per-patient indirect cost was €4089 (moderate HA), €797 (moderate HB), €8633 (severe HA) and €8049 (severe HB). Finally, the mean total cost (direct and indirect) for moderate and severe patients were €91 017 (HA) and €163 924 (HB). EQ-5D-5L [SD] scores were lower in patients with severe HA (0.77 [0.18]) and severe HB (0.70 [0.22]) compared with patients with moderate HA (0.81 [0.15]) and moderate HB (0.86 [0.17]). <b>Conclusions:</b> Independently of the type of hemophilia, greater condition severity was associated with increased costs and a decrease in HRQoL."

    "abstract": "To assess the cost-effectiveness of emicizumab prophylaxis for patients having haemophilia A with inhibitors in the Indian context using an adaptive health technology assessment (aHTA) methodology. Economic evaluation using multiple approaches aimed at adjusting previously generated cost-effectiveness results based on (1) price differences only ('simple') and (2) differences in cost and expected treatment duration ('moderate') and differences in cost, inflation and life expectancy ('complex'). Typical haemophilia care in India. Patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors. Emicizumab prophylaxis using two vial strengths (30 or 150 mg/mL) in comparison to no prophylaxis. Adjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERa), incremental costs and incremental quality-adjusted life years associated with emicizumab prophylaxis from both the health system and societal perspectives. Using the simple ICER adjustment method, emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in potential cost savings from the payers' perspective for both vial strengths in patients aged ≥12 and <12 years. However, from a societal perspective, emicizumab prophylaxis was not cost-effective. Using the moderate adjustment method, emicizumab prophylaxis showed potential cost saving from the health system perspective. The complex adjustment method also revealed cost savings for emicizumab prophylaxis from the health system and societal perspectives across different age groups. We found that implementing emicizumab prophylaxis for patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors in India has the potential to result in cost savings. This study highlights the feasibility of using the expanded aHTA methodology for rapid evidence generation in the Indian context. However, it is crucial to address certain research gaps, including data limitations, challenges in translating international evidence to Indian context and associated uncertainties. Additionally, conducting a comprehensive budget impact analysis is necessary. These findings hold significant implications for decision-making regarding the potential provision of emicizumab prophylaxis through federal or/and state government-funded programmes and institutions in India."

Skewed XCI (SXCI) may be involved in symptomatic HA carriers. We aimed to develop an approach for dissecting the specific cause of SXCI and verify its value in HA. A family involving three females (two symptomatic with severe/moderate HA: I.2, the mother, and II.1, the daughter; one asymptomatic: II.2) and two related affected males (I.1, the father and I.3, the maternal uncle) was studied. The genetic analysis included <i>F8</i> mutational screening, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, SNP microarray, whole exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing. XCI patterns were assessed in ectoderm/endoderm and mesoderm-derived tissues using <i>AR</i>-based and <i>RP2</i>-based systems. The comprehensive family analysis identifies I.2 female patient as a heterozygous carrier of <i>F8</i>:p.(Ser1414Ter) excluding copy number variations. A consistent XCI pattern of 99.5% across various tissues was observed. A comprehensive filtering algorithm for WES data was designed, developed and applied to I.2. A Gly58Arg missense variant in <i>VMA21</i> was revealed as the cause for SXCI.Each step of the variant filtering system takes advantage of publicly available genomic databases, non-SXCI controls and case-specific molecular data, and aligns with established concepts in the theoretical background of SXCI. This study acts as a proof of concept for our genomic filtering algorithm's clinical utility in analysing X linked disorders. Our findings clarify the molecular aspects of SXCI and improve genetic diagnostics and counselling for families with X linked diseases like HA."

Evaluation of rescue in engineered blood outgrowth endothelial cells by lentiviral-mediated delivery of BE. Transient assays identified the best-performing BE/PE systems for each variant, with the highest rescue of FVIII expression (up to 25% of wild-type recombinant FVIII) for the p.R2166∗ and p.R2228Q mutations. In stable clones, we demonstrated that the mutation reversion on DNA (∼24%) was consistent with the rescue of FVIII secretion and activity of 20% to 30%. The lentiviral-mediated delivery of the selected BE systems was attempted in engineered blood outgrowth endothelial cells harboring the p.R2166∗ and p.R2228Q variants, which led to an appreciable and dose-dependent rescue of secreted functional FVIII. Overall data provide the first proof-of-concept for effective BE/PE-mediated correction of HA-causing mutations, which encourage studies in mouse models to develop a personalized cure for large cohorts of patients through a single intervention."

However, it is now recognized that variants of F8 in females can result in HA. Nonetheless, most females go undiagnosed and untreated for HA, and their bleeding complications are attributed to other causes. Predicting the severity of HA for female patients can provide valuable insights for treating the conditions associated with the disease, such as heavy bleeding. To predict the severity of HA based on F8 genotype using a machine learning (ML) approach. Using multiple datasets of variants in the F8 and disease severity from various repositories, we derived the sequence for the FVIII protein. Using the derived sequences, we used ML models to predict the severity of HA in female patients. Utilizing different classification models, we highlight the validity of the datasets and our approach with predictive F1 scores of 0.88, 0.99, 0.93, 0.99, and 0.90 for all the validation sets. Although with some limitations, ML-based approaches demonstrated the successful prediction of disease severity in female HA patients based on variants in the F8. This study confirms previous research findings that ML can help predict the severity of hemophilia. These results can be valuable for future studies in achieving better treatment and clinical outcomes for female patients with HA, which is an urgent unmet need."

We have developed an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) based strategy to integrate the bypass coagulation factor, activated FVII (murine, mFVIIa) gene into the Rosa26 locus using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 mediated gene-editing. AAV vectors designed for expression of guide RNA (AAV8-gRNA), Cas9 (AAV2 neddylation mutant-Cas9), and mFVIIa (AAV8-mFVIIa) flanked by homology arms of the target locus were validated in vitro. Hemophilia B mice were administered with AAV carrying gRNA, Cas9 (1 × 10<sup>11</sup> vgs/mouse), and mFVIIa with homology arms (2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vgs/mouse) with appropriate controls. Functional rescue was documented with suitable coagulation assays at various time points. The data from the T7 endonuclease assay revealed a cleavage efficiency of 20-42 %. Further, DNA sequencing confirmed the targeted integration of mFVIIa into the safe-harbor Rosa26 locus. The prothrombin time (PT) assay revealed a significant reduction in PT in mice that received the gene-editing vectors (22 %), and a 13 % decline in mice that received only the AAV-FVIIa when compared to mock treated mice, 8 weeks after vector administration. Furthermore, FVIIa activity in mice that received triple gene-editing vectors was higher (122.5mIU/mL vs 28.8mIU/mL) than the mock group up to 15 weeks post vector administration. A hemostatic challenge by tail clip assay revealed that hemophilia B mice injected with only FVIIa or the gene-editing vectors had significant reduction in blood loss. In conclusion, AAV based gene-editing facilitates sustained expression of coagulation FVIIa and phenotypic rescue in hemophilia B mice."

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of joint damage is pivotal in haemophilia to prevent the occurrence and progression of haemophilic arthropathy thus providing optimal personalised management. The haemophilia joint health score version 2.1 (HJHS) is based on a physical examination of the mainly affected joints. Musculoskeletal ultrasound has demonstrated the capability to detect early changes in terms of synovitis and osteochondral damage. The haemophilia early detection with ultrasound (HEAD-US) score has been proposed as a simple and reliable evaluation tool. This study aims to investigate the correlation between the HJHS and the HEAD-US scores performed by two independent operators (physical therapist and musculoskeletal ultrasound expert) for the evaluation of the joint health status of patients with haemophilia. Consecutive adult patients independent of the severity degree were included. Elbows, knees and ankles were evaluated by a physical therapist by HJHS and by a musculoskeletal ultrasound expert following the HEAD-US protocol. We observed a good positive correlation between HJHS and HEAD-US (Spearman's rho 0.72). The main discrepancy in conceptually similar domains was found between the HJHS swelling and the HEAD-US synovitis (rho 0.17), as ultrasound was able to detect even mild synovitis when HJHS swelling was scored 0 in up to 40% of cases. The HJHS and HEAD-US correlate well even when performed by two independent operators. Musculoskeletal ultrasound is particularly useful for the early detection of synovitis. The routine assessment of both scores helps clinicians define the stage and extension of joint involvement and set up a personalised treatment."

The first products have already been licensed in the European Union for the treatment of immune deficiency, spinal muscular atrophy, hemophilia, retinal dystrophy, a rare neurotransmitter disorder and some hematological cancers, while many more are being assessed in preclinical and clinical trials. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the core principles of gene therapy along with information on challenges and risks. Benefits, adverse effects and potential risks are illustrated based on the examples of hemophilia and spinal muscular atrophy. At present, in-vitro and in-vivo gene addition or gene augmentation is the most commonly established type of gene therapy. More recently, more sophisticated and precise approaches such as in situ gene editing have moved into focus. However, all types of gene therapy require long-term observation of treated patients to ensure safety, efficacy, predictability and durability. Important safety concerns include immune reactions to the vector, the foreign DNA or the new protein resulting from gene therapy, and a remaining low cancer risk based on insertional mutagenesis. Ethical and regulatory issues need to be addressed, and new reimbursement models are called for to ease the financial burden that this new treatment poses for the health care system. Gene therapy holds great promise for considerable improvement or even cure of genetic diseases with serious clinical consequences. However, a number of questions and issues need to be clarified to ensure broad accessibility of safe and efficacious products."

    "abstract": "Regular assessment of motor impairments is crucial in people with haemophilic arthropathy (PwHA). This study aimed to determine if there are differences in 30-seconds sit-to-stand (30-STS) power and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors between PwHA and healthy control group (CG). The secondary aims were to investigate the correlation between 30-STS power and MVIC of knee extensors with clinical characteristics and to assess their effectiveness in identifying motor impairment in PwHA. A cross-sectional study was conducted by collecting data from PwHA (n = 17) and a sedentary CG (n = 15). MVIC (torque) and 30-STS power were normalised to body mass. Correlation analysis and simple linear regression adjusted for age were used to assess the association between tests and clinical variables. Using z-scores derived from the mean and standard deviation of the CG, we compared the MVIC and the 30-STS power in PwHA. PwHA showed lower MVIC and 30-STS power compared to CG (p < .001; large effect size d > .8). Lower 30-STS power was associated with greater joint impairment and greater fear of movement, whereas MVIC showed no association with clinical variables. 30-STS power showed a lower z-score compared to MVIC (p < .001). In addition, 30-STS power detected 47% of PwHA with motor impairment compared to 0% for MVIC (p = .002). Our results suggest that 30-STS power may be more effective than knee extensors MVIC in detecting motor impairment in PwHA. Consequently, lower limb skeletal muscle power, rather than maximum knee extensor strength, appears to be more affected in PwHA."

    "title": "Inhibitor eradication and treatment for acquired hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare hemorrhagic autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). In approximately half of the cases AHA does not recognize any cause (idiopathic form), while in the other cases it may be triggered by autoimmune disorders, cancers, drugs, infections, or pregnancy. Besides treating the underlying disorder, specific AHA treatment includes management of bleeding, if necessary, and inhibitor eradication. This narrative review summarizes the main epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic characteristics of AHA. In particular, it is focused on the current therapeutic options for the inhibitor eradication, also showing the latest findings on the innovative therapies. A literature search strategy was performed, without temporal limits, through Medline and PubMed electronic databases. Various first-line and second-line immunosuppressive agents are currently available for the management of AHA. Among the latter, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been the object of intense research during the last years from investigators as innovative promising eradicating therapy for AHA. Preliminary data from the studies support the use of this drug as a first-line option for newly diagnosed AHA cases."

    "title": "Bleeding risk in hemophilia A and B carriers: comparison of factor levels determined using chronometric and chromogenic assays.",
    "abstract": "Predicting the bleeding risk in hemophilia A and B carriers (HAC, HBC) is challenging. The objectives of this study were to describe the bleeding phenotype in HAC and HBC using the standardized Tosetto bleeding score (BS); to determine whether the BS correlates better with factor levels measured with a chromogenic assay than with factor levels measured with chronometric and thrombin generation assays; and to compare the results in HAC and HBC. This ambispective, noninterventional study included obligate and sporadic HAC and HBC followed at a hemophilia treatment center between 1995 and 2019. The median BS (3, range 0-21 vs. 3.5, range 0-15, P = ns, respectively) and the abnormal BS rate (35.6% vs. 38.2%, P = ns) were not significantly different in 104 HAC and 34 HBC (mean age: 38 years, 6-80 years). However, some differences were identified. The risk of factor deficiency was higher in HBC than HAC. Specifically, Factor VIII activity (FVIII):C/Factor IX activity (FIX):C level was low (<40 IU/dl) in 18.3% (chronometric assay) and 17.5% (chromogenic assay) of HAC and in 47% and 72.2% of HBC ( P < 0.001). Moreover, the FIX:C level thresholds of 39.5 IU/dl (chronometric assay) and of 33.5 IU/dl (chromogenic assay) were associated with very good sensitivity (92% and 100%, respectively) and specificity (80% for both) for bleeding risk prediction in HBC. Conversely, no FVIII:C level threshold could be identified for HAC, probably due to FVIII:C level variations throughout life."

Acquired hemophilia A is a rare, acquired bleeding disorder that presents with new-onset bleeding, especially in older adults, due to the development of auto-antibodies against factor VIII (FVIII). This case report presents the medical management of a patient with congenital hemophilia B and acquired hemophilia A. We highlight the limitations of maintaining factor levels with factor replacement therapy alone, particularly in hemophilia patients who have developed factor inhibitors. In addition, we draw attention to the need for dose escalation, the cost, and the need for immune-tolerance induction therapy. This case illustrates that when the current diagnosis does not explain the full clinical picture and laboratory data are inadequate, it is important to continue to seek alternative diagnoses and cost-effective treatment."

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a risk factor for future cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear, limiting effective prevention strategies. Blood pressure responses to acute stimuli may reveal cardiovascular dysfunction not apparent at rest, identifying individuals at elevated cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we compared blood pressure responsiveness with acute stimuli between previously preeclamptic (PPE) women (34 ± 5 yr old, 13 ± 6 mo postpartum) and women following healthy pregnancies (Ctrl; 29 ± 3 yr old, 15 ± 4 mo postpartum). Blood pressure (finger photoplethysmography calibrated to manual sphygmomanometry-derived values; PPE: <i>n</i> = 12, Ctrl: <i>n</i> = 12) was assessed during end-expiratory apnea, mental stress, and isometric handgrip exercise protocols. Integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was assessed in a subset of participants (peroneal nerve microneurography; PPE: <i>n</i> = 6, Ctrl: <i>n</i> = 8). Across all protocols, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in PPE than Ctrl (main effects of group all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Peak changes in SBP were stressor specific: peak increases in SBP were not different between PPE and Ctrl during apnea (8 ± 6 vs. 6 ± 5 mmHg, <i>P</i> = 0.32) or mental stress (9 ± 5 vs. 4 ± 7 mmHg, <i>P</i> = 0.06). However, peak exercise-induced increases in SBP were greater in PPE than Ctrl (11 ± 5 vs. 7 ± 7 mmHg, <i>P</i> = 0.04). MSNA was higher in PPE than Ctrl across all protocols (main effects of group all <i>P</i> < 0.05), and increases in peak MSNA were greater in PPE than Ctrl during apnea (44 ± 6 vs. 27 ± 14 burst/100 hb, <i>P</i> = 0.04) and exercise (25 ± 8 vs. 13 ± 11 burst/100 hb, <i>P</i> = 0.01) but not different between groups during mental stress (2 ± 3 vs. 0 ± 5 burst/100 hb, <i>P</i> = 0.41). Exaggerated pressor and sympathetic responses to certain stimuli may contribute to the elevated long-term risk for cardiovascular disease in PPE.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Women with recent histories of preeclampsia demonstrated higher systolic blood pressures across sympathoexcitatory stressors relative to controls. Peak systolic blood pressure reactivity was exacerbated in previously preeclamptic women during small muscle-mass exercises, although not during apneic or mental stress stimuli. These findings underscore the importance of assessing blood pressure control during a variety of experimental conditions in previously preeclamptic women to elucidate mechanisms that may contribute to their elevated cardiovascular disease risk."

We investigated scheduled vaccinations and vaccination-related bleeding complications in Chinese children with haemophilia and analysed issues related to vaccinations. Children with haemophilia in the PUMCH Haemophilia Treatment Centre were contacted via telephone. We distributed a vaccination questionnaire to their parents. The severity of haemophilia, coagulation factor infusions before vaccination, injection mode, and vaccination-related complications were analysed. A total of 440 valid questionnaires were received from 27 of 34 provinces in China. 31.3% (138/440) of the children with haemophilia did not receive all of their vaccinations. Among the children who received vaccinations, 48.1% (197/409) experienced bleeding complications. In patients with severe haemophilia, those on regular prophylaxis had a lower incidence of local hematoma compared to those on intermittent or no prophylaxis (14.3% vs. 26.5% vs. 39.7%, P < 0.05). The incidence of local hematomas was lower by subcutaneous (SQ) injections than by intramuscular injections (24.6% vs. 35.3%, P < 0.05). The vaccination rate is quite insufficient in Chinese children with haemophilia. Missed vaccinations are related to vaccination-related bleeding complications. Prophylaxis before vaccination and SQ injections would help reduce bleeding complications."

    "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a serious complication in persons with hemophilia A (PWHA), causes high rates of mortality and morbidity. Identified ICH risk factors from patient data spanning 1998-2008 require reassessment in light of changes in the current treatment landscape. PWHA identified in the ATHNdataset were evaluated retrospectively to assess incidence of ICH and determine the association between ICH risk and key characteristics using time-to-event analyses (Cox proportional-hazards models, survival curves, and sensitivity analyses). Over a median follow-up time of 10.7 patient-years, 135 of 7837 PWHA over 2 years of age in the ATHNdataset (1.7%) experienced an ICH. Stratification by prophylaxis status and inhibitor status resulted in an incidence rate (IR) ratio (IRR) (IR+/IR-) of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.94; <i>P</i>=0.020) and 1.76 (95% CI, 0.97-3.20; <i>P</i>=0.059), respectively. Characteristics associated with greater risk of developing ICH include being aged 2-12 years; being covered by Medicaid; having had HIV, hepatitis C, or hypertension; and never having received factor VIII or prophylactic treatment. In multivariable analysis with interaction, the estimated hazard ratio for PWHA never receiving prophylaxis was 7.67 (95% CI, 2.24-26.30), which shrunk to 2.03 (95% CI, 1.30-9.12) in bootstrapping analysis and 3.09 in the highest-penalty ridge-regression analysis but was still significant. Inhibitor status was found not to be statistically associated with ICH in all analyses. These results align with previous studies demonstrating that prophylaxis confers a protective effect against ICH. Previously, inhibitor positivity had been shown to increase risk for ICH; however, this study did not corroborate those findings."

This study is the first to examine treatment characteristic preferences among people with haemophilia (PWH) and their caregivers, and physicians in Japan. To examine current treatment preferences of PWH and their caregivers, plus those of physicians at haemophilia treatment centres (HTCs) and non-HTCs for different treatment characteristics in Japan. Physicians listed on a survey panel were invited to participate in the survey and to refer PWH and caregivers to participate in the survey. Web-based surveys were conducted to examine physician and PWH/caregiver background, prophylaxis background, prophylaxis goals, understanding of haemophilia treatment products, important information sources, preferences while choosing prophylaxis products, understanding of the patient's condition, and potential product switching. A discrete choice experiment exercise was included in the survey. A total of 107 physicians and 44 PWH/caregivers participated in the study. Key treatment goals of physicians included optimisation of haemophilia management. PWH/caregivers were focused on quality of life and reduced treatment burden. Consistent differences in haemophilia treatment strategies at HTCs and non-HTCs were observed for prescribed treatments, preferences in choosing prophylaxis products, understanding of patients' condition, and reasons for potential product switch. Our study utilises real-world survey data and presents preferences for haemophilia treatment characteristics among physicians, PWH and their caregivers in Japan, which could encourage improvements in individualised treatment and disease management. Alignment between treatment approaches at HTCs and non-HTCs could facilitate improvements in the quality of care for PWH across Japan."

    "abstract": "Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare complications occurring in individuals with severe hemophilia, characterized by progressive cystic swellings in muscles and/or bones due to recurrent bleeding. Timely initiation of factor VIII replacement is crucial. Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare complications occurring in individuals with severe hemophilia, characterized by progressive cystic swellings in muscles and/or bones due to recurrent bleeding. Although their incidence has decreased with the advent of factor VIII replacement therapy, they still create challenges, particularly in regions with limited access to medical care. Here, we present a case report of a hemophilic pseudotumor of the knee joint in a 15-year-old male with hemophilia A. The patient presented with severe left knee pain, swelling, and restricted range of motion, prompting further investigation. Imaging studies revealed lytic lesions, and MRI bone signal changes consistent with hemophilic pseudotumors. Prompt initiation of factor VIII replacement therapy and supportive management led to a significant improvement in symptoms and joint functionality. Follow-up after 2 months showed that the swelling had significantly reduced in size, with marked improvement in the functionality of the knee joint. This case confirms what is already known in the hemophilia literature: how important it is to prevent, diagnose, and treat pseudotumors early in hemophilia. However, longer clinical and imaging follow-up of this case is necessary to determine whether the complaints associated with pseudotumors resolve with hematologic treatment or will require surgical treatment."

This study investigates the reliability and feasibility of PK-guided prophylactic dosing of factor concentrates in hemophilia A and B. In this multicenter, prospective cohort study, people of all ages with hemophilia received prophylactic treatment with factor concentrates based on individual PK parameters. During follow-up, at least 4 measured FVIII/FIX levels per patient were compared with corresponding predicted levels obtained by Bayesian forecasting. Predictive performance was defined as adequate when ≥80% of measured FVIII/FIX levels were within ±25% of prediction (relative error). Additionally, mean absolute error and mean error were calculated. In post hoc analyses, predictive performance was assessed allowing maximum absolute errors of 1 (trough), 5 (mid), and 15 (peak) IU/dL. Five-point scale questionnaires addressed feasibility of PK guidance. We included 50 patients (median age, 19 years; range: 2-72 years). Median follow-up was 36 weeks. Seventy-one percent of levels (58% trough, 83% mid, and 80% peak) were within ±25% of prediction. Mean absolute errors were 0.8 (trough), 2.0 (mid), and 8.6 (peak) IU/dL. In post hoc analyses, 81% (trough), 96% (mid), and 82% (peak) of levels were within set limits. Patients reported low burden and high satisfaction. PK-guided dosing was reliable according to post hoc analyses, based on low absolute errors that were regarded as clinically irrelevant in most cases. The predefined predictive performance was achieved in mid and peak factor levels but not in trough factor levels due to measurement inaccuracy. PK guidance also seemed feasible."

    "abstract": "Lentiviral vectors (LV) are efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery to the liver. LV integration into the chromatin of target cells ensures their transmission upon proliferation, thus allowing potentially life-long gene therapy following a single administration, even to young individuals. The glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV.G) is widely used to pseudotype LV, as it confers broad tropism and high stability. The baculovirus-derived GP64 envelope protein has been proposed as an alternative for in vivo liver-directed gene therapy. Here, we perform a detailed comparison of VSV.G- and GP64-pseudotyped LV in vitro and in vivo. We report that VSV.G-LV transduced hepatocytes better than GP64-LV, however the latter showed improved transduction of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). Combining GP64-pseudotyping with the high surface content of the phagocytosis inhibitor CD47 further enhanced LSEC transduction. Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), the gene mutated in hemophilia A, is naturally expressed by LSEC, thus we exploited GP64-LV to deliver a FVIII transgene under the control of the endogenous FVIII promoter and achieved therapeutic amounts of FVIII and correction of hemophilia A mice."

Individuals receiving emicizumab, an antibody mimicking the function of activated FVIII, were excluded from GENEr8-1 enrolment since emicizumab was an investigational therapy at the time of trial initiation. Utilize pharmacokinetic simulations to provide guidance on best practices for maintaining haemostatic control while transitioning from emicizumab prophylaxis to valoctocogene roxaparvovec. To estimate bleeding risk at weekly intervals following valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion, a published emicizumab pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate emicizumab concentrations and merged with FVIII activity time-course data for participants in GENEr8-1. The analysis investigated three approved emicizumab dosing regimens for two transition scenarios that varied whether the last dose of emicizumab was administered on the same day or 4 weeks after valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion. Simulations demonstrated administering the last emicizumab dose the day of valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion and 4 weeks after offered similar levels of haemostatic control, and bleeding risk was similar for all emicizumab dosing regimens. An algorithm was developed to provide guidance for discontinuation of emicizumab. Theoretical cases based on GENEr8-1 participants are presented to illustrate how decisions may vary among individuals. Pharmacokinetic simulations demonstrated no clinically meaningful difference in bleeding risk caused by decaying emicizumab levels and rising gene therapy-derived endogenous FVIII for all examined emicizumab doses and dosing regimens. Therefore, multiple approaches can safely transition individuals from emicizumab prophylaxis to valoctocogene roxaparvovec."

Shared decision-making (SDM) approaches have recently gained interest, though a synthesis of available studies is lacking. A scoping review was conducted to summarize literature reporting on factors impacting treatment SDM in haemophilia and tools or models available to support such decisions. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and grey literature were searched for studies published through August 2023. Original studies reporting on facilitators and barriers to haemophilia SDM and SDM tools were included and analyzed for themes, characteristics and gaps. A total of 625 records were identified and 14 unique studies were selected (factors influencing treatment SDM, n = 7; SDM tools, n = 7). The studies typically included input from persons with haemophilia, caregivers and healthcare practitioners (HCPs). Thematic organization of factors influencing SDM revealed three main categories: knowledge, patient characteristics and HCP-patient interactions. Availability of information was a commonly reported facilitator of SDM, while poor HCP-patient engagement was a commonly reported barrier. Tools varied in focus, with some facilitating general treatment SDM while others supported selection of certain therapy types. The studies underscored additional factors critical for SDM, such as alignment of HCP-patient perceptions, shared language and tailoring of tools to specific subpopulations. Few studies report on treatment SDM factors and tools in haemophilia; available tools vary considerably. It remains unclear whether published tools have been successfully implemented into clinical practice. Additional research is warranted."

    "abstract": "Coagulation factor replacement therapy for the X-linked bleeding disorder Haemophilia, characterized by a deficiency of coagulation protein factor VIII (FVIII), is severely complicated by antibody (inhibitors) formation. The development of FVIII inhibitors drastically alters the quality of life of the patients and is associated with a tremendous increase in morbidity as well as treatment costs. The ultimate goal of inhibitor control is antibody elimination. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the only clinically established approach for developing antigen-specific tolerance to FVIII. This work aims to establish a novel cost-effective strategy to produce FVIII molecules in fusion with cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit at the N terminus using the Bacillus subtilis expression system for oral tolerance, as the current clinical immune tolerance protocols are expensive. Regions of B-Domain Deleted (BDD)-FVIII that have potential epitopes were identified by employing Bepipred linear epitope prediction; 2 or more epitopes in each domain were combined and cDNA encoding these regions were fused with CTB and cloned in the Bacillus subtilis expression vector pHT43 and expression analysis was carried out. The expressed CTB-fused FVIII epitope domains showed strong binding affinity towards the CTB-receptor GM1 ganglioside. To conclude, Bacillus subtilis expressing FVIII molecules might be a promising candidate for exploring for the induction of oral immune tolerance."

All five patients completed 12 cycles of treatment. SAEs were not observed. The most common AEs were fever (60%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea: 20%, enterocolitis: 20%). Improvements in LSM and serum albumin levels were also observed. In this preliminary assessment, intravenous administration of 140 or 280 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/4 hours OP-724 over 12 weeks was well tolerated by patients with haemophilia combined with cirrhosis due to HIV/HCV coinfection.

Previous study demonstrated a weak binding affinity between emicizumab and factor (F)X (<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub>; 1.85 μM), and that this value was much greater than the plasma FX concentration (∼130 nM). We speculated that increased FX levels could enhance coagulation potential in emicizumab-treated patients with hemophilia A (PwHA). To investigate the relationship between FX concentrations and emicizumab-driven coagulation. Plasma FX (up to 1,040 nM) and emicizumab (50 µg/mL) were added to FVIII-deficient plasmas, and plasma-derived FX (520 nM) or recombinant (r)FVIIa (2.2 µg/mL) was added to plasmas from three emicizumab-treated PwHAwI. The adjusted maximum coagulation velocity (Ad|min1|) by clot waveform analysis and peak thrombin (PeakTh) by thrombin generation assay in them were evaluated. Emicizumab (3.0 mg/kg), human (h)FIX (100 IU/kg), and various doses of hFX (100-500 IU/kg) were intravenously administered to HA mice. Clotting time/clot formation time (CT/CFT) were assessed using rotational thromboelastometry, and blood loss was estimated by a tail-clip assay. The addition of FX to FVIII-deficient plasma with emicizumab increased Ad|min1| and PeakTh. The coagulation parameters in emicizumab-treated PwHAwI spiked with additional FX remained within the normal range as well as the additional rFVIIa. In animal models, hFX injection shortened the CT and CT + CFT. The shorter CT and CT + CFT, and the lower blood loss were evident after 200 or 500 IU/kg hFX administration, and those indices were comparable to those in wild-type mice.

We established four immunological methods to detect immune epitopes of the AAV2-derived peptides, including a Bab assay, Nab assay, B cell receptor (BCR) detecting assay, and immunoglobin-producing B cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (B cell ELISpot) assay. Correlations among the epitopes determined by these four methods were analyzed using the serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 89 patients with hemophilia A/B. As decoys, the peptides' ability to block the Nab of AAV2 particles was assessed using AAV transduction models both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Overall, we provide insights into AAV2-capsid-derived peptide immune epitopes, involving the Nab, Bab, BCR, and B cell ELISpot assays, offering alternative immunological evaluation approaches and strategies to overcome Nab barriers in AAV-mediated gene therapy."

    "title": "Tachyphylaxis and reproducibility of desmopressin response in perioperative persons with nonsevere hemophilia A: implications for clinical practice.",
    "abstract": "Desmopressin is frequently used perioperatively in persons with nonsevere hemophilia A. However, increase in factor (F)VIII:C after desmopressin use is interindividually highly variable. Tachyphylaxis has only been reported in test setting for persons with hemophilia A, with a remaining response of approximately 70% after a second dose compared with that after a first dose. To study tachyphylaxis of FVIII:C response after multiple administration(s) of desmopressin in perioperative persons with nonsevere hemophilia A. We studied FVIII:C levels after desmopressin before (day 0 [D0]) and on days 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) after surgery in 26 patients of the DAVID and Little DAVID studies. We studied tachyphylaxis by comparing the responses at D1 and D2 with that at D0. We also assessed the reproducibility of the D0 response in comparison to an earlier performed desmopressin test. The median absolute FVIII:C increase was 0.50 IU/mL (0.35-0.74; <i>n</i> = 23) at D0, 0.21 IU/mL (0.14-0.28; <i>n</i> = 17) at D1, and 0.23 IU/mL (0.16-0.30; <i>n</i> = 11) at D2. The median percentage of FVIII increase after the second administration (D1) compared with the first (D0) was 42.9% (29.2%-52.5%; <i>n</i> = 17) and that of the third (D2) compared with the first (D0) was 36.4% (23.7%-46.9%; <i>n</i> = 11). The FVIII:C desmopressin response at D0 was comparable with the desmopressin test response in 74% of the patients. Tachyphylaxis in the surgical setting was considerably more pronounced than previously reported, with FVIII:C at D1 and D2 of 36% to 43% of the initial response. Our results may have important implications for monitoring repeated desmopressin treatment when used perioperatively."

    "abstract": "Hemophilic arthropathy usually affects the knees bilaterally. In order to reduce costs and improve rehabilitation, bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be performed. However, pharmacological prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) remains controversial in patients with severe hemophilia. The purpose of this study was to establish the incidence of DVT in severe hemophilia A patients undergoing bilateral simultaneous TKA without pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Consecutive patients with severe hemophilia A undergoing bilateral simultaneous TKA at a single center between January 2015 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received a modified coagulation factor substitution regimen. Tranexamic acid (TXA) was used for hemostasis in all patients during surgery. All patients followed a standardized postoperative protocol with routine mechanical thromboprophylaxis, and none received anticoagulation. D-dimer was measured preoperatively, on the day of the operation and on postoperative days 1, 7 and 14. Ultrasound (US) of the lower extremities was performed before (within 3 days of hospitalization) and after surgery (days 3 and 14) to detect asymptomatic DVT. Patients were followed up until 2 years after surgery for the development of symptomatic DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). 38 male patients with severe hemophilia A underwent 76 simultaneous TKAs. Mean (± standard deviation) age at the time of operation was 41.7 (± 17.1) years. Overall, 47.3% of patients had D-dimer concentrations above the threshold 10 µg/mL on day 7 and 39.5% on day 14. However, none of the patients had DVT detected on postoperative US, nor developed symptomatic DVT or PE during the 2-year follow-up. The risk of DVT in patients with severe hemophilia A after bilateral simultaneous TKA is relatively low, and routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis may not be needed."

    "abstract": "Recombinant Factor VIII-Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) is an enhanced half-life therapeutic protein product used for the management of hemophilia A. Recent studies have demonstrated that rFVIIIFc interacts with Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) resulting in the activation or inhibition of various FcγR-expressing immune cells. We previously demonstrated that rFVIIIFc, unlike recombinant Factor IX-Fc (rFIXFc), activates natural killer (NK) cells via Fc-mediated interactions with FcγRIIIA (CD16). Additionally, we showed that rFVIIIFc activated CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells to lyse a FVIII-specific B cell clone. Here, we used human NK cell lines and primary NK cells enriched from peripheral blood leukocytes to study the role of the FVIII moiety in rFVIIIFc-mediated NK cell activation. Following overnight incubation of NK cells with rFVIIIFc, cellular activation was assessed by measuring secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IFNγ by ELISA or by cellular degranulation. We show that anti-FVIII, anti-Fc, and anti-CD16 all inhibited indicating that these molecules were involved in rFVIIIFc-mediated NK cell activation. To define which domains of FVIII were involved, we used antibodies that are FVIII domain-specific and demonstrated that blocking FVIII C1 or C2 domain-mediated membrane binding potently inhibited rFVIIIFc-mediated CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cell activation, while targeting the FVIII heavy chain domains did not. We also show that rFVIIIFc binds CD16 with about five-fold higher affinity than rFIXFc. Based on our results we propose that FVIII light chain-mediated membrane binding results in tethering of the fusion protein to the cell surface, and this, together with increased binding affinity for CD16, allows for Fc-CD16 interactions to proceed, resulting in NK cellular activation. Our working model may explain our previous results where we observed that rFVIIIFc activated NK cells via CD16, whereas rFIXFc did not despite having identical IgG1 Fc domains."

The patient was diagnosed with hemophilia A and unfortunately contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from blood products. He subsequently developed progressive splenomegaly due to portal hypertension from chronic HCV, resulting in severe thrombocytopenia. PSE was performed because he had occasional subcutaneous bleeding and needed to start interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) treatment for curing his HCV infection at that time. His platelet counts increased, and no serious adverse events were observed. Currently, he continues to receive outpatient treatment, regular factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy for hemophilia A, and antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. Vascular embolization has been reported to be an effective and minimally invasive treatment for bleeding in hemophilia patients. PSE also provided him with a stable quality of life without the side effects of serious infections and thrombocytopenia relapses. We conclude that PSE is a promising therapeutic option for patients with hemophilia A."

To compare free TFPI (fTFPI) levels in patients with severe haemophilia A (sHA) and severe haemophilia B (sHB) and to investigate in these patients as a whole the relationships between bleeding and TG potential, between TG potential and fTFPI level and between fTFPI level and bleeding tendency. Data on bleeding episodes retrospectively recorded during follow-up visits over 5-10 years were collected and used to calculate the annualised joint bleeding rate (AJBR). fTFPI levels and basal TG parameters were determined in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) using calibrated automated tomography (CAT). Mean fTFPI levels did not differ significantly between sHA (n = 34) and sHB (n = 19) patients. Mean values of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and thrombin peak (peak) in PPP and PRP were two-fold higher when fTFPI levels < 9.4 versus > 14.3 ng/mL. In patients treated on demand, ETP and peak in PRP were doubled when AJBR was <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mo>≤</mo> <mn>4.9</mn></mrow> <annotation>$ \\le 4.9$</annotation></semantics> </math> , AJBR being halved in patients with a low fTFPI level (9.4 ng/mL). In patients on factor prophylaxis, no association was found between TG parameters and either fTFPI level or AJBR. In patients treated on demand, bleeding tendency was influenced by fTFPI levels, which in turn affected basal TG potential. In patients on prophylaxis, bleeding tendency is probably determined primarily by the intensity of this treatment."

    "abstract": "Currently, the most important treatment approach for hemophilia type A is recombinant Factor VIII. However, due to its low retention time in the blood, the patients usually need successive injections. In addition, neutralization of injected proteins by antibodies complicates treatment. We examined the prolongation of the persistence time of injectable FVIII in the blood and the potential effects on survival using promising PEGylated liposomes (PEGLip) utilizing hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC, Tm= 54.5 ºC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC, Tm= - 2 ºC). Nanoliposomes with different percentages of PEG (3% and 5%) were obtained via the thin film hydration procedure and extrusion. Liposomal FVIII formulation was prepared and characterization was done. The results revealed that the formulations are in the 80-120 nm range with uniform dispersion, which was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. The phase transition temperature (Tm) of the liposomes was obtained by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). With an attachment efficacy of approximately 87%, proteins bind non-covalently yet with a strong affinity to the exterior of PEGLip. The final formulations underwent additional examination. No significant change was observed in size, charge, and PDI between the FVIII-conjugated liposomal formulations and their liposomal nanoparticles. The selected formulations were injected into BALB/c mice. The circulation time and potential clotting effectiveness of PEGLip-FVIII are vastly improved over free protein, in non-hemophilic mice. The obtained results showed that using phospholipids with high Tm (HSPC) can improve the hemostatic efficiency of liposomes more than phospholipids with low Tm (POPC)."

    "abstract": "The most notable challenge facing hemophilia A treatment is the development of inhibitors against factor VIII, resulting in increased clinical and socioeconomic burdens due to the need for expensive bypassing agents (BPAs). Although immune tolerance induction (ITI) is currently the primary approach for inhibiting and reducing the inhibitors, the lengthy duration of ITI necessitates the continued use of BPA to manage bleeding episodes. In this study, we aimed to obtain real-world evidence on the clinical and economic aspects and associated burdens experienced by patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors undergoing ITI in Korea. Claims data from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2020, were used in this study. The study cohort comprised patients with hemophilia A undergoing ITI, who were categorized into three groups: successful, failed, or continuation of ITI. We evaluated clinical and economic burdens, including monthly healthcare visits, medication costs, and total medical expenses. The study involved 33 cases of ITI across 32 patients. Excluding seven continuation cases where success could not be determined at the observation point, the estimated success rate of ITI was 80.8 %. The median duration of ITI for all patients was 25.7 months. While no significant disparities were noted in the ITI duration between successful and unsuccessful cases (24.51 vs. 25.66 months), substantial discrepancies were observed in the duration of BPA usage (11.10 vs. 25.66 months) and the number of prescribed BPAs (1.79 vs. 2.97). Successful ITI reduced both clinical and economic burdens, resulting in decreased monthly medication expenses and overall medical costs."

    "abstract": "Management of patients with hemophilia A (HA) requires the knowledge and experience of specialized health care professionals. However, these patients may need to be attended in emergencies, outside the referral hospital, where health care professionals do not know about hemophilia and/or new innovative treatments. This study aimed to develop a simple and practical algorithm that could be used in emergency situations by nonspecialized treaters in HA and bleeding with or without factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors under emicizumab prophylaxis. A group of experts agreed on a simple algorithm, easy to operate, adapted from previous international guidelines, and based on their clinical experience. The proposed algorithm starts with identifying the patient, confirming the diagnosis of HA, prophylaxis with emicizumab, and/or use of other treatments. After stabilizing the patient and stratifying the bleeding risk, the patient is managed according to the presence/absence of FVIII inhibitors. Patients without FVIII inhibitors should receive FVIII concentrate. Dose and follow-up depend on bleeding localization and severity. Patients with FVIII inhibitors should preferably receive recombinant activated factor VII as bypass agent. A basic coagulation assay, FVIII assessment, and FVIII inhibitors detection assays are necessary in an emergency. However, these tests should be interpreted with caution and appropriately chosen, as emicizumab may alter the results. The management of patients with HA is challenging in emergency situations, especially if they are treated with new agents. Nonspecialized in coagulopathies health care professionals have limited understanding of the disease, highlighting the need for an algorithm to assist them in making informed decisions."

However, cases presumed to be sporadic due to family history may not always be sporadic. Few case reports have been published on mosaicism in haemophilia B. The present study aimed to trace the origin of the pathogenic variant in a well-defined cohort of sporadic cases of haemophilia B by haplotyping markers. It also aimed to determine the frequency of mosaicism in presumed non-carrier mothers. The study group was 40 families, each with a sporadic case of haemophilia B analysed in two-to-three generations by Sanger sequencing, haplotyping and using the sensitive droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technique. In 31/40 (78%) of the families, the mother carried the same pathogenic variant as her son, while Sanger sequencing showed that 9/40 (22%) of the mothers did not carry this variant. Of these variants, 2/9 (22%) were shown to be mosaics by using the ddPCR technique. 16/21 carrier mothers, with samples from three generations available, had a de novo pathogenic variant of which 14 derived from the healthy maternal grandfather. The origin of the pathogenic variant in sporadic cases of haemophilia B is most often found in the X-chromosome derived from the maternal grandfather or, less often, from the maternal grandmother. Mosaic females seem to be found at the same frequency as in haemophilia A but at a lower percentage of the pathogenic variant."

    "abstract": "Blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease, and other clinical conditions are often accompanied by intravascular hemolytic events along with the development of severe coagulopathies. Hemolysis, in turn, leads to the accumulation of Fe(II/III)-protoporphyrin IX (heme) in the intravascular compartment, which can trigger a variety of proinflammatory and prothrombotic reactions. As such, heme binding to the blood coagulation proteins factor VIII (FVIII), fibrinogen, and activated protein C with functional consequences has been demonstrated earlier. We herein present an in-depth characterization of the FVIII-heme interaction at the molecular level and its (patho-)physiological relevance through the application of biochemical, biophysical, structural biology, bioinformatic, and diagnostic tools. FVIII has a great heme-binding capacity with seven heme molecules associating with the protein. The respective binding sites were identified by investigating heme binding to FVIII-derived peptides in combination with molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies of the complex as well as cryo-electron microscopy, revealing three high-affinity and four moderate heme-binding motifs (HBMs). Furthermore, the relevance of the FVIII-heme complex formation was characterized in physiologically relevant assay systems, revealing a ~ 50 % inhibition of the FVIII cofactor activity even in the protein-rich environment of blood plasma. Our study provides not only novel molecular insights into the FVIII-heme interaction and its physiological relevance, but also strongly suggests the reduction of the intrinsic pathway and the accentuation of the final clotting step (by, for example, fibrinogen crosslinking) in hemolytic conditions as well as a future perspective in the context of FVIII substitution therapy of hemorrhagic events in hemophilia A patients."

Participants with FVIII inhibitors, mild HA, or HB were excluded from this analysis, plus those aged 18 to 19 years. Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs), target joints, and other patient-reported outcomes were evaluated. <b>Results</b> Overall, 468 and 691 PwHA with available data for the outcomes of interest were stratified by hemophilia severity and treatment regimen in CHESS II and CHESS PAEDs, respectively. In these studies, 173 (37.0%) and 468 (67.7%) participants received FVIII prophylaxis, respectively; no participants received the FVIII mimetic emicizumab or gene therapy.

As the severity of HA subtypes increased, the levels of |Min1|, |Min2|, and |Max2| progressively decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that |Max2| and |Min2| were more effective than |Min1| in distinguishing different types of HA patients, with higher diagnostic efficacy. The standard curves based on Actin FSL reagent for normal and low levels of FVIII:C-|Max2| were established, with R2 values of 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. These curves can be utilized for monitoring during replacement therapies involving full-length recombinant FVIII and B-domain-deleted FVIII.

The study's aim was to clarify the roles of kinesiophobia and self-efficacy in the relationship between pain catastrophizing and PA in PWH. This cross-sectional study included adult PWH at the Haemophilia Centre of a Tertiary hospital in Beijing, China. The following questionnaires were used to collect data: the general information, the International Physical Activity Short Questionnaire, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia Scale, and the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale. The study included a total of 187 PWH, including 154 having haemophilia A and 33 having haemophilia B. The median interquartile range of PA was 594 (198, 1554) MET-min/wk. There were significant differences in PA of patients based on age stage, treatment modality, highest pain score within the last seven days, and presence of haemophilic arthropathy (p < .05). It was showed that pain catastrophizing could directly predict PA (p < .001), accounting for 38.13% of the total effect. Pain catastrophizing also had indirect effects on PA through the mediating factors of kinesiophobia or self-efficacy, and through the chain-mediating effect of kinesiophobia and self-efficacy, accounting for 38.40%, 17.07%, and 6.40%, respectively. The study discovered that PWH have limited PA due to pain catastrophizing. This not only directly affects their activity but also indirectly influences it through kinesiophobia and self-efficacy."

    "abstract": "A prospective, non-interventional study (270-902) followed 294 adults with severe hemophilia A (SHA) receiving prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII). From these participants, 112 rolled over into a single-arm, multicenter, phase 3 trial (GENEr8-1; NCT03370913) that evaluated efficacy and safety of valoctocogene roxaparvovec, a gene therapy that provides endogenous FVIII in individuals with SHA. Participants from 270-902 who did not roll over provide an opportunity for a contemporaneous external control. Therefore, the comparative effectiveness of valoctocogene roxaparvovec vs FVIII prophylaxis was evaluated using propensity scoring (PS). This post hoc analysis compared 112 participants from GENEr8-1 (treated cohort) to 73 participants in 270-902 who did not enroll in GENEr8-1 (control cohort). The primary analysis used standardized mortality ratio weighting to re-weight baseline characteristics of the control cohort to better match the treated cohort. Mean annualized bleeding rates (ABR) for treated and all bleeds were compared between cohorts along with the proportion of participants with zero bleeds (treated and all bleeds). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were also conducted. PS adjustments reduced differences in baseline characteristics between cohorts. Mean treated (4.40 vs 0.85; P < 0.001) and all (5.01 vs 1.54; P < 0.001) ABR were significantly lower, and the proportions of participants with zero treated bleeds (82.1% vs 32.9%; P < 0.001) and all bleeds (58.0% vs 28.5%; P < 0.001) were significantly higher in GENEr8-1. PS-adjusted analyses were consistent with prior intra-individual comparisons. Compared with participants receiving prophylactic FVIII, the participants receiving valoctocogene roxaparvovec experienced lower ABR, and a higher proportion had zero bleeds.

    "title": "Epidemiology, patient journey and unmet needs related to hemophilia in Brazil: a scoping review with evidence map.",
    "abstract": "Brazil is one of the countries with the largest population of people with hemophilia (PwH) worldwide. In this scoping review, we aim to investigate the Brazilian context for hemophilia regarding three predefined concepts: (i) clinical-epidemiological profile, (ii) burden of disease and (iii) patient journey and unmet needs. Three questions in each concept guided the screening of references retrieved by systematic searches carried out in MEDLINE, LILACS and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. Quantitative and qualitative studies conducted in Brazil from 2002 onwards were assessed for eligibility. Ninety-two studies were included. A total of 66 studies addressed the concept \"Clinical-epidemiological profile\", 31 investigated the concept of \"Burden of disease\" and 26 addressed the concept \"Patient journey and unmet needs\". Based on these studies, pain and arthropathy affect a substantial proportion of the PwH, with physical functioning, pain and school or work being the domains of quality of life with the greatest impact. About 43 % to 82.6 % of the PwH are unemployed. Rates of inhibitor development are highly variable across studies, especially in hemophilia A. Adherence to prophylactic treatment ranges from 25 % to 72 %. The annualized bleeding rate is estimated at 2.4 ± 4.1. The barriers to treatment identified include distance to reference centers, lack of coordination of specialized and emergency care and restricted access to rehabilitation. Hemophilia poses a considerable burden on the PwH. Despite the available modalities of treatment, there are remaining unmet needs that should be addressed by researchers and policy makers in the future."

To present 3-year efficacy and safety in the multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 3 GENEr8-1 trial. GENEr8-1 enrolled 134 adult males with severe hemophilia A who were receiving FVIII prophylaxis. Efficacy endpoints included annualized bleeding rate, annualized FVIII utilization, FVIII activity (chromogenic substrate assay; imputed as 1 IU/dL at baseline and 0 IU/dL after discontinuation), and the Haemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults. Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs). At week 156, 131 of 134 participants remained in the study; overall, 17 of 134 resumed prophylaxis. Mean annualized bleeding rate for treated bleeds decreased from 4.8 (SD, 6.5) bleeds/y at baseline to 0.8 (SD, 2.3; P < .0001) bleeds/y after prophylaxis (prophylaxis cessation to last follow-up) and 0.97 (SD, 3.48) bleeds/y during year 3. Annualized FVIII utilization decreased 96.8% from baseline after prophylaxis and 94.2% during year 3. At week 156, mean and median FVIII activity were 18.4 (SD, 30.8) and 8.3 IU/dL, respectively. FVIII activity decrease was lower between years 2 and 3 than between years 1 and 2. At the end of year 3, clinically meaningful improvements in the Haemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults Total Score were observed (mean change from baseline, 6.6; 95% CI, 4.24-8.87; P < .0001). Mild alanine aminotransferase elevations remained the most common AE during year 3 (23.7% of participants). A serious AE of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was considered unrelated to treatment. Hemostatic efficacy was maintained, and safety remained unchanged from previous years."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is a common X-linked recessive hereditary bleeding disorder. Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is insufficient in patients with HA due to the mutations in the <i>F8</i> gene. The restoration of plasma levels of FVIII via both recombinant B-domain-deleted FVIII (BDD-FVIII) and B-domain-deleted <i>F8</i> (<i>BDDF8</i>) transgenes was proven to be helpful. FVIII-Padua is a 23.4 kb tandem repeat mutation in the <i>F8</i> associated with a high <i>F8</i> gene expression and thrombogenesis. Here we screened a core enhancer element in FVIII-Padua for improving the <i>F8</i> expression. In detail, we identified a 400 bp efficient enhancer element, C400, in FVIII-Padua for the first time. The core enhancer C400 extensively improved the transcription of <i>BDDF8</i> driven by human elongation factor-1 alpha in HepG2, HeLa, HEK-293T and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with different genetic backgrounds, as well as iPSCs-derived endothelial progenitor cells (iEPCs) and iPSCs-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs). The expression of FVIII protein was increased by C400, especially in iEPCs. Our research provides a novel molecular target to enhance expression of FVIII protein, which has scientific value and application prospects in both viral and nonviral HA gene therapy strategies."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has long been recognized as a complication in people with chronic liver disease, particularly those with cirrhosis. Two gene therapies for haemophilia A and B recently approved in Europe and the US utilize adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors designed to target hepatocytes. A number of other AAV gene therapies are undergoing clinical investigation for both liver and extrahepatic diseases, many of which likely transduce hepatocytes as well. Although AAV vectors predominantly persist in episomal forms, concerns about insertional mutagenesis have arisen due to findings in pre-clinical models and in a small subset of human HCC cases featuring wild-type AAV integrations in proximity to potential oncogenes. Despite the absence of any causative link between AAV vector therapy and HCC in approved extrahepatic gene therapies or haemophilia gene therapy trials, the package inserts for the recently approved haemophilia gene therapies advise HCC screening in subsets of individuals with additional risk factors. In this review, we discuss HCC risk factors, compare various screening modalities, discuss optimal screening intervals, and consider when to initiate and possibly discontinue screening. At this early point in the evolution of gene therapy, we lack sufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations on HCC screening. While AAV vectors may eventually be shown to be unassociated with risk of HCC, we presently favour a cautious approach that entails regular surveillance until such time as it is hopefully proven to be unnecessary."

    "abstract": "Hepatitis is a common adverse event following gene therapy for haemophilia, often associated with a loss of transgene expression. Investigating the potential causes and implications of this is crucial for the overall success of treatment. Gene therapy trials using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have demonstrated promising results marked by increases in factor FVIII and FIX levels and reductions in episodes of bleeding. However, hepatocellular injury characterised by elevations in alanine aminotransferases (ALT) has been noted. This liver injury is typically transient and asymptomatic, posing challenges in determining its clinical significance. Proposed causes encompass immune-mediated responses, notably T cell cytotoxicity in response to the AAV vector, direct liver injury from the viral capsid or transcribed protein via the unfolded protein response and pre-existing liver conditions. Liver biopsy data conducted years post-gene therapy infusion has shown sinusoidal infiltration without significant inflammation. The overall safety profile of gene therapy remains favourable with no evidence drug-induced liver injury (DILI) based on Hy's Law criteria. Essential pre-therapy monitoring and identifying patients at high risk of liver injury should involve liver function tests and non-invasive fibroscans, while novel blood-based biomarkers are under exploration. Further research is required to comprehend the mechanisms underlying transaminitis, loss of transgene expression and long-term effects on the liver, providing insights for optimising gene therapy for haemophilia."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder which causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the severe form. Prophylaxis with factor replacement has high efficacy in reducing bleeding but is limited by the need for frequent intravenous infusion and fluctuations in haemostasis between doses. Additional prophylaxis therapies are being developed which may overcome some of the current treatment barriers. Gene therapy (GT) is being developed to provide a functional cure such that there is sustained factor expression and minimal to no need for additional haemostatic therapy. There are now two approved gene therapies for haemophilia which may be transformative for many individuals. Benefits of GT should go beyond increasing factor activity and reducing bleeding as persons with haemophilia aim to achieve a 'haemophilia-free mind' and health equity with optimal health and well-being."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for haemophilia, utilizing adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) and coagulation factor genes, have demonstrated promising results, leading to recent approvals and introduction of the first gene therapy products into clinical practice. For successful and safe use, there are predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the treatment process and associated risks should be thoroughly understood and long-term safety and efficacy carefully evaluated during follow up. As gene therapy becomes more accessible outside of clinical study centers, continuous evaluation of patient eligibility for subsequent AAV-based treatments becomes essential. Thorough evaluation of factors such as liver condition, anti-AAV status, and medical history ensures that gene therapy maximizing benefits while minimizing risks. Apart from fulfilling the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, the success of gene therapy is greatly influenced by the motivation and willingness of patients to accept temporary constraints, such as regular laboratory monitoring, potential use of immunosuppressants, and thorough documentation. Furthermore, various patient-related factors play a significant role in the management and outcomes of gene therapy, making a comprehensive evaluation essential. With the accumulation of more data, there is potential for the expansion of certain inclusion criteria, which may allow for a larger number of eligible patients to benefit from gene therapy. Empowering patients through shared decision-making enables them to thoroughly consider the therapy's potential benefits and risks."

The immune responses include adaptive and innate pathways as well as cytokine mediated inflammation, especially of the target organ cells-hepatocytes. Immune suppression has only been partly effective in clinical trials at ameliorating the immune response and the lack of good animal models has delayed progress in identifying mechanisms and developing more effective approaches to controlling these effects of AAV gene transfer. Here we discuss the arguments for and against more potent immunosuppression to improve factor expression after AAV-mediated gene therapy."

The evolving treatment paradigms targeting higher trough levels and the advent of non-factor replacement therapies (NFRT) means much of the 'protection' PWH were thought to have against CVD may be lost. There is a paucity of evidence regarding the safety of using anticoagulants in PWH. We designed a study assessing the thrombin generation (TG) of PWH of different severities and treatments, compared to non-haemophilia patients receiving a Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor (apixaban or rivaroxaban), healthy controls, and assessing TG parameters of adding FXa inhibitor to the plasma of PWH receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. In total, 40 patients were included. TG was initiated with 5pM tissue factor (TF) using the calibrated automated thrombinoscope. Compared to those with mild haemophilia, patients receiving a FXa inhibitor had higher endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) (1278.42 vs 1831.36) and velocity index (40.71 vs 112.56), but both had a similar peak height (154.0 vs 262.63) and time to peak (both 5.83). People with severe haemophilia receiving emicizumab had significantly improved TG parameters compared to those not receiving emicizumab - ETP 1678.11 vs 809.96 and peak height 233.8 vs 92.05; however, when FXa inhibitor was added their TG parameters deteriorated to the severe haemophilia range (ETP 1179.60 and peak height 103.05).

    "abstract": "Patients with haemophilia (PwH) suffer from chronic pain due to joint alterations induced by recurring haemorrhage. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between structural alterations and pain perception at the ankle joint in PwH. Ankle joints of 79 PwH and 57 healthy controls (Con) underwent ultrasound examination (US) and assessment of pain sensitivity via pressure pain thresholds (PPT). US discriminated between joint activity (synovitis) and joint damage (cartilage and/or bone degeneration) applying the HEAD-US protocol. Based on US-findings, five subgroups were built: PwH with activity/damage, PwH with activity/no damage, PwH with no activity/no damage, controls with activity/no damage and controls with no activity/no damage. Joint activity and joint damage were significantly increased in ankles of PwH compared to Con (p ≤.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that structural alterations negatively impact pain perception. This is particularly evident when comparing PwH with both activity/damage to PwH with no activity/no damage at the tibiotalar joint (p = .001). At the fibulotalar joint, no significant differences were observed between PwH subgroups. Further analysis showed that both joint activity and joint damage result in an increase in pain sensitivity (p ≤.001). The data suggest a relation between joint activity, joint damage and pain perception in PwH. Even minor changes due to synovitis appear to affect pain perception, with the effect not intensifying at higher levels of inflammation. In terms of joint damage, severe degeneration leads to a sensitised pain state most robustly, whereas initial changes do not seem to significantly affect pain perception."

We evaluated the periodontal and bone status in such patients. Material and methods: Forty-eight patients with severe type A/B hemophilia and 49 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Assessments included simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S), calculus index, debris index, gingival index (GI), gingival bleeding time index (GBTI), and decayed, missing, and filled teeth index (DMFTI). Bone resorption was evaluated using panoramic mandibular index (PMI), mental index (MI), and alveolar crest ratio (ACR). Mineral density in the condyle, angulus, and premolar areas was assessed using fractal analysis, with fractal dimensions denoted as condyle fractal dimension (CFD) for the condyle, angulus fractal dimension (AFD) for angulus, and premolar fractal dimension (PFD) for premolar region. The mean scores were DMFTI = 11.77, OHI-S = 2.44, PMI = 0.268, MI = 5.822, GI = 3.02, GBTI = 2.64, ACR = 2.06, CFD = 1.31, AFD = 1.31, and PFD = 1.17 in the hemophilia group and DMFTI = 11.449, PMI = 0.494, MI = 7.43, GI = 0.67, GBTI = 0.98, OHI-S = 1.45, ACR = 2.87, CFD = 1.35, AFD = 1.35, and PDF = 1.23 in the control group.

HHT causes serious mucosal bleeding resulting in severe iron-deficiency anemia, major psychosocial complications, and visceral arteriovenous malformations in the brain, lung, and liver, which can cause life-threatening hemorrhagic complications. No study has examined the relative morbidity of HHT and von Willebrand disease (VWD), which is the most common inherited BD in women. We performed an observational cohort study of women with HHT or VWD, comparing a representative sample of 100 randomly selected women with HHT to 100 randomly selected age-matched women with VWD. In HHT vs VWD, recurrent epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding were more likely (odds ratio [OR], 32.73 [95% confidence interval, 13.81-71.80]; P < .0001 and 5.69 [2.59-12.89]; P < .0001) and heavy menstrual bleeding was less likely (OR, 0.32 [0.18-0.57]; P < .0001). Iron-deficiency anemia was significantly more likely, and the lowest hemoglobin was significantly lower in HHT than in VWD. The odds of iron infusion dependence, requirement for red cell transfusion, and hemostatic surgical procedures were significantly higher-17-fold, threefold, and eightfold higher, respectively-and hospital admissions to manage disease complications were both ∼14 times more frequent in women with HHT vs those with VWD. In conclusion, much higher disease-related morbidity, mortality, and health care use were observed in women with HHT vs VWD, providing evidence that HHT may be the most clinically significant inherited BD in women. Given the vast gap in research funding for HHT compared with both hemophilia (a disease primarily of men) and VWD, these findings have significant implications for gender equity in hematology."

The population consisted of 122 previously untreated patients with severe HA who were followed up for 50 days of exposure to FVIII or 3 years, whichever occurred first. Sampling was performed before FVIII treatment and at the end of the follow-up. The outcome was inhibitor development. The FVIII epitope repertoire was assessed by means of a novel random peptide phage-display assay. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model and a random forest model were fitted on posttreatment sample data and validated in pretreatment sample data. The predictive performance of these models was assessed by the C-statistic and a calibration plot. We identified 27 775 peptides putatively directed against FVIII, which were used as input for the statistical models. The C-statistic of the LASSO and random forest models were good at 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.86) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89). Model calibration of both models was moderately good. Two statistical models, developed on data from a novel random peptide phage display assay, were used to predict inhibitor development before exposure to exogenous FVIII. These models can be used to set up diagnostic tests that predict the risk of inhibitor development before starting treatment with FVIII."

This study aims to explore pain sensitivity in PwH methodologically investigating in cuff pressure testing compared to algometer testing. 37 PwH and 35 healthy control subjects (Con) enrolled in this study. Joint health status was assessed. Subjective pain was evaluated using numeric rating scales. Pain sensitivity was measured with pressure algometry and cuff pressure algometry. Pressure pain thresholds of the algometer (PPT<sub>a</sub>) were measured at knee, ankle joints, and forehead. Subsequently, thresholds of cuff pressure were measured at the left and right lower legs (PPT<sub>cuff</sub>). In both, lower values represent higher pain sensitivity. PwH exerted a worse joint health status than Con. Pain sensitivity was higher in PwH compared to Con as PPT<sub>a</sub> of the knee and ankle joints were lower in PwH. No difference was observed in PPT<sub>a</sub> at the forehead. Contrastingly, lower pain sensitivity was detected in PwH by higher PPT<sub>cuff</sub> values compared to Con in both legs. While PPT<sub>a</sub> of the knee and ankle joints are lower in PwH, PPT<sub>cuff</sub> are higher in PwH compared to Con. This reveals a paradox situation, highlighting that PwH experience local, joint- and hemophilic arthropathy-related pain, whereas pain sensitivity of non-affected soft tissue structures is lower. The reasons explaining the PPT<sub>cuff</sub> results remain elusive but might be explained by coping strategies counteracting chronic joint pain, resulting in lower sensitivity at non-affected structures."

This review summarizes the nonclinical studies and clinical development that supported regulatory clearance. Similar to other gene therapies for single gene disorders, both the short-term safety and the phenotypic improvement were unequivocal, justifying the modest-sized safety and efficacy database, which included 57 participants across the phase 2b (3 participants) and phase 3 (54 participants) studies. The most common adverse reactions included liver enzyme elevation, headache, flu-like symptoms, infusion-related reactions, creatine kinase elevation, malaise, and fatigue; these were mostly transient. One participant had hepatocellular carcinoma on a study-mandated liver ultrasound conducted 1 year after vector infusion; molecular analysis of the resected tumor showed no evidence of vector-related insertional mutagenesis as the etiology. A remarkable 96% of participants in the phase 3 trial were able to stop factor IX (FIX) prophylaxis, with the study demonstrating noninferiority to FIX prophylaxis in terms of the primary end point, annualized bleeding rate. Key secondary end points such as the annualized infusion rate, which declined by 97%, and the plasma FIX activity level at 18 months after infusion, with least squares mean increase of 34.3 percentage points compared with baseline, were both clinically and statistically significant. The FDA's landmark approval of Hemgenix as a pioneering treatment for hemophilia stands on the shoulders of >20 years of gene therapy clinical research and heralds a promising future for genomic medicines."

Several decades of preclinical and clinical trials have led to development of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene transfer for endogenous production of factor VIII (FVIII) in hemophilia A (HA). Only one gene therapy product for HA (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) has been approved by regulatory authorities. Results of valoctocogene roxaparvovec trial show significant improvement in bleeding rates and use of factor replacement therapy; however, sustainability and duration of response show variability with overall decline in FVIII expression over time. Further challenges include untoward adverse effects involving liver toxicity requiring immunosuppression and development of neutralizing antibodies to AAV vector rendering future doses ineffective. Real-life applicability of gene therapy for HA will require appropriate patient screening, infrastructure setup, long-term monitoring including data collection of patient-reported outcomes and innovative payment schemes. This review article highlights the success and development of HA gene therapy trials, challenges including adverse outcomes and variability of response, and perspectives on approach to gene therapy including shared decision-making and need for future strategies to overcome the several unmet needs."

However, spontaneous and trauma-induced breakthrough bleeds have been reported in patients on emicizumab prophylaxis, and no laboratory assay has been validated to evaluate the hemostatic activity of emicizumab. The thrombin generation assay (TGA) could be a surrogate marker of the hemostatic efficacy of emicizumab. The correlation between TGA and the methods used to measure emicizumab blood concentration was evaluated in this study. TGA was modified by the use of a trigger reagent combining a very low concentration of tissue factor and activated factor (F)XI. Emicizumab quantification was performed by 3 methods: the modified 1-step FVIII assay and 2 methods based on liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using tissue factor/activated FXI-triggered TGA and platelet-poor plasma, a relationship was observed between the area under the thrombin generation curve (endogenous thrombin potential [ETP]) and the clinical response of patients to emicizumab. The ultrastructure of fibrin clots was consistent with ETP results and showed that emicizumab had a hemostatic activity equivalent to 20 to 30 IU/dL of FVIII. Finally, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses showed no correlation between ETP and LC-MS nor with modified 1-stage FVIII assay, but a statistically significant correlation between the LC-MS methods and the time-to-peak results of the TGA. Using a modified TGA, this study showed that patients who experienced breakthrough bleeds while on emicizumab had a lower thrombin-generating capacity compared with others with good clinical response to emicizumab."

    "title": "Efficacy of rehabilitation interventions on functioning in patients with hemophilic arthropathy: A systematic review with meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilic arthropathy is a detrimental condition that crucially affects functional outcomes in hemophilic patients. In recent years, due to the advances in systemic therapies, growing attention has been raised in the rehabilitation field in order to improve functional outcomes of hemophilic patients. However, the optimal rehabilitation modalities in these patients are far from being fully characterized. The present study aimed to assess the effects of different rehabilitation interventions on physical functioning and health-related quality of life of hemophilic arthropathic patients. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Five databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until June 22nd, 2023. The selection criteria included adult patients with hemophilia A and B receiving rehabilitation interventions. The outcomes were muscle strength, physical function, pain intensity, physical performance, and health-related quality of life. Out of 1,743 identified records, 17 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Rehabilitation interventions were categorized into exercise intervention, fascial therapy, and multimodal intervention. The findings suggested positive outcomes in terms of muscle modifications, range of motion improvements, joint health enhancements, pain intensity reduction, and quality of life improvements. More in detail, meta-analyses showed significant improvements in pain intensity [ES: -1.10 cm (-1.37, -0.82), p< 0.00001], joint health [ES: -1.10 (-1.38, -0.82), p< 0.00001], In accordance, exercise interventions showed significant benefits in terms of joint health [ES: -2.54 (-3.25, -1.83), p< 0.00001)] and quality of life [ES: 1.17 (0.48, 1.86), p< 0.0000)]. Rehabilitation interventions have a positive impact on functional outcomes and health-related quality of life of hemophilic arthropathic patients. Further studies are needed to better elucidate the role of a comprehensive intervention combining different rehabilitation approaches to treat hemophilic arthropathy."

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid uptake of emicizumab in the paediatric haemophilia A (HA) population, real-world data on the safety and efficacy is limited. To report on bleeding and safety in paediatric patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. Data were extracted from the multicentre prospective observational PedNet Registry (NCT02979119). Children with haemophilia A, and ≥50 FVIII exposures or inhibitors present receiving emicizumab maintenance therapy were analysed. Data were summarized as medians with interquartile range (IQR, P25-P75). Mean (95% confidence interval (CI)), annualized (joint) bleeding rate (A(J)BR) during emicizumab and ≤2 years before emicizumab prophylaxis were modelled and compared using negative binomial regression. Total of 177 patients started emicizumab at median 8.6 years (IQR 4.8-13.1), most had no FVIII inhibitors (64%). Follow up before emicizumab was median: 1.68 years (IQR: 1.24-1.90) and during emicizumab: 1.32 years (IQR: .94-2.11). In patients without inhibitors, mean ABR reduced after starting emicizumab from 2.41 (CI 1.98-2.95) to 1.11 (CI .90-1.36, p < .001), while AJBR reduced from.74 (CI .56-.98) to.31 (CI .21-.46, p < .001). Concordantly, in patients with inhibitors, mean ABR reduced from 5.08 (CI 4.08-6.38) to .75 (CI .56-1.01, p < .001), while AJBR reduced from 1.90 (CI 1.42-2.58) to .34 (CI .21-.56, p < .001). Five emicizumab-related adverse events were reported (3% of the cohort), including one patient with antidrug antibodies. This study showed improved bleeding control compared to previous treatment and a favourable safety profile during emicizumab therapy in paediatric haemophilia A patients."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy and universal use of safer, more effective, and personalised prophylactic regimens (factor, and nonfactor) are expected to prevent joint bleeding and promote joint health in persons with haemophilia (PwH). Growing evidence suggests that subclinical bleeding, with active and inactive synovial proliferation, continues and haemophilic arthropathy remains a major morbidity in PwH despite early institution of joint prophylaxis. Joint health assessment is evolving with physical examination scores complementing imaging scores. Point-of-care ultrasound is emerging as a safe, cost-effective, and readily available tool for acute determination of musculoskeletal abnormalities, serial evaluation of joints for sonographic markers of haemophilic arthropathy, and in providing objective insight into the efficacy of new therapies. In acute haemarthrosis, arthrocentesis expedites recovery and prevent the vicious cycle of bleed-synovitis-rebleed. When synovial proliferation develops, a multidisciplinary team approach is critical with haematology, orthopaedics, and physiotherapy involvement. Synovectomy is considered for patients with chronic synovitis that fail conservative management. Non-surgical and minimally invasive procedures should always be offered and considered first. Careful patient selection, screening and early intervention increase the success of these interventions in reducing bleeding, pain, and improving joint function and quality of life. Chemical synovectomy is practical in developing countries, but radioactive synovectomy appears to be more effective. When surgical synovectomy is considered, arthroscopic/minimally invasive approach should be attempted first. In advanced haemophilic arthropathy, joint replacement and arthrodesis can be considered. While excited about the future of haemophilia management, navigating musculoskeletal challenges in the aging haemophilia population is equally important."

Determine the validity and reliability of the PedHALshort Indonesia language version compared to the Haemo-QoL in the Indonesian population. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia. The subjects were children (4-16 years old) with moderate or severe haemophilia A or B with repeated joint bleeding. The daily activity was assessed using the PedHALshorts and Haemo-QoL. The validity and reliability were tested. The validity was determined with Pearson correlation test, construct validity was assessed using convergent and discriminant validity. The Spearman correlation was used to determine which domains of Haemo-QoL correlated with PedHALshort. The reliability was analyzed using test-retest reliability. Cronbach's α was used to determined internal consistency. Fifty children were included in the study (78% haemophilia A, 70% severe group). All domains were valid (r > .284). The convergent validity test showed PedHALshort had a moderate negative correlation with physical health and sports school domain of Haemo-QoL (r = -.479, p < .001). The discriminant validity test showed the PedHALshort demonstrated a moderate negative correlation with physical health (r = -.585), view (r = -.590), sport school domain (r = -.430) in severe haemophilia subjects. The internal consistency of the PedHALshort questionnaire was high (Cronbach's α of .85 (.74-.92)). The PedHALshort is valid and reliable, hence, it can be used to measure the functional physical activity of children with haemophilia."

    "abstract": "To characterise non-severe haemophilia A (HA) patients enrolled on the Australian Bleeding Disorders Registry (ABDR) treated through a state-wide Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC) with respect to their mutational profile, inhibitor risk and health-care burden. We conducted a single-centre observational study of all non-severe HA patients treated at the Alfred Health HTC registered on the ABDR as of the 26th July 2023. Data were extracted from the ABDR and electronic medical record (EMR) regarding demographics, severity, genetic testing, treatment, inhibitors, bleeding events and procedures. Inhibitor risk was calculated as a function of exposure days (EDs) of FVIII replacement. There were 289 non-severe HA patients treated at the Alfred HTC registered on the ABDR as of July 2023, all of whom were adult patients aged > 18 years old. Genotyping had been performed in 228/289 (78.9%). Of the inhibitor analysis population, 14/193 (7.3%) had an inhibitor. The cumulative incidence of inhibitor development at 75 EDs was 31% (95% CI 13%-46%). The median cost of bypassing agents per inhibitor patient was $57,087.50/year. These results demonstrate a relatively high inhibitor prevalence and incidence risk in non-severe HA compared to previously published work, although this may partly reflect a smaller population size. High rates of genotyping have allowed representative mutational characterisation. The burden of care imposed by non-severe HA in terms of bleeding events, procedures and bypassing agent cost is larger than expected, particularly within the inhibitor population."

    "abstract": "Primary prophylaxis is the gold standard in severe haemophilia A (SHA) but time to escalate the prophylaxis regimen varies. Assess prophylaxis implementation and long-term joint health outcomes in SHA with primary prophylaxis. Adult male patients born after 1980, with SHA on primary prophylaxis, started before the age of 3 years and second joint bleed, and no history of FVIII inhibitors, were enrolled. Repeated joint-health examinations were performed with HJHS or HEAD-US; VERITAS-PRO assessed adherence. Thirty patients were enrolled with, at inclusion, median age 33.5 years, annualized bleed rate and joint bleed rate 0, and FVIII consumption 4232 IU/kg/year, respectively. The median age was 1.2 years, at prophylaxis start once weekly with a median FVIII dose of 47.7 IU/kg, and 1.7 years, by the time escalation to a final regimen had occurred, with a median infusion frequency of thrice weekly and FVIII dose 41.7 IU/kg, respectively. Older age correlated with later transition to escalated prophylaxis (p < .001). Longer time to escalated prophylaxis correlated to more bleeds (p < .001). Median HJHS increased slowly, reaching 4 at 35-40 years. HJHS at 15-20 years correlated with higher HJHS afterwards. Median total HEAD-US score was 1 and correlated with HJHS (p < .001). Median VERITAS-PRO score was 36, indicating good treatment adherence. Primary prophylaxis is effective but does not completely prevent the gradual development of arthropathy in SHA. Joint assessments with HJHS should start at an early age, as they correlate with arthropathy in later life. Prophylaxis escalation should proceed expeditiously to prevent bleeds."

    "abstract": "Tailored prophylaxis is the current treatment regimen for patients with severe haemophilia A. Recently, published guidelines describe two possible approaches, based on clinical characteristics or estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters. However, both have strengths and weaknesses, and their characteristics need to be integrated to optimize treatment appropriately. In this paper, we present a model that considers together the characteristics of prophylaxis and the relevance of each. The age at initiation of prophylaxis, number of bleeding events, treatment regimen, therapeutic adherence, FVIII trough levels, and joint status were analyzed in 59 patients followed at La Paz University Hospital between January 2000 and December 2019. The mean duration of primary prophylaxis of 113.37 ± 57.79 months. Eighty-three percent (n = 49) had no joint status involvement at the end of follow-up (HJHS and HEAD-US = 0). The median ABR was 0.7 (IQR 0.2 -1.0) and 54.2% presented trough levels of FVIII during follow-up >1 IU/dL. 72,9% engaged in some type of physical activity and overall adherence was over 85% in all patients evaluated. The regression analysis performed, considering all these factors, showed that the initiation of prophylaxis before 21 months of age was the most relevant protective factor against the appearance of joint involvement (OR 88.33 p.031 CI 95% 1.49-5224.40) CONCLUSION: Early initiation of prophylaxis was the most relevant factor in the protection of joint status. More comprehensive analysis models adapted to the characteristics of each population, are needed to adequately individualize treatment."

    "abstract": "Since June 2021, patients with hemophilia A with antifactor VIII inhibitors and those with severe hemophilia A without antifactor VIII inhibitors treated with Hemlibra have had to choose between a community or hospital pharmacy. The French reference center for hemophilia developed the HEMOPHAR e-learning program for community pharmacists for dispensing emicizumab. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency and safety of this new care pathway by assessing the HEMOPHAR e-learning program. The methodology is based on Kirkpatrick's model for evaluating the immediate reaction of trained community pharmacists (level 1), their level of acquired knowledge (level 2), and their professional practice after 3 months of dispensation (level 3). The HEMOPHAR e-learning program reached a large audience, with 67% (337/502) of the eligible community pharmacists following it. The immediate reaction was overall satisfying. High rates of engagement were reported with 63.5% (214/337) to 73.3% (247/337) of completed training modules, along with high rates of success with quizzes of 61.5% (174/337) to 95.7% (244/337). We observed that 83.9% (193/230) of the community pharmacists needed less than 2 attempts to pass the quiz of the module related to professional practice, while the other quizzes required more attempts. Advice on compliance and drug interactions were most frequently provided to patients by the community pharmacists. This study suggests ways to improve the training of community pharmacists and to optimize coordination with treatment centers. This study also reports on the feasibility of switching to a community pharmacy in a secure pharmaceutical circuit, including in the context of a rare bleeding disease.

However, there is a lack of data on joint health in adult persons with hemophilia A treated with N8-GP. To describe the design of the ongoing pathfinderReal study investigating the joint health status in adult persons with hemophilia A after switching to N8-GP. pathfinderReal is a multicountry, noninterventional, single-arm study (NCT05621746) of joint health in adult (≥18 years) male persons with hemophilia A who have switched to N8-GP. Patients enrolled in other interventional studies and those who have previously terminated N8-GP treatment will be excluded. Approximately 124 adults with hemophilia A will be enrolled and followed up for a maximum of 24 months. Data from routine clinical assessments of patients' joint health will be collected. The primary endpoint is change in Hemophilia Joint Health Score (defined as a change in total score of ≤2) from initiation of N8-GP treatment until the end of the study. Secondary endpoints include number of bleeding episodes, number and resolution of target joints, patient-reported outcomes of problem joint score, pain score, and change in physical function levels. An exploratory endpoint is included to measure the number of patients achieving improved Hemophilia Joint Health Score from the initiation of N8-GP until the end of the study. The pathfinderReal study will provide insights regarding the impact of N8-GP on joint health in persons with hemophilia A in a real-world setting."

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of immunogenicity data collected during 6 clinical studies of rurioctocog alfa pegol, including a total of 360 unique previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. The analysis included treatment-emerging FVIII-neutralizing antibodies (FVIII inhibitors); preexisting and treatment-emerging antibodies binding to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG; and treatment-emerging antibodies binding to Chinese hamster ovary host cell proteins. Moreover, the potential association between the presence of these binding antibodies and adverse events (AEs) observed in patients was investigated, and the potential impact of these antibodies on the incremental recovery of rurioctocog alfa pegol in patients was analyzed. Overall, the data indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol is not associated with any unexpected immunogenicity characteristics. Of 360 patients, 1 patient developed a transient FVIII inhibitor with a titer of 0.6 Bethesda units per mL, which was not associated with any serious AEs. Antibodies binding to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG were not detected at the time when the inhibitor was present. Moreover, 54 of 360 patients either entered the clinical studies with preexisting binding antibodies or developed these antibodies after exposure to rurioctocog alfa pegol. These antibodies were transient in most patients and did not show any causal relationship to either AEs or spontaneous bleeding episodes."

Here, we review recent advances in the management of acquired haemophilia A (AHA), acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS), and patients with hemostatic abnormalities due to chronic liver disease (CLD). Patients with AHA can now benefit from prophylaxis with emicizumab, a therapeutic antibody that mimics the function of activated coagulation factor VIII. The treatment of AVWS remains challenging in many situations and requires careful consideration of the underlying condition. Haemostatic abnormalities in CLD are often compensated by proportional reduction in pro and anti-haemostatic factors resulting in sustained or even increased thrombin generation. Consequently, bleeding in CLD is rarely caused by haemostatic failure and infusion of plasma or coagulation factor concentrates may not be effective."

The purpose of this study was to provide genetic information on mothers of hemophilia patients and to understand the clotting factor activity and phenotype of HCs. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the mental health status of HCs in China. A total of 127 hemophilia mothers, including 93 hemophilia A (HA) mothers and 34 hemophilia B (HB) mothers, were enrolled in this study. Long distance PCR, multiplex PCR, and Sanger sequencing were used to analyze mutations in F8 or F9. Coagulation factor activity was detected by a one-stage clotting assay. The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90, China/Mandarin version) was given to HCs at the same time to assess their mental health. A total of 90.6% of hemophilia mothers were diagnosed genetically as carriers, with inversion in intron 22 and missense mutations being the most common mutation types in HA and HB carriers, respectively. The median clotting factor level in carriers was 0.74 IU/mL (ranging from 0.09 to 1.74 IU/mL) compared with 1.49 IU/mL (ranging from 0.93 to 1.89 IU/mL) in noncarriers, of which 14.3% of HCs had clotting factor levels of 0.40 IU/mL or below. A total of 53.8% (7/13) of HA carriers with low clotting factor levels (less than 0.50 IU/mL) had a history of bleeding, while none of the HB carriers displayed a bleeding phenotype. The total mean score and the global severity index of the SCL-90 for surveyed HCs were 171.00 (±60.37) and 1.78 (±0.59), respectively. A total of 67.7% of the respondents had psychological symptoms, with obsessive-compulsive disorder being the most prevalent and severe. The pooled estimates of all nine factors were significantly higher than those in the general population (P<0.05). The detection rate of gene mutations in hemophilia mothers was 90.6%, with a median clotting factor level of 0.74 IU/mL, and 14.3% of HCs had a clotting factor level of 0.40 IU/mL or below. A history of bleeding was present in 41.2% of HCs with low clotting factor levels (less than 0.50 IU/mL). Additionally, given the fragile mental health status of HCs in China, it is critical to develop efficient strategies to improve psychological well-being."

While the primary focus centers on the successful endovascular coil embolization of renal artery aneurysms, the concomitant presence of the AV shunt accentuates the significance of this case. Imaging techniques were crucial in the discovery of renal aneurysms and the diagnosis of the AV shunt malformation of the renal artery. This included an ultrasound, CT-angiography and digital subtraction angiography. The treatment approach employed prioritized endovascular coil embolization for its efficacy and reduced morbidity. Following the initial successful embolization, the identification of the AV shunt during subsequent embolization led to its targeted treatment. The case was also complicated by acute prostatitis that was treated medically. The patient's HA required careful administration of coagulation factor replacement therapy to control bleeding throughout the process. This case highlights the importance of reporting on the management of rare and complex pathologies to better understand and guide future treatments, especially involving this rare combination of renal AV shunts and hemophilia A."

After 18 months, 39 cyclophosphamide patients (67.2 %) and 31 rituximab patients (62.0 %) were in complete remission (OR 1.26; 95 % CI, 0.57 to 2.78). In the poor prognosis group (FVIII < 1 IU/dL, inhibitor titer > 20 BU mL<sup>-1</sup>), significantly more remissions were observed with cyclophosphamide (22 patients, 78.6 %) than with rituximab (12 patients, 48.0 %; p = 0.02). Relapse rates, deaths, severe infections, and bleeding were similar in the 2 groups. In patients with severe infection, cumulative doses of steroids were significantly higher than in patients without infection (p = 0.03). Cyclophosphamide and rituximab showed similar efficacy and safety. As first line, cyclophosphamide seems preferable, especially in poor prognosis patients, as administered orally and less expensive.

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is one of the commonest inherited bleeding disorders which may lead to long term disabilities if not treated properly. Our aim of study is to understand the clinical characteristic, treatment and complications of adult haemophilia patients in our centre. A retrospective cross-sectional review of all adult haemophilia A (HA) or haemophilia B (HB) patients who received treatment in Hospital Pulau Pinang from January 2021 to December 2022 was conducted. Data was retrieved from patients' medical records. A total of 75 haemophilia patients (64 HA and 11 HB) were included in this study with median age of 37 years (range 19 70). 42 of them had severe haemophilia (50% of HA, 91% of HB). All HB and 93.8% of severe HA patients were on prophylaxis. Six severe and one mild HA patients developed inhibitor with four of them currently on non-factor prophylaxis. 24 patients (32%) had prior hepatitis C infection and all of them have been successfully treated. The mean annual bleeding rate for severe haemophilia patients were 1.77 (SD ±3.6). Target joints were observed in 9.3% of patients with ankle joint (71.4%) being the most affected joint. More than one quarter (26.7%) of our patients have comorbidities with majority of them having hypertension (17/20), followed by diabetes mellitus (5/20) and ischemic heart disease (5/20). Our study showed that a significant number of adult patients with haemophilia have comorbidities. Apart from optimising factor replacement therapy, future planning should include improvement in screening, risk modification and prevention of cardiovascular disease."

    "abstract": "Acquired factor VIII inhibitor, also known as acquired haemophilia A, has been associated with the postpartum state in young females. Treatment of acquired haemophilia A is focused on two goals: control of bleeding and eliminating the factor VIII inhibitor. Management requires successful intervention to accomplish both goals. Here, we describe the presentation and management of a case of acquired haemophilia A resulting in particularly severe and protracted intra-abdominal bleeding after routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a young and otherwise healthy female at 3 months postpartum. Due to diffuse intra-abdominal bleeding, she required return to the operating room on five occasions for intra-abdominal packing, reassessment of bleeding and ultimate fascial closure. Her abdomen was open for 5 days. She was treated with activated recombinant human factor VIIa to bypass inhibited factor VIII, and with immunosuppression using steroids, cyclophosphamide and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. She achieved remission after 6 weeks of treatment."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia nursing practice has experienced a shift in the past decade, as the historic chief focus on factor infusions shifted to extended half-life products, bispecific antibody therapies and other non-replacement therapies. This evolution has driven a need for changes in nursing practice in many haemophilia treatment centres. This article intends to provide insights to the haemophilia nurse to champion practice changes at their haemophilia treatment centres. Two popular change theories, Lewin's three-step change model and Kotter's eight-step change model are discussed as a framework for haemophilia nurses to think, structure and be leaders in change. Examples of these models in practice could give guidance and examples to reflect on for haemophilia nurses needing to make changes in their practice settings. These models of change, alongside existing haemophilia nurse competencies and tools such as the shared decision-making tool from the World Federation of Hemophilia, can assist the nurse to be a capable change agent to usher in these new innovations."

    "abstract": "Consensus over the definition of recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) product classification in haemophilia A is lacking. rFVIII products are often classified as standard half-life (SHL) or extended half-life (EHL); despite this, no universally accepted definition currently exists. One proposed definition includes half-life, area under the curve, and technology designed to extend half-life; however, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis defines activity over time as the most intuitive information for building treatment regimens and the World Federation of Hemophilia describes rFVIII product classification in terms of infusion frequency. To summarise published data on the clinical and pharmacokinetic criteria used to define rFVIII product classification. PubMed and EMBASE database searches of English-language articles (2002-2022) were conducted using search strings to identify the relevant population, intervention, and outcomes (e.g., clinical and pharmacokinetic parameters). Articles then underwent title/abstract and full-text screens. Among 1147 identified articles, 62 were included. Half-life was the most widely reported outcome with no clear trends or product groupings observed. No clear groupings emerged among other outcomes, including infusion frequency, consumption, and efficacy. As activity over time was reported in few articles, further investigation of its relevance to rFVIII product classification is warranted. The findings of this systematic literature review suggest that parameters other than half-life might be important for the development of a comprehensive and clinically relevant rFVIII product classification definition. There seems to be an opportunity to consider parameters that are clinically meaningful and useful for shared decision-making in haemophilia A treatment."

In patients receiving prophylaxis treatment with emicizumab, concomitant rFVIIa is sometimes utilized in multiple doses for surgical procedures or breakthrough bleeding. We identified 'unresponsiveness' to rFVIIa, based on global coagulation function monitored using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in 11 PwHAwI and 5 patients with acquired HA, and investigated possible mechanisms focusing on the association between plasma FX levels and rFVIIa-mediated interactions. Our data demonstrated that FX antigen levels were lower in the rFVIIa-unresponsive group than in the rFVIIa-responsive group (0.46 ± 0.14 IU/mL vs. 0.87 ± 0.15 IU/mL, p < 0.01). This relationship was further examined by thrombin generation assays using a FX-deficient PwHAwI plasma model. The addition of FX with rFVIIa was associated with increased peak thrombin (PeakTh) generation. At low levels of FX (<0.5 IU/mL), rFVIIa failed to increase PeakTh to the normal range, consistent with clinical rFVIIa-unresponsiveness. In the presence of emicizumab (50 μg/mL), PeakTh was increased maximally to 80 % of normal, even at low levels of FX (0.28 IU/mL). Unresponsiveness to rFVIIa was associated with reduced levels of FX in PwHAwI. Emicizumab exhibited in vitro coagulation potential in the presence of FX at concentrations that appeared to limit the clinical response to rFVIIa therapy."

Of 129 trials included, 94.6% were industry sponsored, with a mean of 62 participants and mean age of 26.8 years. Overall, 52.0% (n = 66) of trials reported data on race and ethnicity, increasing from 13.9% in 2007-2012 to 22.5% in 2013-2016 to 100% in 2017-2022 (P = .001). Among these 66 trials, 65.8%, 22.8%, 5.1%, 3.9% of participants were White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black, respectively. OERs were 10% to 20% lower for White participants vs US HTC, and US, UK, and Canadian census populations and ∼75% lower for Black or Hispanic participants when compared with US HTC and US census population. OERs for Asian participants were 1.6 to 3 times higher than Canada, US, and UK census populations. The reporting of race and ethnicity in hemophilia trials has drastically improved; however, Black and Hispanic PwH remain especially underrepresented. To address these disparities, stakeholders across the clinical trial enterprise need to implement strategies to ensure equitable participation."

Factor prophylaxis has been shown to decrease the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which supports recommendations to begin at a young age. Clinical and demographic characteristics were analyzed for 883 ITs ≤2 years old with hemophilia A and B, seen at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers and enrolled in the Community Counts Registry, a surveillance program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ICH in the first 2 years of life was seen in 68 of 883 (7.7%) ITs, of whom 8 of 68 (11.8%) were on continuous prophylaxis at the time of ICH. ITs in this study usually started prophylaxis within the first year of life (mean, 10.3 months), with earlier ages of prophylaxis initiation in later birth cohorts in ITs with hemophilia A. Compared with those without a family history (FH) of hemophilia, known positive FH of hemophilia was associated with earlier age of diagnosis (P ≤ .0001) and decreased rates of vaginal delivery (P = .0006). The use of factor VIII mimetics and extended half-life clotting factor prophylaxis increased with later birth cohorts for ITs with hemophilia A and B. The study highlights that ICH rates in ITs with hemophilia remains substantial and underscores the need for further research to identify modifiable risk factors to prevent ICH by earlier diagnosis and initiating prophylaxis early, even within the first month of life."

Joint health and functional capacity were assessed using Hemophilia Joint Health Score, Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound, 6-Minute Walking test, Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults, and Hemophilia Activities List. Quadriceps muscle thickness significantly correlated with Hemophilia Joint Health Score knee, Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound knee, and Hemophilia Activities List. Calf muscle thickness significantly correlated with the Hemophilia Joint Health Score ankle. After adjusted age and body mass index, calf muscle thickness was inversely associated with the Hemophilia Joint Health Score ankle. Six-Minute Walking test was found to significantly correlate with Hemophilia Joint Health Score total, Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound total, Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults, and Hemophilia Activities List. Muscle thickness and the distance of 6-Minute Walking Test were linked to assessment of joint health, quality of life, and activity participation in people with hemophilia A. Ultrasound measurement of muscle thickness and walking test seem to be useful tools for the assessment of joint health and functional status in people with hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "Haemophilia is an inherited, X-linked blood clotting disorder caused by the deficiency of coagulation factors VIII (FVIII, haemophilia A) or IX (FIX, haemophilia B). Spontaneous bleeds are common in severe forms of haemophilia and can also occur in moderate and mild haemophilia. Severe or repeated bleeding at a joint can evolve into chronic haemophilic arthropathy, with functional damage of the joint, disability, and intense chronic articular pain. Nonetheless, acute and chronic pain may emerge due to secondary conditions related to bleedings. This narrative review aims to critically discuss the most recent evidence about pain in haemophilia to give healthcare professionals a clear picture of current knowledge hence favouring the optimisation of clinical management of pain. Extensive literature search with the terms 'hemophilia' AND 'pain', focusing on the time window 2021-2023. Acute and chronic pain is a critical aspect of haemophilia at all ages. It should be considered a multifaceted phenomenon, with a positive role as an early emergency signal of a clinical event (haemarthrosis), and numerous detrimental aspects linked to its burden that heavily affects the health-related quality of life, with psychological and social consequences. Despite its prevalence and frequency in people with haemophilia, pain is often underestimated by healthcare professionals, leading to insufficient and inadequate treatment, also due to uncertainty linked to the presence of the coagulation disorder or arthritic flares."

    "abstract": "The advent of therapeutic recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) protein infusions revolutionized the care of persons with haemophilia in the 1990s. It kicked off an era with the increasing use of prophylactic factor infusions for patients and transformed conversations around the ideal trough activity levels as well as the ultimate goals in tailored, individualized care. Our knowledge surrounding the immunologic basis of inhibitor development and treatment derives from a time when patients were receiving frequent factor infusions and focused on immune tolerance induction following inhibitor development. More recently, care was revolutionized again in haemophilia A with the approval of emicizumab, a bispecific antibody mimicking activated FVIII function, to prevent bleeding. The use of emicizumab prophylaxis has resulted in a significantly slower accumulation of factor exposure days and continued effective prophylaxis in the case of inhibitor development. While emicizumab is effective at reducing the frequency of bleeding events in patients with haemophilia A, management of breakthrough bleeds, trauma, and surgeries still requires additional treatment. Ensuring that FVIII is a therapeutic option, particularly for life-threatening bleeding events and major surgeries is critical to optimizing the care of persons with haemophilia A. Other novel non-factor concentrate therapies, including rebalancing agents, will dramatically change the landscape for persons with haemophilia B with inhibitors. This review discusses the changing landscape regarding the timing of inhibitor development and management strategies after inhibitor development, stressing the importance of education across the community to continue to vigilantly monitor for inhibitors and be prepared to treat persons with inhibitors."

Concomitant with this we are now seeing the problems of ageing in the bleeding disorder population. Although the clear-cut association between low clotting factor levels and risk of bleeding is well recognised, a relationship between high levels, some non-factor therapies and thrombotic risk also exists. The management of thrombosis in persons with inherited bleeding disorders is complex but manageable with modern treatments and collaboration in decision making between health care professionals and patients. Despite the improvements in treatment and reduction in bleeding, mostly musculoskeletal pain continues to be a major issue with advancing age. The management of pain amongst older people with haemophilia who may have multiple comorbidities should involve a person-centred, holistic, multi-disciplinary approach to support and optimise long-term physical functioning and overall quality of life."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in coagulation factor VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B) genes resulting in blood clotting disorders. Despite advances in therapies, such as recombinant proteins and products with extended half-lives, the treatment of hemophilia still faces two major limitations: the short duration of therapeutic effect and production of neutralizing antibodies against clotting factors (inhibitor). To overcome these limitations, new hemophilia treatment strategies have been established such as gene therapy, bispecific antibody, and rebalancing therapy. Although these strategies have shown promising results, it is difficult to achieve a permanent therapeutic effect. Advances in the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology have allowed sustainable treatment by correcting mutated genes. Since genome editing generates irreversible changes in host genome, safety must be ensured by delivering target organs. Therefore, the delivery tool of the CRISPR system is crucial for safe, accurate, and efficient genome editing. Recently, non-viral vector lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as safer tools for delivering CRISPR systems than other viral vectors. Several previous hemophilia pre-clinical studies using LNP-CRISPR showed that sufficient and sustainable therapeutic effects, which means that LNP-CRISPR-mediated genome-editing therapy can be a valid option for the treatment of hemophilia. In this paper, we summarize the latest advancements in the successful treatment of hemophilia and the potential of CRISPR-mediated genome-editing therapy using LNPs."

    "abstract": "Raising awareness and improving recognition, accurate classification, and enhanced access to new treatments represent current key challenges for carriers of haemophilia. Women and girls carrying genes for haemophilia often experience significant bleeding and/or low factor levels. The bleeding associated with female haemophilia is frequently overlooked, has a weak correlation with factor levels, and manifests differently than in males, with heavy menstrual bleeding being a predominant symptom. Recent changes in terminology now allow the diagnosis of haemophilia in females with low factor levels and differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of the gene. Observations from real-world experiences and limited clinical trial data have highlighted the positive impact of various new haemophilia treatments for women and girls with clotting factor deficiencies. There is an urgent need for initiatives that increase their access to these treatments and encourage well-designed clinical trials focusing on female-specific outcomes. In women with inherited bleeding disorders, early recognition and optimal management of heavy menstrual bleeding are crucial. However, treatment options and guidance from high-quality clinical trials are currently insufficient. Menstrual health assessment should be a regular part of monitoring women and girls with inherited bleeding disorders throughout their lives, emphasizing the importance of gathering data to improve future management."

An increase in physical activities for promoting musculoskeletal health may enhance the benefits of prophylactic therapy. To determine the clinical impact of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities in HA patients during low-dose PK-guided EHL FVIII prophylaxis. This prospective study enrolled patients with moderate/severe HA (baseline FVIII levels ≤ 5 IU/dL) who had received low-dose PK-guided EHL FVIII prophylaxis for ≥ 6 months. An individualized exercise protocol was introduced to each participant, targeting a 65% increase in the maximum predicted heart rate for ≥ 150 min/week, while continuing low-dose PK-guided EHL FVIII prophylaxis for 6 months. Before and after implementing the intervention, annualized bleeding rates (ABR), annualized joint bleeding rates (AJBR), Hemophilia Joint Health Scores (HJHS), skeletal muscle mass, hemophilia-specific quality-of-life (QoL) scores and annualized FVIII consumption were compared. Of 13 participants (mean age ± standard deviation [SD]: 20.1 ± 6.8 years), ABR, AJBR, and HJHS were significantly reduced (mean differences [MD] ± SD: -5.7 ± 2.6 bleeds/year, -4.2 ± 2.6 joint bleeds/year, and -4.3 ± 3.2 marks, respectively; P < 0.05) after applying the 6-month exercise protocol. Skeletal muscle mass and QoL scores had also improved (P = 0.001), while FVIII usage had decreased (MD ± SD: -129.1 ± 208.7 IU/kg/year; P < 0.05). The combination of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities with low-dose PK-guided EHL FVIII prophylaxis improves bleeding prevention, musculoskeletal status and QoL in patients with moderate/severe HA.

    "abstract": "Conventional pharmacokinetic (PK) models contain several useful inductive biases guiding model convergence to more realistic predictions of drug concentrations. Implementing similar biases in standard neural networks can be challenging, but might be fundamental for model robustness and predictive performance. In this study, we build on the deep compartment model (DCM) architecture by introducing constraints that guide the model to explore more physiologically realistic solutions. Using a simulation study, we show that constraints improve robustness in sparse data settings. Additionally, predicted concentration-time curves took on more realistic shapes compared to unconstrained models. Next, we propose the use of multi-branch networks, where each covariate can be connected to specific PK parameters, to reduce the propensity of models to learn spurious effects. Another benefit of this architecture is that covariate effects are isolated, enabling model interpretability through the visualization of learned functions. We show that all models were sensitive to learning false effects when trained in the presence of unimportant covariates, indicating the importance of selecting an appropriate set of covariates to link to the PK parameters. Finally, we compared the predictive performance of the constrained models to previous relevant population PK models on a real-world data set of 69 haemophilia A patients. Here, constrained models obtained higher accuracy compared to the standard DCM, with the multi-branch network outperforming previous PK models. We conclude that physiological-based constraints can improve model robustness. We describe an interpretable architecture which aids model trust, which will be key for the adoption of machine learning-based models in clinical practice."

This study aimed to evaluate whether laboratory measurements (global coagulation assays and emicizumab concentration) and/or arthropathy scores can distinguish patients at higher risk of spontaneous joint bleeding while on emicizumab prophylaxis. A thrombin generation assay was performed upon the addition of tissue factor and synthetic phospholipids. Nonactivated thromboelastography was performed on citrated whole blood. Emicizumab concentrations were measured using a modified 1-stage factor VIII assay. The degree of hemophilic arthropathy was assessed using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score and Hemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection with Ultrasound (HEAD-US) score. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between variables and bleeding. The predictive power of these variables was investigated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Forty patients with severe HA, with or without inhibitors, on emicizumab prophylaxis were enrolled in an observational cohort study. Ten of 40 developed spontaneous joint bleeding. None of the laboratory parameters were able to distinguish patients with a higher risk of spontaneous joint bleeding. ROC analysis showed that during emicizumab prophylaxis, only the presence of synovitis and a higher HEAD-US score were associated with spontaneous joint bleeding (area under the curve, 0.84). A greater degree of arthropathy and the presence of synovitis could help predict the risk of spontaneous joint bleeding in patients with HA on emicizumab prophylaxis."

Fifty-eight adult patients with hemophilia were randomly allocated to the experimental group (myofascial release therapy with foam roller) or the control group (no intervention whatsoever). The daily home protocol of myofascial release therapy for the lower limbs using a foam roller lasted eight consecutive weeks. The primary variable was the safety of myofascial release therapy (weekly telephone follow-up).

    "abstract": "After decades of stumbling clinical development, the first gene therapies for haemophilia A and B have been commercialized and have normalized factor (F)VIII and factor (F)IX levels in some individuals in the long term. Several other clinical programs testing adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy are at various stages of clinical testing. Multiyear follow-up in phase 1/2 and 3 studies showed long-term and sometimes curative but widely variable and unpredictable efficacy. Liver toxicities, mostly low-grade, occur in the 1st year in at least some individuals in all haemophilia A and B trials and are poorly understood. Wide variability and unpredictability of outcome and slow decline of FVIII levels are a major disadvantage because immune responses to AAV vectors preclude repeat dosing, which otherwise could improve suboptimal or restore declining expression, while overexpression may predispose to thrombosis. Long-term safety outcomes will need lifelong monitoring because AAV vectors infused at high doses integrate into chromosomes at rates that raise questions about potential oncogenicity and necessitate vigilance. Alternative gene transfer systems employing gene editing and/or non-viral vectors are under development and promise to overcome some limitations of the current state of the art for both haemophilia A and B. AAV gene therapies for haemophilia have now become new treatment options but not universal cures. AAV is a powerful but imperfect gene transfer platform. Biobetter FVIII transgenes may help solve some problems plaguing gene therapy for haemophilia A. Addressing variability and unpredictability of efficacy, and delivery of gene therapy to ineligible patient subgroups may require different gene transfer systems, most of which are not ready for clinical translation yet but bring innovations needed to overcome the current limitations of gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Introduction Hemophilia is an uncommon, X-linked recessive bleeding condition characterized by a lack of either factor VIII or factor IX. It is more prevalent in men. Due to the substantial impact inhibitor development has on patient prognosis, the primary treatment for hemophilia is the transfusion of recombinant factors. The aim of our study is to investigate 40 adult patients with hemophilia in terms of their clinical profile, clinically relevant risk factors for inhibitor development, therapy-related aspects such as treatment duration, factor requirements, transfusion frequency, presence of inhibitors, and complications. Methods This cross-sectional observational study involving 40 patients of hemophilia over 12 years of age was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Gujarat. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, presenting complaints, bleeding episodes, hemophilia type, and medical history were gathered over a one-year span. Patients were stratified into mild, moderate, and severe groups based on their respective levels of factor activity. Various parameters, including the frequency of factor therapy, percentage of factor concentrate, inhibitor presence, and disease and therapy-related complications, were analyzed. The distribution of patients across these parameters was calculated and illustrated using pie charts. Results Nineteen out of 40 patients were from 20 to 40 years of age. The majority of cases (n=24), however, had been diagnosed before the patients reached the age of 10. All patients were male, and half of the patients (n=20) suffered from mild disease. The most common site of bleeding was the knee joint, and 33 cases had one to 10 bleeding episodes per year. Thirty-two out of 40 patients needed less than 40 factor vial transfusions, whereas eight needed more than 40 factor vial transfusions. Two cases of severe disease were positive for inhibitors of factor VIII, whereas one patient was found to have a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Conclusions Hemophilia, a rare bleeding disorder, has primarily been studied in pediatric populations. This study, however, shifts the focus toward adult individuals. Our cohort consisted exclusively of male patients, with the predominant group diagnosed with hemophilia A and falling within the age range of 20 to 40 years. Most patients had been diagnosed before 10 years of age. The primary complication observed was joint bleeding, with the knee joint being the most commonly affected site. Approximately two-thirds of cases had a history of minor trauma necessitating factor replacement, yet only 5% exhibited the presence of inhibitors."

    "title": "Haemophilia care in Asia: Learning from clinical practice in some Asian countries.",
    "abstract": "The healthcare systems in Asia vary greatly due to the socio-economic and cultural diversities which impact haemophilia management. An advisory board meeting was conducted with experts in haemophilia care from Asia to understand the heterogeneity in clinical practices and care provision in the region. The overall prevalence of haemophilia in Asia ranges between 3 and 8.58/100,000 patients. Haemophilia A was more prevalent as compared to haemophilia B with a ratio of around 5:1. There is under-diagnosis in the region due to lack of diagnosis, registries and/or lack of appropriate facilities in suburban areas. Most patients are referred to the haematologists by their families or primary care physicians, while some are identified during bleeding episodes. Genetic testing faces obstacles like resource constraints, services available at limited centres and unwillingness of patients to participate. Prophylaxis is offered for people with haemophilia (PWH) with a severe bleeding phenotype. Recombinant factors are approved in most countries across the region and are the preferred therapy. The challenges highlighted for not receiving a high standard of care include patients' reluctance to use an intravenous treatment, poor patient compliance due to frequency of infusions, budget constraints and lack of funding, insurance, availability and accessibility of factor concentrates. Prevalence of neutralizing antibodies ranged from 5% to 20% in the region. Use of immune tolerance induction and bypassing agents to treat inhibitors depends on their cost and availability. Haemophilia care in Asia has evolved to a great extent. However, some challenges remain for which a strategic approach along with multi-stakeholder involvement are needed."

    "title": "How much prophylaxis is enough in haemophilia?",
    "abstract": "Prophylaxis has become standard of care for all persons with haemophilia (PWH) with a severe phenotype. However, 'standard prophylaxis' with either factor or non-factor therapies (currently only emicizumab available) is prohibitively expensive for much of the world. We sought to address the question of 'How much prophylaxis is enough?' and 'Can it be individualized?' and specifically 'Can emicizumab be individualized?'. We reviewed the literature on prophylaxis in haemophilia since its inception in the 1950s to the present, the development of more and less intense factor prophylaxis regimens and their outcomes and additionally the published outcomes of prophylaxis with low dose emicizumab. What these experiences collectively show is that low dose emicizumab does result in significant benefits to patients whilst being much less expensive than a \"one size fits all\" emicizumab prophylaxis approach. We also took note that some non-factor therapies still in development are individualized given that high doses of these can potentially put patients at risk. Prophylaxis is now clearly accepted as standard of care for PWH with a severe phenotype but now in a very short time a large assortment of different treatment options for prophylaxis have become/are becoming available and the haemophilia community will need to determine how to best use these recognizing that no 'one treatment fits all'."

    "abstract": "Chronic joint pain is a significant and widespread symptom in people with haemophilia (PWH). Despite medical advancements, effective pain management remains challenging. This study presents an innovative approach that integrates remote physical exercises, pain neuroscience education, and coping strategies to address chronic pain in PWH. The remote intervention consisted of sixteen 5-min videos encompassing physical exercises for chronic pain management and pain education strategies. These videos formed an 8-week remote intervention program. Clinical and physical assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. A total of thirty-one PWHs, with a median age of 34 years (ranging from 16 to 59 years), completed the remote intervention. The study revealed significant improvements in pain intensity, disability, and physical performance among PWH with chronic pain. Enhanced functional capacity was evident in the Timed Up and Go and Single Leg Stance tests, accompanied by improved scores on the Functional Independence Score in Haemophilia (FISH). Although lacking a control group, our findings are consistent with other successful exercise and pain education programs. This innovative intervention holds promise for managing chronic pain in PWH, underscoring patient empowerment, education, and collaboration. Notably, our study stands out by uniquely combining pain education and coping strategies, bolstering evidence for effective pain management."

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by persistent systemic activation of coagulation, but there is yet no information on coagulation and fibrinolysis potentials in Emi-treated PwHA with DIC. To examine the effect of Emi on coagulation and fibrinolysis potentials in HA-model DIC plasmas. Plasma from a patient with sepsis-DIC (seven patients) was treated with anti-factor (F)VIII monoclonal antibody (HA-model DIC plasma) and incubated with Emi (50 µg/mL). The plasma was then assessed using clot-fibrinolysis waveform analysis (CFWA). Coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters were expressed as ratios relative to normal plasma (|min1|-ratio and |FL-min1|-ratio, respectively). In case 1, coagulant potential was slightly high and fibrinolytic potential was extremely low, presenting a coagulant-dominant state (|min1|-ratio/|FL-min1|-ratio: 1.1/.38). In cases 2-5, fibrinolytic potential was not suppressed, but there were marked hypercoagulant potentials, indicating relative coagulant-dominant states. In case 6, coagulant and fibrinolytic potentials were increased but well balanced (|min1|-ratio/|FL-min1|-ratio: 1.38/1.28). In case 7, both potentials were severely deteriorated in not only CFWA but also the thrombin/plasmin generation assay. The addition of Emi into the HA-model DIC plasmas increased |min1|-ratio values in all cases, but the coagulant potentials did not exceed the initial ones (DIC plasma before treatment with anti-FVIII antibody). The presence of Emi in the HA-model DIC plasma improved coagulation potentials, but did not increase coagulation potentials beyond those of DIC plasma in non-HA states."

    "abstract": "T2-relaxometry could differentiate between physiological and haemorrhagic joint effusion (≥ 5% blood) in vitro. Are quantitative T2-relaxation time measurements of synovial fluid feasible and reproducible in vivo in clinically bleed-free joints of men with haemophilia? In this cross-sectional study, we measured T2-relaxation times of synovial fluid in clinically bleed-free ankles, knees or elbows of men with severe haemophilia A using a T2-mapping sequence (duration ≤ 7 min) at 3 Tesla MRI. Manual and circular regions of interest (ROI) were drawn in the synovial fluid of each joint by two independent observers to measure T2-relaxation times. Measurement feasibility was expressed as the success rate of the measurements by both observers. The interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of the measurements were evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient of absolute agreement (ICC) and the limits of agreement (LoA) from Bland Altman analysis. We evaluated 39 clinically bleed-free joints (11 ankles, 12 knees, 16 elbows) of 39 men (median age, 24 years; range 17-33) with severe haemophilia A. The success rate of the T2-measurements was ≥ 90%. Interobserver reliability was good to excellent (manual ROI: ICC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.76-0.97; circular ROI: ICC = 0.82, 95% CI 0.66-0.91) and interobserver agreement was adequate (manual ROI: LoA = 71 ms; circular ROI: LoA = 146 ms). Intraobserver reliability was good to excellent (manual ROI: ICC = 0.78, 95% CI - 0.06-0.94; circular RO: ICC = 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99) and intraobserver agreement was good (manual ROI: LoA = 63 ms; circular ROI: LoA = 41 ms).

    "abstract": "Non-mutated FVIII-specific CD4 T cell epitopes have been recently found to contribute to the development of inhibitors in patients with hemophilia A (HA), while auto-reactive CD4 T cells specific to FVIII circulate in the blood of healthy individuals at a frequency close to the foreign protein ovalbumin. Thus, although FVIII is a self-protein, the central tolerance raised against FVIII appears to be low. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the FVIII CD4 T cell repertoire in 29 healthy donors. Sequencing of the CDR3β TCR region from isolated FVIII-specific CD4 T cells revealed a limited usage and pairing of TRBV and TRBJ genes as well as a mostly hydrophobic composition of the CDR3β region according to their auto-reactivity. The FVIII repertoire is dominated by a few clonotypes, with only 13 clonotypes accounting for half of the FVIII response. Through a large-scale epitope mapping of the full-length FVIII sequence, we identified 18 immunodominant epitopes located in the A1, A3, C1, and C2 domains and covering half of the T cell response. These epitopes exhibited a broad specificity for HLA-DR or DP molecules or both. T cell priming with this reduced set of peptides revealed that highly expanded clonotypes specific to these epitopes were responsible individually for up to 32% of the total FVIII repertoire. These FVIII T cell epitopes and clonotypes were shared among HLA-unrelated donors tested and previously reported HA patients. Our study highlights the role of the auto-reactive T cell response against FVIII in HA and its similarity to the response observed in healthy individuals. Thus, it provides valuable insights for the development of new tolerance induction and deimmunization strategies."

We evaluated gait function among PwH with HA, PwH without HA, and people without haemophilia (non-PwH) using a Zebris FDM-T treadmill (FDM-T), an easy-to-use gait assessment instrument with a force sensor matrix. The following gait parameters were collected: centre of pressure trajectory intersection (COPi) anterior/posterior variability, COPi lateral variability, COPi anterior/posterior symmetry, COPi lateral symmetry, single-limb support line (SLSL) length, and SLSL variability. Participants walked at their typical gait speed. The physical function of the PwH was assessed by the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). Parameters were compared among the three groups. Twelve PwH with HA, 28 PwH without HA, and 12 non-PwH were enrolled. Gait speed significantly differed between groups (non-PwH, 3.1 ± 0.7; PwH without HA, 2.0 ± 0.7; PwH with HA; 1.5 ± 0.4). The COPi anterior/posterior variability, COPi lateral variability, SLSL length, and SLSL variability were greater in the PwH groups than in the non-PwH group. The COPi lateral symmetry differed between PwH with HA and the other groups. The HJHS was not correlated with gait parameters among PwH with HA. Gait parameters and speed were abnormal in both PwH with HA and PwH without HA. The FDM-T can be used to identify early stages of physical dysfunction that cannot be detected by conventional functional assessments such as the HJHS."

Insurance denials and high costs remain barriers to its use. To determine the safety and efficacy of crushed tranexamic acid tablets in water (cTXAw) for children with bleeding disorders. We retrospectively reviewed records of children (<10 years) with bleeding disorders who received cTXAw or EACA OS from 1 December 2018, through 31 July 2022, at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota). Bleeding outcomes were defined according to ISTH criteria. Thirty-two patients were included (median age, 3 years; male, n = 23). Diagnoses were VWD (n = 17), haemophilia (n = 5), FVII deficiency (n = 3), inherited platelet disorder (n = 4), ITP (n = 2), and combined FV and FVII deficiencies (n = 1). Thirty-two courses of cTXAw (monotherapy 24/32; mean duration 6 days) and fifteen courses of EACA (monotherapy 12/15; mean duration 5 days) were administered. No surgical procedures (n = 28) were complicated by bleeding. Of the 19 bleeding events, 16 had effective haemostasis, two had no reported outcome, and one had no response. cTXAw and EACA were equally effective in preventing and treating bleeding (p value > .1). No patients had adverse effects. Eight of 19 patients (42%) who were initially prescribed EACA OS did not receive it because of cost or insurance denial. The estimated average wholesale price of one treatment was $94 for cTXAw and $905 for EACA OS. CTXAw appears to be an effective, safe, and low-cost alternative option to EACA OS for young children with bleeding disorders."

While psychosocial support is considered a core tenet of the haemophilia comprehensive care structure, the extent to which mental health challenges are detected and monitored by the individuals treating haematologist remains relatively unexplored. To describe prevalence of anxiety and depression in a real-world cohort of adult PwHA and evaluate the congruence in reporting of anxiety or depression (A/D) between PwHA and their treating physicians. Data for PwHA without inhibitors was drawn from the European 'Cost of Haemophilia: A Socioeconomic Survey II' (CHESS II) study. Haematologist-indicated comorbidities of anxiety and depression were unified into a single A/D indicator. The EQ-5D-5L health status measure was used to characterise self-reported A/D, with individuals stratified into two non-mutually exclusive subgroups based on level of A/D reported (Subgroup A: 'some' or above; Subgroup B: 'moderate' or above). Of 381 PwHA with evaluable EQ-5D-5L responses, 54% (n = 206) self-reported at least some A/D (Subgroup A) and 17% (n = 66) reported at least moderate A/D (Subgroup B). Patient-physician congruence in A/D reporting was 53% and 76% for Subgroups A and B, respectively. Descriptive analysis suggested that individuals with physician- and/or self-reported A/D experienced worse clinical outcomes (bleeding events, joint disease, chronic pain). While adverse clinical outcomes appear to correlate with A/D, self-reports of moderate-severe symptoms occasionally lacked formal recognition from treating physicians. Cross-disciplinary surveillance of mental health issues could improve both psychological and clinical outcomes among PwHA."

There is a limited amount of health utility data (a measure of health-related quality of life) available for patients with haemophilia A. This information is crucial for cost-effectiveness analysis for haemophilia A treatment. The goal of this project is to elicit the health utilities and factors impacting utility values for haemophilia A patients in Canada. This is a population-based, cross-sectional, retrospective study of health utilities in patients with haemophilia A using Patient Report Outcomes Burdens and Experiences (PROBE) components from the Canadian Bleeding Disorders Registry (CBDR). A review of the mean utilities for three severity states, defined by clotting factor VIII level, was completed. A multiple linear regression analysis was completed to examine the determinants of health utilities including age, treatment type, chronic pain status, number of limited joints, and bleed rate. The average utility values (and standard deviations) for patients with haemophilia A in Canada are .79(.17), .76(.20), and .77(.19) for patients with severe, moderate, and mild haemophilia. The regression showed chronic pain status and the number of additional comorbidities as major significant factors (p-value < .001) in haemophilia A utility. Haemophilia severity was shown to be a major factor with smaller p-value (p-value < .05). Haemophilia A patients have lower utility than the general population. Chronic pain was shown to be a significant, major factor in health-related quality of life. Our study is essential for valuing health outcomes in haemophilia A-related cost-effectiveness analysis."

    "abstract": "Advances in haemophilia treatment have resulted in a near-normal life expectancy, lower burden of bleeding and treatment, and improved quality of life in high-income countries. Bleeding rate is approaching zero and novel parameters should be evaluated to assess the efficacy of treatment not only from the clinical point of view by using new methodologies (e.g. joint health assessment), but also from the patient's perspective (e.g. pain, quality of life, treatment satisfaction). This approach should be aimed at combining objective clinical methodologies and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). However, some instruments used for assessing PROs are still suboptimal and not properly validated. Recent evidence suggests that these tools can take advantage from a more personalized designed approach and could be effectively improved and serve to facilitate the patient's self-evaluation. For other congenital bleeding disorders (BDs), a set of patient-relevant outcomes has been also defined that overlap substantially those of haemophilia, including bleeding, side effects and complications, and PROs, such as pain, physical functioning, impact on daily life including school and work and mental health. There is a growing focus on addressing women-specific outcomes in BDs, reflecting an increased awareness of the unique challenges faced by women in this context. However, the development of tailored tools is imperative to further advance the progress in managing women with BDs, ensuring more accurate monitoring and personalized care. How incorporating these outcome measures in the process of approval of novel treatments for these disorders by regulatory authorities remains to be established."

    "title": "Prophylactic Treatment of Children with Hemophilia in Sweden.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A/B are caused by deficiency or lack of coagulation factors VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively, in plasma. A person with hemophilia develops bleeding in the joints and muscles at an early age, which, if left untreated, leads to early arthropathy. Preventive treatment can be achieved by regular (prophylactic) administration of FVIII/FIX. In 1958, this was implemented on a small scale in Sweden with FVIII in patients with severe hemophilia A, and in those with hemophilia B in 1972 when FIX became available. However, there were problems with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis infection from contaminated blood products. In the 1990s, recombinant FVIII and FIX concentrates were introduced. The major remaining problems then were the development of inhibitors, and the need for a venous route for the injections in very young children. High-titer inhibitors were treated by immune tolerance induction according to a modified model of the original Bonn high-dose protocol. A central venous line, i.e., Port-A-Cath, has enabled early prophylaxis in many children with poor venous access and has enabled the early start of home treatment with adequate injection frequency. Scoring systems for X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and function of joints were developed early in Sweden and have been widely disseminated worldwide, partly with modifications. Extended half-life products with half-life increased three to five times have been developed, which can provide superior bleed protection when dosed once-weekly and can maintain therapeutic trough levels when administered less frequently. The ultimate prophylaxis therapy in the future may be gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Transformational advances have occurred in the management of haemophilia in the last decade leading to much better outcomes. However, a detailed and critical examination of its assessment and reporting show gaps in many aspects. These are discussed in this review. The relevant literature related to different aspects of management of haemophilia was reviewed to identify gaps which need to be addressed. These include detection and diagnosis of haemophilia, documentation and reporting of joint bleeding, its management and methods of reporting in clinical trials and practice, aspects of personalizing care as well as access to therapeutic products and the need for and organization of comprehensive care. Current diagnostic approaches have more than doubled the identified number of persons with haemophilia (PWH) over the last 25 years but still constitute only ∼30% of the expected number. Joint bleeding is the primary indicator of disease severity and treatment efficacy, but there is lack of consistency and standardization in the way it is recorded and reported. Its continued use as an efficacy measure of modern treatments which maintain steady state factor levels or equivalence of >5% will lack sensitivity. The treatment of acute haemarthrosis has focussed on haemostasis and pain control, ignoring the role of inflammation in joint damage. Phenotypic heterogeneity of severe haemophilia has recognized clinical and laboratory variations based on haemostasis but not differences in local response to blood in the joint. At the organizational level, IU/capita provides a relevant measure of access to therapeutic products when the detection rate is ∼100% but is fallaciously low when detection rates are very low. With highly effective modern therapies for haemophilia and nearly no bleeding, the concept of comprehensive care team will need modifications. As haemophilia care advances, a deeper dive is needed into the details of various aspects its management to ensure consistency and contemporary relevance."

However, data on the long-term development of arthropathy are still scant. To evaluate long-term arthropathy development since the introduction of prophylaxis according to birth cohort, hemophilia severity, and inhibitor status. This single-center historic cohort study included persons with severe and moderate hemophilia A and hemophilia B born between 1935 and 2005. Arthropathy on X-rays was evaluated using the Pettersson score. Patient and joint characteristics were studied per birth cohort (<1970, 1970-1980, 1981-1990, and >1990) and compared according to hemophilia severity. The distribution of affected joints and cumulative incidence of arthropathy were analyzed. The association of Pettersson score with birth cohort and inhibitor characteristics was explored using multivariable regression analyses adjusted for age at evaluation. In total, 1064 X-rays of 363 patients were analyzed. Of persons with severe hemophilia (<i>n</i> = 317, 87.3%), 244 (77.0%) developed arthropathy. Prophylaxis was started at younger ages over time, from a median of 18 to 2.1 years, and concomitantly, arthropathy decreased in consecutive birth cohorts. Ankles were most commonly affected in 188 of 258 (72.9%) patients. Persons with moderate hemophilia (<i>n</i> = 46, 12.7%) had a lower risk of arthropathy (27/46 [58.7%]), but a reduction over time was less pronounced. In the multivariable analyses, birth cohort and age at evaluation were predictors for the development of arthropathy, while inhibitor status showed no association. The development and severity of arthropathy have decreased over the past decades. However, patients have remained at risk for developing arthropathy, especially in their ankles."

In these patients, deep intronic variation or F8 disrupting genomic rearrangement could be causal. The study aimed to identify the causal variation in families with a history of severe HA for whom genetic investigations failed. We performed whole F8 gene sequencing in 8 propositi. Genomic rearrangements were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of breakpoint junctions and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A structural variant disrupting F8 was found in each propositus, so that all the 815 families with a history of severe HA registered in our laboratory received a conclusive genetic diagnosis. These structural variants consisted of 3 balanced inversions, 3 large insertions of gained regions, and 1 retrotransposition of a mobile element. The 3 inversions were 105 Mb, 1.97 Mb, and 0.362 Mb in size. Among the insertions of gained regions, one corresponded to the insertion of a 34 kb gained region from chromosome 6q27 in F8 intron 6, another was the insertion of a 447 kb duplicated region from chromosome 9p22.1 in F8 intron 14, and the last one was the insertion of an Xq28 349 kb gained in F8 intron 5. All the genetically unsolved cases of severe HA in this cohort were due to structural variants disrupting F8. This study highlights the effectiveness of whole F8 sequencing to improve the molecular diagnosis of HA when the conventional approach fails."

The treatment with emicizumab showed tolerable safety both in clinical trials and long-term real-world observations with few thrombotic events. In some clinical trials with rebalancing therapies (fitusiran and concizumab) thrombotic events occurred. Monitoring of the haemostatic function of novel therapies especially with concomitant haemostatic treatment is not yet established.

    "title": "Budget impact and cost-utility analysis of prophylactic emicizumab versus on-demand bypassing agents for adolescent severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India.",
    "abstract": "Severe Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors are currently being treated with bypassing agents like activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa. Emicizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, introduced to reduce the bleeding events, improve treatment adherence, and quality of life. However, cost-effectiveness and long-term sustainability of the intervention is not studied in a low middle income setting like India. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of Emicizumab compared to traditional bypassing agents in the treatment of severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India. Secondary objective was to analyze the budgetary impact of introducing Emicizumab for this patient population from the perspective of public health system in India. Markov model was created to compare the prophylactic emicizumab therapy against bypassing agents for a hypothetical cohort of 10-year-old adolescents in India. The time horizon was 10 years and model built based on health system perspective. Cost utility was expressed as costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. All costs were expressed as 2021 US dollars. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness of the estimates. Prophylactic emicizumab was a cost saving intervention with negative Incremental Cost Utility Ratio (ICUR) against recombinant factor VIIa of -853,573 USD (INR -63,109,773), and negative ICUR of -211,675 USD (INR -15,650,403) against APCC. The estimated total budget for treating all the severe Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India was USD 59,042,000 (INR 4,365,329,312) for 10 years' time horizon (per patient cost of USD 295,210 [INR 21,826,646.56]). Prophylactic emicizumab therapy is a cost saving intervention when compared to both the bypassing agents as it is less costly and more effective for severe Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India."

A 31-year-old woman was diagnosed with acquired factor VIII deficiency while undergoing induction of labor. Her labor and post operative course were complicated by epidural hematoma formation, prolonged postoperative surgical site bleeding, and subcutaneous hematoma. Management included blood products, human Factor VII, rituximab, and a steroid taper. Acquired factor VIII deficiency can be challenging to diagnose and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with prolonged bleeding accompanied by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a rare constitutional bleeding disorder due to a deficiency in Factor VIII or Factor IX. Recurrent hemarthroses, one of the major complications of the disease, lead to hemophilic arthropathy, a disabling condition that requires early diagnosis. Traditionally, clinical examination and plain film radiography have been used to diagnose hemophilic arthropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound can be more useful for diagnosing soft-tissue changes. However, but each of these methods has limitations and diagnosis of arthropathy can be delayed. The aim of this project was to assess plasmatic biomolecules indicative of osteo-cartilaginous damage in patients with hemophilia with or without known arthropathy, in order to improve the diagnosis of this major complication of the disease. In this monocentric retrospective study, 40 patients with hemophilia A or B, for whom a plasma sample was available, provided informed consent for further analyses (multiplex immunoassays and ELISA) and collection of relevant clinical information in their medical files. Correlations were sought for between biomarkers of interest and the severity of joint lesions assessed according to Pettersson's radiologic score. Two biomarkers were identified, respectively SDF-1α and COMP. Their plasmatic levels were significantly increased in patients with arthropathy compared to controls and patients without arthropathy. These values correlated significantly with the Pettersson score in patients under regular prophylaxis. Two plasma biomarkers have been identified that could help assess the presence and severity of hemophilic arthropathy."

Forty-eight children with HKA (age: 8-16 years) were randomly allocated to the Plyo-HKT group (<i>n</i> = 24; underwent the Plyo-HKT for 45 min, twice/week over 12 wk in succession) or the comparison group (<i>n</i> = 24; performed the standard exercise rehabilitation at an equivalent frequency and duration).

    "abstract": "Immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the only treatment to eradicate inhibitors in people with severe haemophilia A with inhibitors. Since the risk of inhibitor development is greater among Black and Hispanic persons, it has been hypothesized that race and ethnicity may influence ITI success. Limited studies have evaluated this hypothesis. To examine the success of ITI according to race and ethnicity. Participants who entered the Community Counts (CC) Registry between 2013 and 2017, were aged ≥3 years at study entry, and received ITI were included (n = 559). The proportion of participants with successful ITI was examined with adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Among 559 participants, 56.9%, 19.1%, 18.1% and 4.3% were Non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, Hispanic and Asian, respectively, and 1.7% were coded as other or missing. Approximately 80% of Hispanic, NH Black and NH White participants had good/very good prognosis, defined as having a pre-ITI peak inhibitor of < 200 Bethesda Units per millilitre. Nearly 60% of participants (59.7%) achieved successful ITI, 20.7% and 19.5% experienced partially successful or failed ITI, respectively. Successful ITI was non-significantly lower in NH Black (54.2%; aPR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.62-1.44) and Hispanic (55.4%; aPR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.71-1.13) relative to NH White participants (62.6%). In this study, 60% of participants in the CC Registry had successful ITI, consistent with previous studies. The proportion with successful ITI was generally comparable across racial and ethnic groups with similar prognosis. These findings do not support the hypothesis that ITI response varies according to race or ethnicity."

    "title": "Using evidence-based co-design to develop a hybrid delivered exercise intervention that aims to increase confidence to exercise in people with haemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Due to advances in treatments, people with haemophilia (PWH) are living longer. They are not as active as the general population due to joint damage and lack confidence to be active due to concerns about further bleeds and pain. There is a need to facilitate healthy aging through promotion of physical activity (PA) and exercise. Changing patient beliefs and increasing physical literacy and confidence to move are thought to be key to helping PWH become more active. This paper describes the development of an exercise and behaviour change intervention to improve confidence to exercise in PWH. The 4-stage Medical Research Council framework for complex intervention development was used. Stakeholders included 17 PWH and 7 physiotherapists working in haemophilia. Seven online focus group meetings were held. The final intervention is a hybrid 12-week physiotherapist led progressive exercise programme. Classes are 45 min including Pilates, High intensity interval training and balance elements, together with discussion sessions focusing on PA recommendations, the types and benefits of different exercise styles and the effects of PA, together with the effects of aging for PWH. The COM-B model of behaviour change was used to develop the intervention. Co-design helps to produce an intervention that understands the stakeholders needs. Through this process the intervention developed to incorporate not only increasing PA but also confidence to exercise. The use of behaviour change theory identified the behaviour techniques included in the intervention and aims to increase physical literacy in this population."

    "abstract": "The 2022 World Federation of Haemophilia Annual Global Survey (AGS) reports that 454,690 patients with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) have been identified globally. While this represents noteworthy progress, haemophilia epidemiology data indicate that 75% of people with inherited bleeding disorders living in low-income and low-to-middle-income countries have yet to be diagnosed. The AGS also revealed that 11 billion clotting factor units are available to treat haemophilia A and B globally. Due to a lack of finance, these treatments are unavailable to haemophilia in low-income countries with a consequence lack of access equity for haemophilia treatment in these communities. This sobering reality is not limited to haemophilia but applies to von Willebrand Disease (VWD). While VWD is the most prevalent IBD, only 103,844 people living with this condition have been diagnosed globally. Of the diagnosed patients, only a fraction live in low- or middle-income countries. Moreover, the majority of VWD patients are still treated sub-optimally without replacement therapies or prophylaxis, both of which are now accepted as global standards of care. In this state-of-the-art review, the authors reflect on three issues. First, the minimum elements required to diagnose haemophilia in a resource-constrained setting are identified. Second, this review points to the critical stakeholders and outlines their roles in removing access to haemophilia treatment barriers. Finally, the authors examine von Willebrand disease's ongoing diagnostic and treatment challenges and compare these to haemophilia. With the rapidly evolving novel therapies, the therapeutic landscape of all IBD will likely change for the better."

    "abstract": "Throughout the years, several hundred million people with rare genetic disorders have been receiving only symptom management therapy. However, research and development efforts worldwide have led to the development of long-lasting, highly efficient, and safe gene therapy for a wide range of hereditary diseases. Improved viral vectors are now able to evade the preexisting immunity and more efficiently target and transduce therapeutically relevant cells, ensuring genome maintenance and expression of transgenes at the relevant levels. Hematological, ophthalmological, neurodegenerative, and metabolic therapeutic areas have witnessed successful treatment of hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, restoration of immune system in children with immunodeficiencies, and restoration of vision. This review focuses on three leading vector platforms of the past two decades: adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), adenoviruses (AdVs), and lentiviruses (LVs). Special attention is given to successful preclinical and clinical studies that have led to the approval of gene therapies: six AAV-based (Glybera® for lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Luxturna® for retinal dystrophy, Zolgensma® for spinal muscular atrophy, Upstaza® for AADC, Roctavian® for hemophilia A, and Hemgenix® for hemophilia B) and three LV-based (Libmeldy® for infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, Zynteglo® for β-thalassemia, and Skysona® for ALD). The review also discusses the problems that arise in the development of gene therapy treatments, which, nevertheless, do not overshadow the successes of already developed gene therapies and the hope these treatments give to long-suffering patients and their families."

    "abstract": "Until recently, the treatment of hemophilia A relied on factor (F)VIII replacement. However, up to one-third of patients with severe hemophilia A develop neutralizing alloantibodies that render replacement therapies ineffective. The development of emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that partially mimics FVIIIa, has revolutionized the treatment of these patients. However, the use of an activated prothrombin complex concentrate [FEIBA (Takeda)] to treat breakthrough bleeding in patients on emicizumab has been associated with thrombotic complications including a unique microangiopathy. We hypothesized that the thrombotic complications observed with the combination of emicizumab and FEIBA might be due to excessive expression of procoagulant activity on the surface of endothelial cells. We examined the ability of emicizumab to promote FX activation on endothelial cells using 2 cell culture models. We found that endothelial cells readily support emicizumab-mediated activation of FX by FIXa. The level of FXa generation depends on the concentration of available FIXa. The addition of FEIBA to emicizumab increased FXa generation in a dose-dependent manner on endothelial cells in both models. The rate of FXa generation was further enhanced by endothelial cell activation. However, unlike emicizumab, we found limited FXa generation in the presence of FVIII(a), which followed a significant lag time and was not dependent on FIXa concentration under these conditions. Emicizumab promotes FXa generation on the surface of endothelial cells, which is markedly enhanced in the presence of FEIBA. These findings demonstrate a potential mechanism for the thrombotic complications seen with the combined use of emicizumab and FEIBA."

A cross-sectional analysis was carried out using existing data from two independent studies (2018-2019) at paediatric hospitals in London,UK. CYP with haemophilia (n=35) and CF (n=134) aged 5-18 years were included. Published reference equations for standardising ISWT were evaluated through a comparison of populations, and Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the level of agreement between distances predicted by each equation. Associations between ISWT and disease severity were assessed with linear regression. Three relevant reference equations were identified for the ISWT that standardised performance based on age, sex and body mass index (Vardhan, Lanza, Pinho). A systematic proportional bias of standardised ISWT was observed in all equations, most pronounced with Vardhan and Lanza; the male Pinho equation was identified as most appropriate. On average, CYP with CF and haemophilia performed worse than predicted by the Pihno equation, although the range was wide. Standardised ISWT, and not ISWT distance alone, was significantly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s in CYP with CF. Standardised ISWT in CYP with haemophilia was slightly associated with haemophilia joint health score, but this was not significant. ISWT performance may be useful in a clinic to identify those with worsening disease, but only when performance is standardised against a healthy reference population. The development of validated global reference equations is necessary for more robust assessment."

This is the first study investigating the full spectrum of FVIII-specific antibodies, including non-neutralizing antibodies, very-low titer inhibitors, and inhibitors, in a large nationwide population of persons with hemophilia A of all severities. All persons with hemophilia A (mild (FVIII > 5-40 IU/dL)/moderate [FVIII 1-5 IU/dL)/severe (FVIII < 1 IU/dL)] with an available plasma sample who participated in the <i>sixth Hemophilia in the Netherlands</i> study between 2018 and 2019 were included. The presence of anti-FVIII antibodies of the immunoglobulin A, M, and G isotypes and IgG subclasses, along with antibody titer levels, were assessed using direct-binding ELISAs. FVIII specificity was assessed using a competition-based ELISA approach. The inhibitor status was determined using the Nijmegen ultra-sensitive Bethesda assay (NusBA) and the Nijmegen Bethesda assay (NBA). In total, 788 persons with hemophilia A (336 (42.6%) mild, 123 (15.6%) moderate, 329 (41.8%) severe hemophilia) were included. The median age was 45 years (IQR 24-60), and the majority (50.9%) had over 150 exposure days to FVIII concentrates. Within our population, 144 (18.3%) individuals had non-neutralizing FVIII-specific antibodies, 10 (1.3%) had very low-titer inhibitors (NusBA positive; NBA negative), and 13 (1.6%) had inhibitors (both NusBA and NBA positive). IgG1 was the most abundant FVIII-specific antibody subclass, and the highest titer levels were found for IgG4. In individuals without a reported history of inhibitor development, no clear differences were observed in antibody patterns between those who were minimally or highly exposed to FVIII concentrates. IgG4 subclass antibodies were only observed in persons with a reported history of FVIII inhibitor or in those with a currently detected (very low-titer) inhibitor. In this cross-sectional study, we identified non-neutralizing antibodies in a relatively large proportion of persons with hemophilia A. In contrast, in our population, consisting of persons highly exposed to FVIII concentrates, (very low-titer) inhibitors were detected only in a small proportion of persons, reflecting a well-tolerized population. Hence, our findings suggest that only a small subpopulation of non-neutralizing FVIII-specific antibodies is associated with clinically relevant inhibitors."

Evaluation of an in-house Luminex bead-based assay (LumiTope) compared with a commercially available ELISA and NBA. The LumiTope method comprised full-length and B-domain-deleted FVIII as well as 9 purified FVIII single or multidomains. The respective proteins were coupled to magnetic beads to detect domain-specific immunoglobulin (IgG; IgG<sub>1-4</sub>) anti-FVIII antibodies in a large cohort of patients with hemophilia A with and without inhibitors. Overall, LumiTope assay had a high sensitivity (94.9%) and specificity (91.2%), particularly in patients with low-titer inhibitors compared with ELISA (sensitivity of 72.2% vs 27.7%). IgG<sub>4</sub> was the most abundant IgG subclass in NBA-positive patients. NBA-positive and -negative patients showed different domain profiles. Patients with genetic variants in the heavy chain predominantly exhibited antibodies specific to this chain, while those with a light-chain variant showed a more diverse distribution of antibody specificities. Patients with an intron 22 inversion resembled those with a light-chain defect, with a majority of antibodies targeting the light chain. LumiTope assay provides a sensitive and specific method for not only detection but also domain specification of anti-FVIII-antibodies. Implementation of bead-based assays could improve antibody detection, profiling, and comparability of results and complement NBA."

Here, we describe the mechanisms of AAV vector persistence in the liver of a severe hemophilia A dog model (male = 4, hemizygous; and female = 4, homozygous), more than a decade after portal vein delivery. The predominant vector form was nonintegrated episomal structures with levels correlating with long-term transgene expression. Random integration was seen in all samples (median frequency, 9.3e-4 sites per cell), with small numbers of nonrandom common integration sites associated with open chromatin. No full-length integrated vectors were found, supporting predominant episomal vector-mediated long-term transgene expression. Despite integration, this was not associated with oncogene upregulation or histopathological evidence of tumorigenesis. These findings support the long-term safety of this therapeutic modality."

Currently employed AAV vectors may cause toxicity and adverse events. Furthermore, studies in animals do not fully predict risks and clinical benefits of AAV-based GT, and animal models reflecting the heterogeneity of certain clinical settings (e.g., congestive heart failure) are not widely available for improving AAV-based GT. Finally, antisense and gene editing approaches will soon complement gene augmentation strategies for the stable solution of unsolved issues of AAV-based GT. While minimizing toxicity, next-generation AAV vectors should decrease the viral load needed to achieve therapeutic efficacy, be functional in a restricted cellular subset, avoid transgene expression in unwanted cells (e.g., hepatocytes), and escape immune oversight in AAV-based GT. The role of stress-induced apoptosis in the loss of transgene expression in GT should also be explored. Aligning the interests and obligations of the pharmaceutical industry with those of the health system is critical for the success of AAV-based GT. Costs and challenges for the pharmaceutical industry include: a) removing impurities from AAV; b) validating tests to measure treatment efficacy; c) promoting training programs to standardize vector genome delivery; d) collecting long-term follow-up data; and e) maintaining sustainability and cost-effectiveness of AAV-based GT. In rare disorders with small patient numbers (e.g., hemophilia), clear-cut outcomes are mandatory as endpoints of unequivocal efficacy data."

During this treatment, the patient was hospitalized due to ankle joint bleeds and required hemostatic treatment, but the inhibitor disappeared and FVIII activity recovered to 30% after postoperative day 438 with cyclophosphamide. F8 analysis revealed the patient carried a heterozygosity of p.Arg391Cys, which has previously been categorized as cross-reacting material (CRM)-positive severe hemophilia A. No high-risk mutations for inhibitor development were found. We also report the results of a desmopressin acetate hydrate test administered to the patient to prepare for future treatment in case of hemorrhage, since high-dose FVIII administration may have been a factor in inhibitor development."

Bleeding events and articular non-bleeding events leading to hospitalization occurred in 15.4% and 13.9% of patients, respectively, and 9.9% of patients had surgeries or procedures related to haemophilic arthropathy. The mean (SD) FVIII product consumption was 344 (93) IU/kg/month for extended half-life treatment, and 331 (98) IU/kg/month for standard half-life products. For the sub-cohort of 146 patients, bleeding events (SD) decreased from 0.32 (2.2) to 0.09 (0.42) events/patient/year (<i>p</i> = 0.227) after switching to Elocta®. There was no statistically significant difference in rates of factor consumption or articular non-bleeding events before and after initiation of Elocta®. This study provides real-world insights that advance the understanding of treatment patterns and events of interest in patients with haemophilia A on prophylactic regimens in France."

    "title": "The role of microRNAs in defining LSECs cellular identity and in regulating <i>F8</i> gene expression.",
    "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII) plays a pivotal role in the coagulation cascade, and deficiencies in its levels, as seen in Hemophilia A, can lead to significant health implications. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the main producers and contributors of FVIII in blood, a fact we have previously elucidated through mRNA expression profiling when comparing these cells to other endothelial cell types. <b>Methods:</b> Our current investigation focuses on small microRNAs, analyzing their distinct expression patterns across various endothelial cells and hepatocytes. <b>Results:</b> The outcome of this exploration underscores the discernible microRNAs expression differences that set LSECs apart from both hepatocytes (193 microRNAs at <i>p</i> < 0.05) and other endothelial cells (72 microRNAs at <i>p</i> < 0.05). Notably, the 134 and 35 overexpressed microRNAs in LSECs compared to hepatocytes and other endothelial cells, respectively, shed light on the unique functions of LSECs in the liver. <b>Discussion:</b> Our investigation identified a panel of 10 microRNAs (miR-429, miR-200b-3p, miR-200a-3p, miR-216b-5p, miR-1185-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-30c-2-3p, and miR-30a-5p) that distinctly define LSEC identity. Furthermore, our scrutiny extended to microRNAs implicated in <i>F8</i> regulation, revealing a subset (miR-122-5p, miR-214-3p, miR-204-3p, and miR-2682-5p) whose expression intricately correlates with <i>F8</i> expression within LSECs. This microRNA cohort emerges as a crucial modulator of <i>F8</i>, both directly through suppression and indirect effects on established <i>F8</i>-related transcription factors. The above microRNAs emerged as potential targets for innovative therapies in Hemophilia A patients."

To assesses the test-retest reliability of PROBE when completed using the mobile phone application. We recruited PWH, including carriers, and individuals with no bleeding disorders who attended haemophilia-related workshops or via social media. Participants completed PROBE three times (twice on the app: T1 and T2, and once on the web, T3). Test-retest reliability was analysed for T1 versus T2 (app to app, time period one) and T2 versus T3 (app to web, time period two). We enrolled 48 participants (median age = 56 [range 27-78] years). Eighteen participants (37.5%) were PWH and seven (14.6%) were carriers. On general health domain questions, we found almost perfect agreement, except for a question on the frequency of use of pain medication in the last 12 months [Kappa coefficient (κ) .72 and .37 for time period one and two, respectively] and any use of pain medications (κ .75) for time period two. For haemophilia-related questions, we found substantial to perfect agreement, except for the questions on the number of joint bleeds in the previous 6 months for time period one (κ .49) and the number of bleeds in the previous two weeks for time period two (κ .34). The results demonstrate the reliability of the PROBE app. The app can be used interchangeably with the paper and web platforms for PROBE administration."

    "abstract": "Radiosynovectomy is an established treatment for chronic synovitis in patients with haemophilia. Although its role in rheumatological diseases has diminished, it remains an accepted therapy for haemophilic synovitis. The aim of this scoping review was to map and summarise the evidence surrounding radiosynovectomy in haemophilic knees, identify gaps in the literature and inform future research. Forty-three manuscripts and abstracts were identified for this review. Evidence was limited to observational studies and Yttrium-90 was the most studied licensed radioisotope. Radiosynovectomy was associated with a reduction in bleeding frequency and pain, improvements in range of motion and a reduction in the use of factor replacement. The literature reviewed lacks studies of sufficient methodological quality to permit systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic review using risk of bias assessment for observational studies should be undertaken to better evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiosynovectomy. A causal relationship between RSV and key clinical outcomes remains undetermined."

    "abstract": "Etranacogene dezaparvovec, the first gene therapy approved for haemophilia B treatment, was shown to be superior to treatment with continuous prophylactic factor IX in terms of bleeding protection 18 months after gene therapy in a phase 3 trial. We report post-hoc 24-month efficacy and safety data from this trial to evaluate the longer-term effects of etranacogene dezaparvovec in individuals with haemophilia B. The phase 3 HOPE-B trial enrolled males aged 18 years or older with inherited haemophilia B, classified as severe (plasma factor IX activity level <1%) or moderately severe (plasma factor IX activity level ≥1% and ≤2%), with a severe bleeding phenotype and who were on stable continuous factor IX prophylaxis. Participants were treated with a single infusion of etranacogene dezaparvovec (2 × 10<sup>13</sup> genome copies per kg of bodyweight). The primary endpoint, reported previously, was non-inferiority of the annualised bleeding rate (ABR) during the 52 weeks following stable factor IX expression (defined as months 7-18 after treatment) versus an at least 6-month lead-in period in which participants received their usual continuous factor IX prophylaxis, and is updated here up to month 24. Additional, post-hoc efficacy analyses, including adjusted ABR, factor IX activity, participants within factor IX ranges, and factor IX use, and safety analyses were performed at 24 months after gene therapy. Data were analysed in the full analysis set, which comprised the 54 patients who received at least a partial dose of gene therapy. The trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03569891. The study began on June 27, 2018, and participants were treated between January, 2019, and March, 2020; the date of data cutoff was April 21, 2022. 54 adult males (40 White, two Asian, one Black or African American, 11 other or missing) received a single intravenous infusion of etranacogene dezaparvovec and were followed for a median of 26·51 months (IQR 24·54-27·99), after a lead-in period of 7·13 months (6·51-7·82). In the updated analysis comparing months 7-24 after gene therapy to the lead-in period, mean adjusted ABR significantly reduced from 4·18 to 1·51 (p=0·0002) for all bleeds and from 3·65 to 0·99 (p=0·0001) for factor IX-treated bleeds. During each 6-month period after gene therapy, at least 67% of participants experienced no bleeding (36 of 54 during months 0-6 and stable thereafter), compared with 14 (26%) of 54 during the lead-in period. 24 months after gene therapy, 1 (2%) participant had one-stage factor IX activity less than 5%, whereas 18 (33%) had factor IX activity more than 40% (non-haemophilia range), with mean factor IX activity stable and sustained at 36·7% (SD 19·0%). 52 (96%) of 54 participants expressed endogenous factor IX, remaining free of factor IX prophylaxis at month 24. No new safety concerns were identified and no treatment-related serious adverse events or treatment-related deaths occurred. The most common treatment-related adverse events were an increase in alanine aminotransferase (nine [17%] of 54 patients), headache (eight [15%]), influenza-like illness (seven [13%]), and an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (five [9%]). By providing durable disease correction throughout the 24 months after gene therapy, etranacogene dezaparvovec provides a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia B. uniQure and CSL Behring."

To analyze the characteristics of AHA to enhance our understanding of this disease and identify effective treatment strategies. Clinical features of 165 patients with AHA from a single center between July 1997 and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 45 years. The median time to diagnosis was 30 days. All 165 patients experienced bleeding, with a median bleeding score (BS) of 4 (range, 2-12). Hemostatic therapy was administered to 129 (78.2%) patients. Bleeding control was achieved in 80.0% of patients who received prothrombin complex concentrate and in 92.3% of patients who were treated with recombinant activated FVII. Of the 163 patients who received immunosuppressive therapy, 80 (49.1%) received rituximab-based therapy with a 93.3% complete remission (CR) rate, 50 (30.7%) received steroids plus cyclophosphamide with an 85.0% CR rate, and 22 (13.5%) received steroids alone with an 82.4% CR rate. Six cases relapsed after a median duration of 330 days. Immunosuppressive therapy-related adverse events were reported in 17 patients. Seven deaths were recorded. FVIII inhibitor titer of ≥15 BU/mL and BS of ≥6 were identified as significantly poor prognostic factors for CR. Immunosuppressive therapies yield remarkably high response rates, with a CR rate exceeding 80%; notably, the regimen containing rituximab exhibits a CR rate of approximately 90%. FVIII inhibitor titer of ≥5 BU/mL and BS of ≥6 were poor predictors of CR in patients with AHA."

    "abstract": "Tolerance to self-proteins involves multiple mechanisms, including conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell (Tconv) deletion in the thymus and the recruitment of natural regulatory T cells (nTregs). The significant incidence of autoantibodies specific for the blood coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in healthy donors illustrates that tolerance to self-proteins is not always complete. In contrast to FVIII-specific Tconvs, FVIII-specific nTregs have never been revealed and characterized. To determine the frequency of FVIII-specific Tregs in human peripheral blood, we assessed the specificity of in vitro expanded Tregs by the membrane expression of the CD137 activation marker. Amplified Tregs maintain high levels of FOXP3 expression and exhibit almost complete demethylation of the FOXP3 Treg-specific demethylated region. The cells retained FOXP3 expression after long-term culture in vitro, strongly suggesting that FVIII-specific Tregs are derived from the thymus. From eleven healthy donors, we estimated the frequencies of FVIII-specific Tregs at 0.17 cells per million, which is about 10-fold lower than the frequency of FVIII-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells we previously published. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of FVIII tolerance by a renewed approach that could be extended to other self- or non-self-antigens."

The ability of certain agents to correct these parameters <i>in vitro</i> is associated with hemostatic efficacy <i>in vivo</i>. To compare effects of established and emerging hemostatic agents on clot formation and fibrinolysis in hemophilia A plasma. Pooled and individual hemophilia A platelet-poor plasmas were spiked with replacement (recombinant factor VIII [rFVIII], PEGylated rFVIII, polysialylated rFVIII, and porcine rFVIII) or bypassing (emicizumab, rFVIIa, and activated prothrombin complex concentrate) products. Effects on tissue factor-initiated clot formation and fibrinolysis were measured by turbidity. Compared to normal pooled plasma, hemophilia-pooled plasma showed reduced clot formation and increased fibrinolysis, and all replacement agents improved these characteristics. rFVIII and PEGylated rFVIII produced similar effects at similar concentrations, whereas polysialylated rFVIII produced slightly higher and porcine rFVIII slightly lower effects at these concentrations. Bypassing agents enhanced clot formation and stability, but patterns differed from replacement agents. The clotting rate showed a concentration-response relationship for all agents. High concentrations of all products produced effects that exceeded the normal range in at least some parameters. Responses of individual donors varied, but all agents improved clot formation and stability in all donors tested. Clotting and fibrinolysis assays reveal hemostatic effects of replacement and bypassing therapies at clinically relevant concentrations. These assays may help characterize hemostatic agents and optimize dosing."

    "title": "Bleeding Disorder of Unknown Cause: A Diagnosis of Exclusion.",
    "abstract": "Patients with an unexplained mild to moderate bleeding tendency are diagnosed with bleeding disorder of unknown cause (BDUC), a classification reached after ruling out other mild to moderate bleeding disorders (MBD) including von Willebrand disease (VWD), platelet function defects (PFDs), coagulation factor deficiencies (CFDs), and non-hemostatic causes for bleeding. This review outlines our diagnostic approach to BDUC, a diagnosis of exclusion, drawing on current guidelines and insights from the Vienna Bleeding Biobank (VIBB). According to guidelines, we diagnose VWD based on VWF antigen and/or activity levels ≤50 IU/dL, with repeated VWF testing if VWF levels are <80 IU/dL. This has been introduced in our clinical routine after our findings of diagnostically relevant fluctuations of VWF levels in a high proportion of MBD patients. PFDs are identified through repeated abnormalities in light transmission aggregometry (LTA), flow cytometric mepacrine fluorescence, and glycoprotein expression analysis. Nevertheless, we experience diagnostic challenges with regard to reproducibility and unspecific alterations of LTA. For factor (F) VIII and FIX deficiency, a cutoff of 50% is utilized to ensure detection of mild hemophilia A or B. We apply established cutoffs for other rare CFD being aware that these do not clearly reflect the causal role of the bleeding tendency. Investigations into very rare bleeding disorders due to hyperfibrinolysis or increase in natural anticoagulants are limited to cases with a notable family history or distinct bleeding phenotypes considering cost-effectiveness. While the pathogenesis of BDUC remains unknown, further explorations of this intriguing area may reveal new mechanisms and therapeutic targets."

    "title": "Non-clotting factor therapies for preventing bleeds in people with congenital hemophilia A or B.",
    "abstract": "Management of congenital hemophilia A and B is by prophylactic or on-demand replacement therapy with clotting factor concentrates. The effects of newer non-clotting factor therapies such as emicizumab, concizumab, marstacimab, and fitusiran compared with existing standards of care are yet to be systematically reviewed. To assess the effects (clinical, economic, patient-reported, and adverse outcomes) of non-clotting factor therapies for preventing bleeding and bleeding-related complications in people with congenital hemophilia A or B compared with prophylaxis with clotting factor therapies, bypassing agents, placebo, or no prophylaxis. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, electronic databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. The date of the last search was 16 August 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating people with congenital hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors, who were treated with non-clotting factor therapies to prevent bleeds. Two review authors independently reviewed studies for eligibility, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data for the primary outcomes (bleeding rates, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), adverse events) and secondary outcomes (joint health, pain scores, and economic outcomes). We assessed the mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) of effect estimates, and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Six RCTs (including 397 males aged 12 to 75 years) were eligible for inclusion. Prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy in people with inhibitors Four trials (189 participants) compared emicizumab, fitusiran, and concizumab with on-demand therapy in people with inhibitors. Prophylaxis using emicizumab likely reduced annualized bleeding rates (ABR) for all bleeds (MD -22.80, 95% CI -37.39 to -8.21), treated bleeds (MD -20.40, 95% CI -35.19 to -5.61), and annualized spontaneous bleeds (MD -15.50, 95% CI -24.06 to -6.94), but did not significantly reduce annualized joint and target joint bleeding rates (AjBR and AtjBR) (1 trial; 53 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Fitusiran also likely reduced ABR for all bleeds (MD -28.80, 95% CI -40.07 to -17.53), treated bleeds (MD -16.80, 95% CI -25.80 to -7.80), joint bleeds (MD -12.50, 95% CI -19.91 to -5.09), and spontaneous bleeds (MD -14.80, 95% CI -24.90 to -4.71; 1 trial; 57 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No evidence was available on the effect of bleed prophylaxis using fitusiran versus on-demand therapy on AtjBR. Concizumab may reduce ABR for all bleeds (MD -12.31, 95% CI -19.17 to -5.45), treated bleeds (MD -10.10, 95% CI -17.74 to -2.46), joint bleeds (MD -9.55, 95% CI -13.55 to -5.55), and spontaneous bleeds (MD -11.96, 95% CI -19.89 to -4.03; 2 trials; 78 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but not target joint bleeds (MD -1.00, 95% CI -3.26 to 1.26). Emicizumab prophylaxis resulted in an 11.31-fold increase, fitusiran in a 12.5-fold increase, and concizumab in a 1.59-fold increase in the proportion of participants with no bleeds. HRQoL measured using the Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults (Haem-A-QoL) physical and total health scores was improved with emicizumab, fitusiran, and concizumab prophylaxis (low-certainty evidence). Non-serious adverse events were higher with non-clotting factor therapies versus on-demand therapy, with injection site reactions being the most frequently reported adverse events. Transient antidrug antibodies were reported for fitusiran and concizumab. Prophylaxis versus on-demand therapy in people without inhibitors Two trials (208 participants) compared emicizumab and fitusiran with on-demand therapy in people without inhibitors. One trial assessed two doses of emicizumab (1.5 mg/kg weekly and 3.0 mg/kg bi-weekly). Fitusiran 80 mg monthly, emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg/week, and emicizumab 3.0 mg/kg bi-weekly all likely resulted in a large reduction in ABR for all bleeds, all treated bleeds, and joint bleeds. AtjBR was not reduced with either of the emicizumab dosing regimens. The effect of fitusiran prophylaxis on target joint bleeds was not assessed. Spontaneous bleeds were likely reduced with fitusiran (MD -20.21, 95% CI -32.12 to -8.30) and emicizumab 3.0 mg/kg bi-weekly (MD -15.30, 95% CI -30.46 to -0.14), but not with emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg/week (MD -14.60, 95% CI -29.78 to 0.58). The percentage of participants with zero bleeds was higher following emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg/week (50% versus 0%), emicizumab 3.0 mg/kg bi-weekly (40% versus 0%), and fitusiran prophylaxis (40% versus 5%) compared with on-demand therapy. Emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg/week did not improve Haem-A-QoL physical and total health scores, EQ-5D-5L VAS, or utility index scores (low-certainty evidence) when compared with on-demand therapy at 25 weeks. Emicizumab 3.0 mg/kg bi-weekly may improve HRQoL measured by the Haem-A-QoL physical health score (MD -15.97, 95% CI -29.14 to -2.80) and EQ-5D-5L VAS (MD 9.15, 95% CI 2.05 to 16.25; 1 trial; 43 participants; low-certainty evidence). Fitusiran may result in improved HRQoL shown as a reduction in Haem-A-QoL total score (MD -7.06, 95% CI -11.50 to -2.62) and physical health score (MD -19.75, 95% CI -25.76 to -11.94; 1 trial; 103 participants; low-certainty evidence). The risk of serious adverse events in participants without inhibitors also likely did not differ following prophylaxis with either emicizumab or fitusiran versus on-demand therapy (moderate-certainty evidence). Transient antidrug antibodies were reported in 4% (3/80) participants to fitusiran, with no observed effect on antithrombin lowering. A comparison of the different dosing regimens of emicizumab identified no differences in bleeding, safety, or patient-reported outcomes. No case of treatment-related cancer or mortality was reported in any study group. None of the included studies assessed our secondary outcomes of joint health, clinical joint function, and economic outcomes. None of the included studies evaluated marstacimab. Evidence from RCTs shows that prophylaxis using non-clotting factor therapies compared with on-demand treatment may reduce bleeding events, increase the percentage of individuals with zero bleeds, increase the incidence of non-serious adverse events, and improve HRQoL. Comparative assessments with other prophylaxis regimens, assessment of long-term joint outcomes, and assessment of economic outcomes will improve evidence-based decision-making for the use of these therapies in bleed prevention."

This is in contrast to the more common congenital haemophilias which are largely due to an absolute deficiency in coagulation factors. It has a prevalence of approximately one per million per year. However, this figure may be underestimated because there are many undocumented cases due to a lack of recognition. Patients who develop this disease may present with catastrophic bleeding despite having no previous bleeding history. In this study, we report a case of acquired Haemophilia A presenting with spontaneous unprovoked bruising and discuss the approach to diagnosis and how to alert the clinician to suspect this potentially rare but devastating disease."

The current study tried to provide a glimpse into the epidemiological and clinical status, as well as complications and treatment used for patients with hemophilia A in Karbala, Iraq. This retrospective research was carried out by reviewing the medical records of 90 male patients diagnosed with hemophilia A registered at the Hereditary Blood Disease Center in Karbala Teaching Hospital for children in Karbala, Iraq. The data was collected from May 10, 2023, until June 15, 2023, and included age, severity, type of bleeding, therapeutic approach, chronic viral infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The median age of the patients was 15 years (18.86±14.42). In this study, one-third of patients' presentations started in the first year of life. The most common type was severe hemophilia A (factor VIII activity < 1%). Consequently, more than half of the patients were treated with factor VIII concentrate. Four patients had hepatitis C, while HIV was confirmed in one patient. The epidemiological or clinical parameters of hemophilia A patients in Karbala seem similar to those in other cities in Iraq. By considering this preliminary data, further comprehensive studies for patients with hemophilia and associated complications in other provinces or cities in Iraq are highly suggested to provide a clear perspective about the prevalence and epidemiological burdens."

This observational study included patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A who were undergoing episodic FVIII replacement therapy. The primary endpoint was the difference in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) and the secondary endpoint was the difference in Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) before and after emicizumab prophylaxis. A total of 30 male hemophilia patients were included, the mean age was 16.7 (SD: ±8.1) years, and most of them had moderate hemophilia A [63.3%]. Before prophylaxis, the median ABR was 48 (interquartile range [IQR]: 35-60), and 93.3% of patients had ABR greater than eight, whereas after prophylaxis the median ABR decreased significantly (median [IQR]: 0 [0.0-0.4], <i>p</i> < 0.001), and 56.7% had zero bleeds. ABR was not significantly different in patient with and without FVIII inhibitors. The HJHS scores significantly improved after prophylaxis (10 vs. 2.5, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The bleeding events were reduced significantly (23 vs. 0.0, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and zero new target joints were reported after prophylaxis. Most of the patients [93.3%] did not face any serious adverse events after prophylaxis. Emicizumab prophylaxis was associated with a significantly lower rate of bleeding events among participants with hemophilia A, regardless of inhibitor status."

The study included 20 severe- and moderate-type right-dominant hemophilia patients diagnosed with hemophilia A-B and 20 healthy children. Viscoelastic properties (tone, stiffness, elasticity) of the lower-extremity muscles were measured using a MyotonPRO device. The physical characteristics of the pediatric hemophilia patients (mean age: 11.9 ± 3.95 years) and the control group (mean age: 12.6 ± 3.41 years) were found to be similar. A difference was observed only in the elasticity of the right vastus lateralis (<i>p</i> < 0.05) by means of the viscoelastic properties of the lower-extremity muscles. The results were similar in other muscle groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The dominant-side vastus lateralis muscle elasticity (the ability of the muscle to regain its original shape after contraction or removal of an external force) of hemophilia patients was found to be lower compared to healthy children. The fact that 45% of hemarthroses occur in the knee joint and that recurrent bleeding may affect the flexibility of the vastus lateralis, which is the main muscle within the quadriceps muscle group and responsible for the stabilization of the patella, can be associated with the study results."

    "abstract": "Relatively little is known about thrombotic adverse events (AEs) of emicizumab in postmarketing real-world settings, particularly in comparison with factor VIII (FVIII) products. A recent European study reported a potentially greater thrombotic risk of emicizumab compared with FVIII products. This drug safety study aims to investigate whether thrombotic AEs are more frequently reported for emicizumab than for FVIII products and if so, whether it is independent of bypassing agents as coreporting drugs using the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System data. Disproportionality analyses for thrombotic AEs of emicizumab vs FVIII products were conducted. Three signal detection indicators were used: proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and informational component (IC). During 2018-2022, the proportions of thrombotic AEs among all AEs were 4.07% (97 out of 2383) and 1.44% (134 out of 9324) for emicizumab and FVIII products, respectively: PRR = 2.83 (2.19-3.66), ROR = 2.91 (2.23-3.79), and IC = 1.04 (0.70-1.28). Bypassing agents as coreporting drugs were identified in 36% and 15% of the total thrombotic AE reports associated with emicizumab and FVIII products, respectively. Even after thrombotic AE reports with bypassing agents were excluded, the reporting proportion of thrombotic AEs was still greater for emicizumab than for FVIII products: PRR = 2.19 (1.60-2.99). Thrombotic AEs in the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System data were about 3 times more frequently reported for emicizumab than for FVIII products. More research and efforts in the future are warranted for monitoring, elucidating, and preventing the potential risk of thrombotic AEs in hemophilia therapy, including emicizumab."

    "title": "Innovative Therapies for Acquired Hemophilia A.",
    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune bleeding disorder which can be life-threatening. AHA is due to autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII. Disease onset may be idiopathic (approximately half of the cases) or triggered by autoimmune disorders, cancers, drugs, infections, or pregnancy. Besides treating the underlying disorder, specific AHA treatments include management of bleeding and inhibitor eradication. Various first-line and second-line hemostatic and immunosuppressive agents are currently available for the management of AHA. Recently, the hemostatic drug emicizumab and the immunosuppressive drug rituximab have been the object of intense research from investigators as innovative promising therapies for AHA. This narrative review will be focused on the current status of the clinical use of these two off-label therapeutic agents in AHA."

    "abstract": "Regular physical activity (PA) is recommended for patients with haemophilia (PwH). For PwH it is crucial to ensure a sufficient factor level to prevent PA-induced bleedings. However, there is a gap in the literature dealing with specific factor levels, which are needed when performing specific types of PA. To provide data on factor VIII (FVIII) levels at the start of PA performed by PwH. In this prospective 12-month real-world observational study, 23 PwH recorded every PA they performed and the FVIII levels at the start of the PA using a pharmacokinetic application. PA types were clustered according to the collision and injury risk into three categories (Cat I = low, Cat II = medium, Cat III = high risk). Haemophilia Joint Health Scores (HJHS) were performed at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. 795 PA sessions of Cat I, 193 of Cat II, and 23 of Cat III were documented. FVIII levels at the start of PA were different between categories (Cat I: 29.8 ± 32.1%, Cat II: 38.3 ± 33.4%, Cat III: 86.6 ± 29.2%). Out of all PA sessions, 145 (14%) were performed at a factor level of ≤3%. Three PA-induced bleeding occurred. Baseline HJHS was 14.5 ± 13.6 points and did not change throughout the study. This study provides real-life data on FVIII levels at the start of 1011 PA sessions. PwH are mainly active in low-risk sports with higher FVIII levels observed in Cat II and III, respectively. Only three PA-induced bleeding occurred, even though several PA were started with low FVIII levels."

    "abstract": "Antifibrinolytic drugs are used extensively for on-demand treatment of severe acute bleeding. Controlling fibrinolysis may also be an effective strategy to prevent or lessen chronic recurring bleeding in bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A (HA), but current antifibrinolytics have unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Here, we developed a long-lasting antifibrinolytic using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting plasminogen packaged in clinically used lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and tested it to determine whether reducing plasmin activity in animal models of HA could decrease bleeding frequency and severity. Treatment with the siRNA-carrying LNPs reduced circulating plasminogen and suppressed fibrinolysis in wild-type and HA mice and dogs. In HA mice, hemostatic efficacy depended on the injury model; plasminogen knockdown improved hemostasis after a saphenous vein injury but not tail vein transection injury, suggesting that saphenous vein injury is a murine bleeding model sensitive to the contribution of fibrinolysis. In dogs with HA, LNPs carrying siRNA targeting plasminogen were as effective at stabilizing clots as tranexamic acid, a clinical antifibrinolytic, and in a pilot study of two dogs with HA, the incidence of spontaneous or excess bleeding was reduced during 4 months of prolonged knockdown. Collectively, these data demonstrate that long-acting antifibrinolytic therapy can be achieved and that it provides hemostatic benefit in animal models of HA."

The development of a hemophilia-targeting quality of life scale is important for hemophiliacs and their treating physicians. Textual analysis. First, a review of studies on quality of life, hemophilia and related quality of life scales was conducted; Subsequently, two rounds of systematic searches of the Springer database were conducted to filter the literature on universal quality of life scale studies and hemophilia-targeting quality of life scale studies by title and abstract, and then textual analysis was performed. The former included 77,456 articles, 26,117 chapters and 7,086 related bibliographies, while the latter initially retrieved 211 entries articles, 118 chapters and 43 related bibliographies. Through filtering, the former contains 22 documents, yielding 1,431 valid word stems, and the latter contains 9 documents, yielding 1,541 valid word stems. While universal quality of life scales mostly fit into the broad framework of WHOQOL- BREF, the development of hemophilia-targeting quality of life scales inclines towards pains that patients suffer and technology advances in pharmaceutical. The current hemophilia QOL scales are mainly based on the HR-QoL, others mainly based on the HR-QoL as the master version. At the same time, the popularization of existing hemophilia quality of life scales in developing countries like China is not high, and the development of hemophilia quality of life scales is insufficient."

Their health-related quality of life (QoL) may be negatively impacted by insufficient treatment and bleed-related joint damage connected to a potentially delayed diagnosis. This study aims to gain information on the care reality and QoL of patients aged ≥12 years with mild hemophilia in Germany. An anonymous cross-sectional patient survey using standardized questionnaires was conducted in a validated electronic patient-reported outcome system. Medical specialists, hemophilia centers, patient organizations, and support groups across Germany invited the patients. A total of 43 patients (35 patients with hemophilia A, 5 patients with hemophilia B, and 3 patients for whom the information was missing) with a median age of 33 years were analyzed. The median age at diagnosis was 6.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-15.0), and the median factor activity was 14.0% (IQR 12.0-25.0). Nearly 85% of the patients received factor concentrates in the past, and the most common reasons for the treatment were surgery or joint bleeding (each 65.6%). Half of the patients who provided feedback experienced complications during bleeding episodes. Prophylactic treatment with factor concentrates was rare (10.3%). The patients had minor problems regarding their health status. Bleeding complications and joint bleeding, in particular, may be highly underestimated in patients with mild hemophilia, highlighting a medical need in this population. Patients with a potential benefit from prophylaxis need to be identified. Mild hemophilia has a negative impact on patients' QoL. Hemophilia centers satisfied the patients' needs. Further research is needed to address the current lack of awareness and improve adequate treatment in the future."

    "abstract": "The increased life expectancy of patients with haemophilia A (HA) has led to a growing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and events. There is still scarce evidence on the safety and appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in HA patients. We describe our experience on the clinical management of Italian HA patients after ACS. Nine patients with congenital HA treated with DAPT after a revascularization procedure performed for ACS have been enrolled and followed at the Angelo Bianchi Bonomi Haemophilia and Thrombosis Center in Milan between 2005 and September 2022. The safety and efficacy of DAPT with or without FVIII prophylaxis were assessed. Ten ACS events occurred in the nine HA patients (four mild and five severe). All events were treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with deployment of 1 to 3 drug-eluting stents followed by DAPT for 1-12 months. All patients except one were treated with FVIII prophylaxis during DAPT aimed at achieving FVIII trough levels ≥20-30 IU/dL. DAPT was effective in all cases in preventing early ACS recurrence, with only a late recurrence. We observed two clinically relevant non-major bleeds (one in a patient without FVIII prophylaxis) and three minor bleeds. No venous thrombosis occurred. The long-term secondary antithrombotic prevention consisting of DAPT and FVIII prophylaxis achieving a trough level of 20-30 IU/dL can be effective and safe in HA patients."

To review the efficacy and safety of established dental protocols that reduce factor use in the dental management of patients with haemophilia and to estimate cost savings. Records of 11 patients with haemophilia that were seen in the pilot programme period were reviewed. These were cross-referenced with previous dental and haematology notes that stated the amount and type of pre-operative factor used. Cost savings were estimated using the Australian National Blood Authority's Product List. All study participants were male, and included those with haemophilia A (n = 9), and B (n = 2). Mean age was 45 years (range 22-80). A variety of dental treatments were undertaken, and no pre-operative factor was used. Patients on prophylaxis (n = 6) received dental treatment the same day as their regular factor administration. It was estimated AUD$26,314 was saved by not using pre-operative factor. One patient had bleeding post-extraction and was seen the following day to achieve haemostasis using local measures. The remaining patients had no complaints of post-operative bleeding, and did not require any further haemostatic measures. This pilot programme supports data that haemophiliacs can safely receive a variety of dental treatments without the need for pre-operative factor, and the significant cost savings of doing so. Further data is required to support this protocol for invasive dental procedures."

A total of 130 participants with haemophilia A or B were included. They underwent various assessments, including joint health scoring (HJHS), functional tests (TUG and 2MWT) and completed questionnaires such as the BPI, IPAQ, HAL and ACTIVLIM-Hemo. Reliability indices and the minimum detectable change (MDC95) were determined for ACTIVLIM-Hemo and for HAL. Construct validity was evaluated through correlations and multiple linear regression, considering demographic and clinical factors. Both ACTIVLIM-Hemo (Person Separation Index = 0.92) and HAL (Cronbach's α = 0.98) demonstrated high reliability. The MDC95 for ACTIVLIM-Hemo represented 11.6% of its measurement range, while for HAL, it amounted to 18/100 score points. Activity limitations measured by both instruments were significantly correlated with demographic and clinical factors. Joint health (HJHS), pain severity (BPI) and walking performance (2MWT) emerged as the main predictors of activity limitations, explaining 75% of the variance in ACTIVLIM-Hemo and 60% in HAL. ACTIVLIM-Hemo stands as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing activity limitations in PwH. Both instruments exhibited significant correlations with demographic and clinical factors, but ACTIVLIM-Hemo displayed a more homogeneous construct. Given its linear scale and lower MDC95 and better targeting, ACTIVLIM-Hemo shows promise as a patient-centric instrument for assessing responsiveness to treatment during individual follow-up."

To analyse the outcomes and complications of arthroscopic ankle surgery performed on PWH. For this narrative review of the literature, a search was conducted in PubMed on 2, December 2023, using the keywords \"haemophilia\", \"ankle\" and \"arthroscopy\". Of the 29 articles identified, 15 specifically related to ankle arthroscopy in PWH were selected (inclusion criterion). The remaining articles did not meet this requirement (exclusion criterion) and were therefore eliminated. Arthroscopic procedures (arthroscopic synovectomy, debridement and arthrodesis of the ankle) are increasingly used in the surgical treatment of haemophilic ankle arthropathy. Although arthroscopic ankle surgery offers good outcomes in patients with haemophilia, the procedure is not free of complications, which range from 7.9% for arthroscopic ankle debridement to 13.1% in arthroscopic ankle synovectomy and 17.8% in arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis, respectively. The non-union rate of arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis is 7.1% (2/28). Although arthroscopic interventions in the haemophilic ankle (synovectomy, debridement, arthrodesis) offer good functional outcomes, they are associated with a non-negligible rate of complications. Arthroscopic ankle surgery in PWH is major surgery and should be treated as such."

This multicentre, non-interventional, post-marketing study recruited patients with haemophilia A who initiated treatment with turoctocog alfa from 18 sites (08/2014-12/2018). The primary endpoint was adverse events (AEs) during the 2-year study period. The safety and effectiveness analysis set included 39 patients. In total, 13 (33.3%) patients reported ≥1 AE; incidence rate was 60.4 events/100 patient-years of exposure (PYE). Treatment was withdrawn in two cases: pruritus in a PTP and factor VIII inhibitor development in a PUP. Inhibitor development occurred in 2.6% of all patients, with an incidence rate of 3.8 events/100 PYE. The rate of inhibitor development was 0%, 25% and 20% in PTPs, PUPs and PUPs with severe type, respectively. The haemostatic success rate was 91.4% for 383 bleeding episodes and 85.7% for 14 surgeries. The negative binomial annualised bleeding rate for the prophylaxis regimen was 6.19 episodes/year (95% CI, 3.69-10.38). The mean (SD) total consumption of turoctocog alfa (<i>n</i> = 34; excluding FVIII inhibitors) was 5,382.6 (7,180.1) IU/kg/year/patient; consumption was 4,133.1 (1,452.4) IU/kg/year/patient for prophylaxis. The effectiveness and safety profiles were comparable to those observed in other turoctocog alfa trials; effectiveness analysis and consumption were not affected by treatment regimens. Long-term use of turoctocog alfa therapy in clinical practice posed no newly identified safety issues and was effective for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in patients with haemophilia A in Japan."

    "abstract": "The hemophilias are the most common severe inherited bleeding disorders and are caused by deficiency of clotting factor (F) VIII (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B). The resultant bleeding predisposition significantly increases morbidity and mortality. The ability to improve the bleeding phenotype with modest increases in clotting factor levels has enabled the development and regulatory approval of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapies for people with hemophilia A and B. The canine hemophilia model has proven to be one of the best predictors of therapeutic response in humans. Here, we report long-term follow-up of 12 companion dogs with severe hemophilia that were treated in a real-world setting with AAV gene therapy. Despite more baseline bleeding than in research dogs, companion dogs demonstrated a 94% decrease in bleeding rates and 61% improvement in quality of life over a median of 4.1 years (range 2.6-8.9). No new anti-transgene immune responses were detected; one dog with a pre-existing anti-FVIII inhibitor achieved immune tolerance with gene therapy. Two dogs expressing 1%-5% FVIII post gene therapy experienced fatal bleeding events. These data suggest AAV liver-directed gene therapy is efficacious in a real-world setting but should target expression >5% and closely monitor those with levels in the 1%-5% range."

    "abstract": "In rare diseases, such as hemophilia A, the development of accurate population pharmacokinetic (PK) models is often hindered by the limited availability of data. Most PK models are specific to a single recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) concentrate or measurement assay, and are generally unsuited for answering counterfactual (\"what-if\") queries. Ideally, data from multiple hemophilia treatment centers are combined but this is generally difficult as patient data are kept private. In this work, we utilize causal inference techniques to produce a hybrid machine learning (ML) PK model that corrects for differences between rFVIII concentrates and measurement assays. Next, we augment this model with a generative model that can simulate realistic virtual patients as well as impute missing data. This model can be shared instead of actual patient data, resolving privacy issues. The hybrid ML-PK model was trained on chromogenic assay data of lonoctocog alfa and predictive performance was then evaluated on an external data set of patients who received octocog alfa with FVIII levels measured using the one-stage assay. The model presented higher accuracy compared with three previous PK models developed on data similar to the external data set (root mean squared error = 14.6 IU/dL vs. mean of 17.7 IU/dL). Finally, we show that the generative model can be used to accurately impute missing data (< 18% error). In conclusion, the proposed approach introduces interesting new possibilities for model development. In the context of rare disease, the introduction of generative models facilitates sharing of synthetic data, enabling the iterative improvement of population PK models."

Of the 711 patients in this analysis, 582 (82%) were receiving prophylaxis with octocog alfa at enrollment, and 498 (70%) had severe disease. Median Gilbert Scores were higher with on-demand therapy <i>versus</i> prophylaxis and scores were comparable in moderate and severe disease. In patients receiving prophylaxis, there was an improvement in HJHS Global Gait Score over 7 years of follow-up overall and in patients with severe disease. ABRs and annualized joint bleeding rates were low across all 7 years. An ABR of zero was reported in 34-56% of prophylaxis patients <i>versus</i> 20-40% in the on-demand group. ABRs were similar in severe and moderate disease. In total, 13/702 (1.9%) patients experienced 18 treatment-related adverse events. These data demonstrate the long-term effectiveness and safety of octocog alfa in patients with moderate and severe hemophilia A, especially in those receiving prophylaxis. The high number of patients receiving on-demand treatment experiencing zero bleeds could be due to selection bias within the study, with patients with less severe disease more likely to be receiving on-demand treatment.

However, thoroughly evaluating the safety and specificity of this therapy is essential. Our study introduces a novel methodology to analyze complex insertion sequences at the on-target edited locus, utilizing barcoded long-range PCR, CRISPR RNP-mediated deletion of unedited alleles, magnetic bead-based long amplicon enrichment, and nanopore sequencing. We identified the expected F8 insertions and various fragment combinations resulting from the in vivo linearization of the double-cut plasmid donor. Notably, our research is the first to document insertions exceeding ten kbp. We also found that a small proportion of these insertions were derived from sources other than donor plasmids, including Cas9-sgRNA plasmids, genomic DNA fragments, and LINE-1 elements. Our study presents a robust method for analyzing the complexity of on-target editing, particularly for in vivo long insertions, where donor template integration can be challenging. This work offers a new tool for quality control in gene editing outcomes and underscores the importance of detailed characterization of edited genomic sequences.

Ideally, an alternative dose adjustment can be based on the hemostatic potential, measured with a thrombin generation assay (TGA), like the Nijmegen hemostasis assay. The objective of this study was to investigate the predicted performance of a previously developed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for FVIII replacement therapy, relating FVIII dose and FVIII activity levels with thrombin and plasmin generation parameters. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements were obtained from 29 severe hemophilia A patients treated with pdVWF/FVIII concentrate (Haemate P<sup>®</sup>). The predictive performance of the previously developed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was evaluated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). When predictions of FVIII activity or TGA parameters were inadequate [median prediction error (MPE) > 20%], a new model was developed. The original pharmacokinetic model underestimated clearance and was refined based on a two-compartment model. The pharmacodynamic model displays no bias in the observed normalized thrombin peak height and normalized thrombin potential (MPE of 6.83% and 7.46%). After re-estimating pharmacodynamic parameters, EC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> values were relatively comparable between the original model and this group. Prediction of normalized plasmin peak height was inaccurate (MPE 58.9%). Our predictive performance displayed adequate thrombin pharmacodynamic predictions of the original model, but a new pharmacokinetic model was required. The pharmacodynamic model is not factor specific and applicable to multiple factor concentrates. A prospective study is needed to validate the impact of the FVIII dosing pharmacodynamic model on bleeding reduction in patients."

    "abstract": "Efanesoctocog alfa (Altuviiio,TM Sanofi-SOBI) is a B domain-deleted single-chain Factor VIII (FVIII) connected to D'D3 domain of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Its ingenious design allows efanesoctocog alfa to operate independently of endogenous vWF and results in an outstanding 3-4 times longer half-life compared to standard and extended half-life (EHL) FVIII products. The prolonged half-life ensures sustained high levels of factor activity, maintaining normal to near-normal ranges for the majority of the week, facilitating the convenience of once-weekly administration. Efanesoctocog alfa received regulatory approval in 2023 for application in both adults and children with inherited hemophilia A in the United States and Japan. Its sanctioned use encompasses both prophylaxis and 'on demand' treatment for bleeding episodes. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of Altuviiio. TM This comprehensive review focuses on the immunological profile of efanesoctocog alfa, a highly sophisticated new class of EHL FVIII molecule. The integration of the vWF D'D3 domain, XTEN polypeptides, and potential regulatory T-cell epitopes within various segments of efanesoctocog alfa collectively serves as a mitigating factor against the development of a neutralizing T-cell-mediated immune response. We hypothesize that such distinctive attribute may significantly reduce the risk of neutralizing antibodies, particularly in previously untreated patients. The discussion extends beyond regulatory approval to encompass the preclinical and clinical development of efanesoctocog alfa, including considerations for laboratory monitoring. The review also highlights areas that warrant further investigation to deepen our understanding of this groundbreaking therapeutic agent."

However, pre-existing immunity from wild-type AAV exposure impacts gene therapy eligibility. The aim of this multicenter epidemiologic study was to determine the prevalence and persistence of preexisting immunity against AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8, in adult participants with hemophilia A or B. Blood samples were collected at baseline and annually for ≤3 years at trial sites in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States. At baseline, AAV8, AAV2, and AAV5 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were present in 46.9%, 53.1%, and 53.4% of participants, respectively; these values remained stable at Years 1 and 2. Co-prevalence of NAbs to at least two serotypes and all three serotypes was present at baseline for ~40% and 38.2% of participants, respectively. For each serotype, ~10% of participants who tested negative for NAbs at baseline were seropositive at Year 1. At baseline, 38.3% of participants had detectable cell mediated immunity by ELISpot, although no correlations were observed with the humoral response. In conclusion, participants with hemophilia may have significant preexisting immunity to AAV capsids. Insights from this study may assist in understanding capsid-based immunity trends in participants considering AAV vector-based gene therapy."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> There is growing evidence of the relevance of designing organization of care around patient characteristics; this is especially true in the case of complex chronic diseases.<b>Purpose:</b> The goal of the paper - that focuses on the analysis of the clinical condition hemophilia in three different centers - is to address two different research questions:1. How can we define, within the same clinical condition, different patient profiles homogeneous in terms of intensity of service required (e.g. number of visits or diagnostics)? 2. What are the conditions to re-organize care around these patient profiles in a multidisciplinary and coordinated manner?<b>Research design:</b> The authors have used a multiple case study approach combining both qualitative and quantitative methodologies; in particularly the semi-structured interviews and the direct observation were aimed to map the process in order to come up with an estimate of the cost of the full cycle of care.<b>Study sample:</b> The research methodology has been applied consistently in three different centers. The selection of the structures has been based on two main different criteria: (i) high standards regarding both organizational and clinical aspects and (ii) willingness from management, nurses and physicians to provide data.<b>Results:</b> The study clearly shows that different patient profiles - within the same clinical condition - trigger a different set of diagnostic and therapeutic activities. It is, thus, important considering patient characteristics in the development and implementation of clinical pathways and this will imply relevant differences in terms of organizational and economic impact.<b>Conclusions:</b> These process-based analyses are very much critical especially if we want to move to a bundled and integrated payment system but, as shown by this study itself, require a lot of time and efforts since our healthcare information systems are still fragmented and vertically designed."

    "title": "The frequency of sarcopenia in haemophilia patients: Effects on musculoskeletal health and functional performance.",
    "abstract": "In patients with haemophilia A, chronic arthropathy develops over time as a result of recurrent joint bleeds, which leads to restricted mobility and disability in the affected joints. There are limited studies in the literature evaluating sarcopenia in patients with haemophilia. The present study aims to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in severe haemophilia-A patients and to evaluate musculoskeletal health and functional performance. Thirty haemophilia-A patients and 26 adult male volunteers were enrolled in the study. For detection of sarcopenia, the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup> ) to obtain the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) value. The thighs of both lower extremities were measured using the Modified Sonographic Tight Adjustment Ratio (STAR) method, which was obtained by adding the bilateral rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscle thicknesses measured by ultrasound. Hand and quadriceps muscle strength (MS) were measured with a dynamometer. Physical performance was determined using the walking speed (WS), timed up-and-go test (TUGT), 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (5RSTS), and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) and Haemophilia Early Arthropathy Detection-Ultrasonography (HEAD-US) were also used to assess the musculoskeletal system. According to the modified STAR values calculated based on body mass index, sarcopenia was present in 15 (50%) of 30 patients. However, based on the ASMI-BIA values, sarcopenia was present in only two (6.6%) patients. A weak correlation was found between ASMI and HJHS, HEAD-US, WS, TUGT, and hand MS (left), while a moderate correlation was found with knee MS (right), knee MS (left), and 5RSTS. A strong correlation was found between the modified STAR score and HEAD-US, HJHS, knee MS (left), 5RSTS, TUGT, and WS, while a moderate correlation was found with hand MS (left), hand MS (right), and knee MS (right). This study showed muscle loss, joint mobility restrictions, and decreased functional capacity in haemophilia patients and demonstrated the presence of sarcopenia in these patients. The STAR measurement method showed stronger relationships with MS and functional performance values than ASMI measurements in terms of evaluating sarcopenia."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A and B are one of the most common hereditary bleeding disorders. Patients are predisposed to bleeding spontaneously or after minor trauma in different areas such as the skin, gastrointestinal, or joints. COVID-19 infection has been associated with various clinical manifestations and complications including rarely triggering IgA vasculitis. We report a 23-year-old man who was previously diagnosed with severe hereditary hemophilia A. He presented to our hospital with classic symptoms of IgA vasculitis, complaining of petechiae and purpura in his limbs, fatigue, body aches, poor oral intake, abdominal pain, and watery non-bloody diarrhea. He did not present with respiratory symptoms or fever typical of COVID-19 infection. Abnormal blood tests were mildly elevated C-reactive protein, elevated d-dimers, and low Factor VIII activity. Extensive immunological tests were negative. CT abdomen with contrast was unremarkable. A skin biopsy strongly indicated IgA vasculitis. COVID-19 test came back positive. The patient was managed symptomatically and with glucocorticosteroids which significantly improved his symptoms. The available literature on clinical features, laboratory tests, and management of COVID-19-associated IgA vasculitis is discussed. However, there is no case reported on the associations between hemophilia, COVID-19 infection, and IgA vasculitis. This is the first case of atypical COVID-19 infection masquerading as de novo IgA vasculitis in an adult patient with underlying hemophilia. Our case contributes to the growing body of literature about hemophilia being a possible predisposing factor that a COVID-19 virus relies on to amplify immune dysregulation resulting in IgA vasculitis."

This study aims to analyse the morphological characteristics of the distal femur and patellofemoral joint in patients with haemophilia in comparison to normal healthy population. Study was conducted as pair-matched case-control study with 43 individuals in both the haemophilia group and the control group. Patellar luxation, patellar tilt (PT), length of the patella in both axis (pAP, pML), depth and angle of trochlear sulcus (SD, SA), lateral trochlear inclination (LTI), medial and lateral femoral facet length (mFL, LFL), intercondylar depth (ID), transepicondylar axis (TEA) and lateral condyle length (LCL) were assessed on knee MRI. Correlation between Pettersson score and measured variables were also analysed. PT was medial sided in 10 (23.2%) cases in haemophilic group. Mean values of pAP, pML, PT were significantly lower in haemophilia group (p < .001, p: .007, p = .001 respectively). There were no significant changes in SA (p = .628), SD (p = .340), LTI (p = .685), LFL (p = .241) and MFC-LFC (p = .770) whilst mFL was significantly longer in haemophilia group (p = .009). ID (p < .001), TEA (p = .007) and LCL (p = .001) were all shorter in haemophilia group. Pettersson score was inversely correlated with pAP, pML, ID, TEA, LCL, pML/SA and ID/LCL. Morphological changes in haemophilic arthropathy involve a smaller and medially-tilted patella, narrowed lateral condyle and transepicondylar axis, combined with reduced intercondylar depth. These alterations must keep in mind especially in pre- and intraoperative assessments for arthroplasty procedures."

Children (<18 years) with severe hemophilia A were enrolled. After three days' washout-period, blood samples were collected at pre-dose, 1 h, 3 h, 9 h, 24 h and 48 h post-infusion. At each timepoint, two 2 mL vacuum tubes with 3.2% trisodium citrate were used. The first tube was signed as 'non-standard' (NS) and the second tube was signed as 'standard' (S). FVIII activities were evaluated by one-stage assay. WAPPS-Hemo was used to generate PK profiles like half-life time (t<sub>1/2</sub>), clearance (CL), trough level and time to 1, 2 and 5IU/dL after a dose of 50 ± 10IU/dL. The FVIII activities at 9 h and 24 h post-infusion were put into WAPPS and thus brought four combinations by true or biased FVIII level that used. Compared with standard-collected blood samples, prolonged APTT results (<i>P</i>-values < 0.01) and decreased FVIII activity (<i>P</i>-values < 0.05) were revealed in those non-standard blood samples. The corresponding bias was in positive relation to both APTT-S (r = 0.44, <i>P </i>< 0.0001) and FVIII-S level(r = 0.68, <i>P </i>< 0.001). The FVIII bias percentage got larger as FVIII-S level reduced (r = -0.24, <i>P </i>< 0.01). During the four combinations of FVIII activity at 9 h and 24 h, statistically longer t<sub>1/2</sub>, lower CL and longer time to 1, 2 or 5IU/dL were observed in 9H-S&24H-S group and 9H-NS&24H-S group. While using vacuum tubes for clotting indicators and PK profiles, the dead space of blood sampling needle should be eliminated in advance."

However, there are limited data about the measurement of rpFVIII in the presence of emicizumab. To analyse whether rpFVIII can be measured with a chromogenic assay with bovine component (bCSA) in plasma from CHAwI on emicizumab treatment. In the first part of the study, FVIII deficient plasma was spiked with rpFVIII, in the second part, commercial plasma from CHAwI was spiked with emicizumab and rpFVIII, and in the third part, plasma from CHAwI on emicizumab treatment was spiked with rpFVIII. FVIII was then measured with bCSA and a chromogenic assay with human component (hCSA). Thrombin generation (TG) and clot-waveform analysis (CWA) were also carried out. The recovery of rpFVIII measured with bCSA is approximately 80% and is further influenced by the presence of an anti-porcine inhibitor. rpFVIII assessed with hCSA was influenced by emicizumab. CWA and TG showed a weak correlation with baseline emicizumab concentration, but peak thrombin and CWA correlated well with increasing emicizumab concentrations and rpFVIII activities. This study indicates that rpFVIII can be measured in the presence of emicizumab with a bCSA. A calibration curve for the measurement of rpFVIII with bCSA should be established."

To conduct systematically review whether bone mineral density (BMD) in PWH decreased and the factors affecting BMD. Two authors independently searched databases and reviewed citations from relevant articles, selecting studies published in any language and performed in humans before March 2023. Eligibility criteria were observational studies in PWH, with BMD as at least one outcome other than osteoporosis or bone loss, and analyses in a group of PWH and healthy controls. Twelve studies were ultimately identified, consisting of 1210 individuals (534 PWH and 676 healthy controls), compared with the control group, BMD in PWH decreased by 0.13 g/cm<sup>2</sup> [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.18 to -0.08, I<sup>2</sup> = 89%]. No evidence of publication bias was detected. There was no evidence that age, BMI, level of physical activity, the types of haemophilia, haemophilia severity, a blood-borne virus (HCV) and treatment modality predicted the BMD in PWH. The results indicate that BMD in PWH is lower than in healthy controls. Therefore, we strongly recommend PWH early measurement of BMD to prevent osteoporosis."

Combining both may reduce factor consumption, but its feasibility and safety has never been investigated. We assessed the feasibility and safety of combination treatment in nonsevere haemophilia A patients. Non-severe, desmopressin responsive, haemophilia A patients were included in one of two studies investigating peri-operative combination treatment. In the single-arm DAVID study intravenous desmopressin (0.3 μg/kg) once-a-day was, after sampling, immediately followed by PK-guided FVIII concentrate, for maximally three consecutive days. The Little DAVID study was a randomized trial in patients undergoing a minor medical procedure, whom received either PK-guided combination treatment (intervention arm) or PK-guided FVIII concentrate only (standard arm) up to 2 days. Dose predictions were considered accurate if the absolute difference between predicted and measured FVIII:C was ≤0.2 IU/mL. In total 32 patients (33 procedures) were included. In the DAVID study (n = 21), of the FVIII:C trough levels 73.7% (14/19) were predicted accurately on day 1 (D1), 76.5% (13/17) on D2. On D0, 61.9% (13/21) of peak FVIII:C levels predictions were accurate. In the Little DAVID study (n = 12), on D0 83.3% (5/6) FVIII:C peak levels for both study arms were predicted accurately. Combination treatment reduced preoperative FVIII concentrate use by 47% versus FVIII monotherapy. Desmopressin side effects were mild and transient. Two bleeds occurred, both despite FVIII:C > 1.00 IU/mL. Peri-operative combination treatment with desmopressin and PK-guided FVIII concentrate dosing in nonsevere haemophilia A is feasible, safe and reduces FVIII consumption."

We aimed to evaluate the genetic changes in Indian HA-patients that are associated with the development of inhibitors. All HA-patients with inhibitors who availed coagulation-laboratory services from January-2015 till December-2021 and had their samples preserved for DNA extraction were included in this study. An equal number of severity-matched HA patients without inhibitors were also included as controls. Intron 22 and intron 1 inversions in Factor VIII gene were identified using inverse-shifting-PCR. Inversion-negative patients were further assessed by targeted NGS, MLPA. Thirty HA-patients with inhibitors were identified. All had severe-HA. Thirty severe-HA-patients without inhibitors were also included as controls. Intron 22 inversion (63.3%) and large deletions (15%) were the commonest variants identified. There was no difference in genetic variants in patients with low and high titre inhibitors. A3, A2 and C2 were the most common domains involved in inversion-negative patients with inhibitors. However, there was no significant difference in domain involvement among inversion-negative patients with and without inhibitors. Seven novel-variants were identified, including three large deletions, one large duplication and two nonsense variants in inhibitor-positive patients, and one frameshift variant in inhibitor-negative patient. After adjusting for clinical risk-factors, large deletions were independently associated with the presence of inhibitors [aOR:6.1 (1.41-56.3)]. Intron 22 inversions are the commonest variant in Indian patients with severe-HA. Large deletions predispose to inhibitor development independent of clinical risk factors."

    "abstract": "Treating hemophilia A patients who develop inhibitors remains a clinical challenge. A mouse model of hemophilia A can be used to test the efficacy of strategies for inhibitor suppression, but the differences in the immune systems of mice and humans limit its utility. To address this shortcoming, we established a humanized NOD/SCID-IL2rγ<sup>null</sup> hemophilia A (hu-NSG-HA) mouse model with a severely deficient mouse immune system presenting a patient's adapted immune cells. Through intrasplenic injection with patient inhibitor-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), utilizing an adeno-associated viral delivery system expressing human BLyS, and regular FVIII challenge, human C19<sup>+</sup> B cells were expanded in vivo to secrete anti-FVIII antibodies. Both the inhibitor and the human anti-FVIII IgG, including the predominant subclasses (IgG1 and IgG4) present in the majority of inhibitor patients, were detected in the mouse model. We further segregated and expanded the different clones of human anti-FVIII-secreting cells through subsequent transplantation of splenocytes derived from hu-NSG-HA mice into another NSG-HA mouse. By transplanting a patient's PBMCs into the NSG-HA mouse model, we demonstrated the success of reintroducing a strong anti-FVIII immune response for a short period in mice with the immune systems of inhibitor-positive patients. Our results demonstrate a potential tool for directly obtaining functional human-derived antigen-specific antibodies and antibody-secreting cells, which may have therapeutic value for testing patient-specific immune responses to treatment options to assist in clinical decisions."

By testing a matrix of ultrasound-mediated gene delivery (UMGD) parameters for delivering a GFP plasmid into the livers of HA mice, we were able to define specific conditions for targeted gene delivery to different cell types in the liver. Subsequently, two conditions were selected for experiments to treat HA mice via UMGD of an endothelial-specific human FVIII plasmid: low energy (LE; 50 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 150 μs pulse duration) to predominantly target endothelial cells or high energy (HE; 110 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 150 μs pulse duration) to predominantly target hepatocytes. Both groups of UMGD-treated mice achieved persistent FVIII activity levels of ∼10% over 84 days post treatment; however, half of the HE-treated mice developed low-titer inhibitors while none of the LE mice did. Plasma transaminase levels and histological liver examinations revealed minimal transient liver damage that was lower in the LE group than in the HE group. These results indicate that UMGD can safely target LSECs with a lower-energy condition to achieve persistent FVIII gene expression, demonstrating that this novel technology is highly promising for therapeutic correction of HA."

To date, gene therapy has only been available in clinical trial settings, to PwH without pre-existing or historical factor inhibitors, significant concomitant liver damage or pre-existing neutralising antibodies to the adeno-associated viruses used to deliver the therapy. Thus, most PwH treated at centres not currently involved in gene therapy trials, either as a referral/follow-up centre or as a dosing centre, have been unable to access the therapy. This Exigency sub-study aims to gain a greater understanding of the opinions of PwH in the United Kingdom who have not had access to gene therapy: asking what they understand, what concerns they have, and whether they perceive any barriers preventing their access to gene therapy. Twenty-three PwH were approached; 14 consented, and one withdrew prior to interview. The mean age of the participants was 35.7 years (range 25-74 years). Eleven had haemophilia A and two haemophilia B. Two were treated with standard half-life factor products, five with extended half-life products, five with a FVIII mimetic and one with a clinical trial product. One family member (a participant's partner) was also interviewed. The participants identified four barriers to gene therapy: concerns about the process of gene therapy (Expectations), uncertainty about the results (outcomes), (Access) to treatment, and a lack of understanding about gene therapy (education). This Exigency study subgroup sees gene therapy as a positive treatment development that promises an improved quality of life. For this participant group, four issues impact their decision to undergo gene therapy. If the promise of gene therapy is to be realised, these barriers need to be acknowledged and addressed by healthcare professionals, patient organisations, and gene therapy providers."

To date, no studies have shown the origin and timing of HA sporadic noninversion variants (NIVs); herein, we assume that HA-sporadic NIVs are generated as a de novo variant. Of the 125 registered families with HA, 22 were eligible for inclusion. We conducted a linkage analysis using <i>F8</i> gene markers and amplification refractory mutation system-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to confirm the origin of the sporadic NIVs (~0% mutant cells) or the presence of a mosaic variant, which requires further confirmation of the origin in the parent. Nine mothers, four maternal grandmothers, and six maternal grandfathers were confirmed to be the origin of sporadic NIVs, which most likely occurred in the zygote within the first few cell divisions and in single sperm cells, respectively. Three mothers had mosaic variants, which most likely occurred early in postzygotic embryogenesis. All maternal grandparents were free from sporadic NIV. In conclusion, <i>F8</i> NIVs in sporadic HA were found to be caused primarily by de novo variants. Our studies are essential for understanding the genetic pathogenesis of HA and improving current genetic counseling."

Among the various SRs expressed by LSECs is stabilin-2 (STAB2), a class H SR that binds to several ligands, among which endogenous coagulation products. Given the well-established tolerogenic function of LSECs, we asked whether the STAB2 promoter (STAB2p) would enable us to achieve LSEC-specific lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated transgene expression, and whether the expression of this transgene would be maintained over the long term due to tolerance induction. Here, we show that STAB2p ensures LSEC-specific green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by LV in the absence of a specific cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune response, even in the presence of GFP-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, confirming the robust tolerogenic function of LSECs. Finally, we show that our delivery system can partially and permanently restore FVIII activity in a mouse model of severe hemophilia A without the formation of anti-FVIII antibodies. Overall, our findings establish the suitability of STAB2p for long-term LSEC-restricted expression of therapeutic proteins, such as FVIII, or to achieve antigen-specific immune tolerance in auto-immune diseases."

Patients require lifelong treatment and it is costly, but there is a lack of research in China on the treatment and burden for this group. Our aim was to review the actual treatment pattern of hemophilia B patients in China, and describe the financial burden and other disease burden from the patient's perspective. Using data collected by the Beijing Hemophilia Home Care Center, descriptive statistics were made on the sociodemographic characteristics and treatment of patients. The annual drug costs were calculated according to the actual factor dosage and price. During the study period, 29.9% of the patients only received on-demand treatment, while the rest of the patients received varying numbers of prophylaxis treatment. The total cost of clotting factors for 341 patients in one year was 16.0 million CNY ($2.5 million), with 46990.8 CNY ($7283.7) per patient. The drug cost of prophylaxis was significantly higher than that of on-demand treatment. The amount of prothrombin complex concentrates used by patients was the largest, more than 5 times of recombinant coagulation factor IX. Based on the average annual wage and average working time of Chinese employees in 2021, the average annual wage loss of HB patients reached 31544.2 CNY ($4889.4). The results of the questionnaire showed that 77.1% and 65.3% of patients had chronic pain and acute pain of different frequencies. The level of prophylaxis for Chinese patients is low; safer and more effective recombinant drugs are not widely available. Patients also face a high burden of drug costs, as well as indirect costs that cannot be underestimated. Therefore, continued efforts are needed to improve the quality of life of patients by reducing their financial burden and promote standardized treatment."

In addition, joint ultrasound allows the evaluation of the severity of hemophilic arthropathy in terms of synovitis and cartilage and bone damage. However, a lack of standardization in the definition of ultrasound elementary lesions of hemophilic arthropathy may lead to confusion and an incorrect evaluation of the presence and progression of joint damage.

To design a new rFVII with lower coagulant activity that could potentially be used as an alternative hemostatic agent aiming to minimize the risk of thrombogenicity. D60A was introduced into the <i>F7</i> sequence by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Wild type (WT) and D60A were generated in human embryonic kidney 293T cells by stable transfection. FVII coagulant activities were determined by amidolytic cleavage of the FVIIa-specific substrate, 2-step FXa generation, thrombin generation (TG), and clot-based assays. WT and D60A demonstrated similar FVIIa amidolytic activity. However, D60A showed approximately 50% activity on FX activation and significantly longer lag time in the TG assay than that shown by WT. The clotting time produced by D60A spiked in FVII-deficient plasma was significantly prolonged than that of WT. Additionally, the <i>ex vivo</i> plasma half-lives of WT and D60A were comparable. D60A demonstrated lower coagulant activities, most likely due to the weakening of FX binding, leading to impaired FX activation and delayed TG and fibrin formation. Considering that a plasma FVII level of 15% to 25% is adequate for normal hemostasis, D60A is a molecule of interest for future development of an rFVII with a lesser extent of thrombogenicity."

This phase 3, multicentre, single-arm, open-label study (NCT02895945) enrolled males aged 12-75 years with severe/moderately severe CHAWI who required surgical/invasive procedures. Patients received a loading dose of rpFVIII 1-2 h before surgery. The primary outcome was the proportion of all procedures with a 'good' or 'excellent' response (treatment success) on the global haemostatic efficacy assessment score. Of the eight dosed patients, five completed the study. Six of seven surgeries (85.7%; 95% confidence interval, 42.1-99.6) achieved treatment success; five were rated 'excellent', one was rated 'good'. Seven surgery-related bleeding episodes occurred in three patients during the study, with none requiring additional surgical intervention. Overall, six of eight patients experienced 17 treatment-emergent adverse events. Three patients developed de novo inhibitors to rpFVIII. Five patients reported anamnestic reactions, three to both human (h) FVIII (i.e., alloantibodies to exogenous FVIII detected with anti-hFVIII assays) and rpFVIII, and two to hFVIII only. Four serious adverse events were considered related to rpFVIII (three anti-rpFVIII antibody positive; one anamnestic reaction to hFVIII and rpFVIII). Good haemostasis was achieved with rpFVIII during the immediate perioperative period. The study was terminated early because the study sponsor and health authorities determined that the risk of anamnestic reactions outweighs the benefits in this study population."

    "abstract": "Valoctocogene roxaparvovec uses an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) vector to transfer a factor VIII (FVIII) coding sequence to individuals with severe haemophilia A, providing bleeding protection. To assess safety and efficacy of valoctocogene roxaparvovec 5-6 years post-treatment. In a phase 1/2 trial, adult male participants with severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤1 IU/dL) without FVIII inhibitors or anti-AAV5 antibodies received valoctocogene roxaparvovec and were followed for 6 (6 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg; n = 7) and 5 (4 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg; n = 6) years. Safety, including investigation of potential associations between a malignancy and gene therapy, and efficacy are reported. No new treatment-related safety signals emerged. During year 6, a participant in the 6 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg cohort was diagnosed with grade 2 parotid gland acinar cell carcinoma; definitive treatment was uncomplicated parotidectomy with lymph node dissection. Target enrichment sequencing of tumour and adjacent healthy tissue revealed low vector integration (8.25 × 10<sup>-5</sup> per diploid cell). Integrations were not elevated in tumour samples, no insertions appeared to drive tumorigenesis, and no clonal expansion of integration-containing cells occurred. During all follow-ups, >90% decreases from baseline in annualised treated bleeds and FVIII infusion rates were maintained. At the end of years 6 and 5, mean FVIII activity (chromogenic assay) was 9.8 IU/dL (median, 5.6 IU/dL) and 7.6 IU/dL (median, 7.1 IU/dL) for the 6 × 10<sup>13</sup> and 4 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/kg cohorts, respectively, representing proportionally smaller year-over-year declines than earlier timepoints. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec safety and efficacy profiles remain largely unchanged; genomic investigations showed no association with a parotid tumour."

    "abstract": "Eptacog beta (activated), a recombinant human factor VIIa (rFVIIa), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020 (SEVENFACT®, LFB & HEMA Biologics) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022 (CEVENFACTA®, LFB). In Europe, eptacog beta is indicated for the treatment of bleeds and the prevention of bleeds during surgery or invasive procedures in adults and adolescents (≥12 years old) with congenital haemophilia A or B with high-titre inhibitors (≥5 BU) or with low-titre inhibitors who are expected to have a high anamnestic response to factor VIII or factor IX, or to be refractory to increased dosing of these factors. The efficacy and safety of eptacog beta were evaluated in three Phase III clinical studies, PERSEPT 1, 2 and 3. For the EMA filing dossier, the analysis of data from PERSEPT 1 and 2 differed from the analysis used to support the filing in the US. In this review, we summarise current data regarding the mode of action, clinical efficacy and safety of eptacog beta for the management of haemophilia A and B in patients with inhibitors from a European perspective. In addition to providing a valuable summary of the analyses of the clinical data for eptacog beta conducted for the EMA, our review summarises the potential differentiators for eptacog beta compared with other current bypassing agents."

    "abstract": "Bleeding disorders (BDs) may influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and caregivers. Measuring HRQoL gives insight into domains requiring support and provides an opportunity to evaluate the effects of novel therapies. To gain insight in the current body of literature on HRQoL in children with BDs in order to identify knowledge gaps for research and further development of this field. Scoping review. We included 53 articles, describing studies mainly performed in Europe and North-America (60.4%) and mostly within the last ten years. Only 32% studies included children <4 years. Almost all studies (47/53, 88.7%) were performed in boys with haemophilia, pooling haemophilia A and B (n = 21) and different disease severities (n = 20). Thirteen different generic and five disease-specific HRQoL-questionnaires were applied; all questionnaires were validated for haemophilia specifically. Six (11,3%) combined generic and disease-specific questionnaires. Self-reports were most frequently applied (40/53, 75.5%), sometimes combined with proxy and/or parent-reports (17/53, 32.1%). Eleven studies used a reference group (20.8%). Statistical analyses mostly consisted of mean and SD (77.4%). HRQoL-research is mainly performed in school-aged boys with haemophilia, treated in developed countries. Pitfalls encountered are the pooling of various BDs, subtypes and severities, as well as the application of multiple generic questionnaires prohibiting comparison of results. More attention is needed for broader study populations including other BDs, young children, feminine bleeding issues and platelet disorders, as well as the use of HRQoL as an effect-measurement tool for medical interventions, and more thorough statistical analysis."

    "abstract": "Considering the advances in haemophilia management and treatment observed in the last decades, a new set of value-based outcome indicators is needed to assess the quality of care and the impact of these medical innovations. The Value-Based Healthcare in Haemophilia project aimed to define a set of clinical outcome indicators (COIs) and patient-reported outcome indicators (PROIs) to assess quality of care in haemophilia in high-income countries with a value-based approach to inform and guide the decision-making process. A Value-based healthcare approach based on the available literature, current guidelines and the involvement of a multidisciplinary group of experts was applied to generate a set of indicators to assess the quality of care of haemophilia. A final list of three COIs and five PROIs was created and validated. The identified COIs focus on two domains: musculoskeletal health and function, and safety. The identified PROIs cover five domains: bleeding frequency, pain, mobility and physical activities, Health-Related Quality of Life and satisfaction. Finally, two composite outcomes, one based on COIs, and one based on PROIs, were proposed as synthetic outcome indicators of quality of care. The presented standard set of health outcome indicators provides the basis for harmonised longitudinal and cross-sectional monitoring and comparison. The implementation of this value-based approach would enable a more robust assessment of quality of care in haemophilia, within a framework of continuous treatment improvements with potential added value for patients. Moreover, proposed COIs and PROIs should be reviewed and updated routinely."

It has been shown that prophylaxis regulated with pharmacokinetic (PK) data reduces frequency of bleeding and cost of treatment. To determine the best prophylaxis regimen, PK dosing tools using the Bayesian method have been developed. We aimed to compare two PK dosing tools. Blood samples were drawn before, 4, 24, and 48 h after FVIII infusions from patients with severe hemophilia A and inhibitor negative. FVIII levels were measured by PTT-based one-stage assay method. PK parameters obtained using WAPPS and myPKFiT, which are web-accessible PK dosing tools using Bayesian algorithm, and daily prophylaxis dose estimated by the programs were compared. Forty-two hemophilia A patients [median age 13 years (IQR 8.9-16.4)] included in the study. There was no difference between the daily dose of FVIII given for prophylaxis and the dose recommended by the myPKFiT for the 1% trough level; whereas, a significant difference was found with the WAPPS. The half-lives of FVIII did not differ between the two dosing tools; however, significant differences were found in the estimated dose, clearances, and times to 1% trough level. There was no significant difference between PK data of patients who received Advate® and those who received non-Advate® factor concentrates. Choice of PK dosing tool can affect recommended FVIII dose. However, target trough levels should be individualized according to bleeding phenotype and daily activity of patient.

    "abstract": "To investigate the risk factors of FVIII inhibitors development in severe hemophilia A (HA) patients who were received on-demand therapy and were infused with plasma cryoprecipitate and multiple FVIII concentrates alternately. We collected clinical information from 43 severe HA children who were treated with plasma cryoprecipitate and multiple FVIII concentrates. The F8 mutation was detected by long-distance PCR for inversion and detected by all exons and their flanking sequencing for other mutations. The inhibitor detection was performed by Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay. The impact of novel amino substitutions on FVIII protein was predicted by SIFT and PolyPhen-2. The 3D analysis of missense mutations was performed using Swiss-PdbViewer. FVIII inhibitors were detected in nine cases (20.9%). All of the inhibitor positive cases had high risk F8 gene mutations. In most of the positive cases (7/9), inhibitors were developed during the first 10 EDs, which was significantly higher than that in the 10-50 EDs group and 50 EDs group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Three novel mutations were reported, including c.214G > T (E72X), c.218 T > C (F73S), and c.2690C > G (S840X). For severe HA patients who are treated with multiple products of replacement therapy, it is important to supervise inhibitor during the first 10EDs, especially for those with high risk F8 gene mutations. F8 gene mutation is one of the most important genetic factors for inhibitor development. It is essential to detect F8 gene for all severe HA patients. Three novel mutations were reported to expand the mutation spectrum of the F8 gene."

    "abstract": "Revolutionary advances in the treatment of hemophilia has led to a significant improvement in life expectancy. Associated with this has been an increase in age-related diseases especially atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). While people with hemophilia (PWH) develop atherosclerosis at rates similar to those of the general population, rates of atherothrombosis and mortality related to CVD have been much lower, due to their hypocoagulable state. Changing treatment paradigms, aimed at reducing the risk of bleeding by improving hemostasis to levels approaching normality, has meant that the protection they are thought to have had may be lost. CVD risk factors are just as common in PWH as in the general population, but appear to be undertreated. In particular, primary prevention of CVD is vital in all individuals, but particularly in PWH as treatment of established CVD can be difficult. Active identification and management of CVD risk factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, is required. In particular, statins have been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with few adverse events and no increased risk of bleeding in the general population, and their use needs urgent assessment in PWH. Further longitudinal research into preventing CVD in PWH, including accurate CVD risk assessment, is required to optimize prevention and management."

Mean age at diagnosis was 4.1 years. The diagnostic process was somewhat/very difficult for 23% of patients and 26% of caregivers. Approximately half (53%) received single factor replacement (SFR) as prophylaxis or on-demand. Most patients (71%) reported regular prophylaxis treatment. Over one-fourth (27%) reported treatment with fresh frozen plasma. Bleeding episodes were less common in patients using SFR versus non-SFR: three bleeds or fewer were reported by 92% SFR and 75% non-SFR patients. HFXD patients reported low well being in work/school/social activities with mean HFXD-adapted Hemophilia Well being Index. Patient symptoms negatively impacted caregiver burden with a mean HFXD-adapted Hemophilia Caregiver Index (±SD) of 15.9 (4.6), but also unexpectedly had a positive impact on self-worth and inner strength.To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess patient and caregiver burden of HFXD and impact on QoL. Improvements in symptom recognition, prompt diagnosis, and adherence to expert recommendations for treatment could improve QoL and decrease burden on HFXD patients and caregivers."

    "abstract": "Emicizumab is used as a subcutaneous prophylaxis for prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (HA) with and without inhibitors. While low bleeding rates were observed in clinical trials, patients still experience breakthrough bleeds (BTBs) with emicizumab in the real-world. Current guidelines recommend use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for treatment of BTBs in patients with inhibitors. Due to thrombotic events observed in the HAVEN 1 study, activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) should be used with caution. The objective of this review is to identify and discuss real-world data on the frequency of BTBs and the safety of concomitant rFVIIa use in patients with inhibitors on emicizumab prophylaxis. A search of the following databases was conducted on 15 July 2022: BIOSIS Previews<sup>®</sup> , Current Contents Search<sup>®</sup> , Embase<sup>®</sup> , MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> . Search terms included 'real world', 'haemophilia A', and 'emicizumab'. Eleven relevant publications were identified (seven original research articles and four congress abstracts). The frequency of BTBs specifically for HA patients with inhibitors was described in three publications with 5%-56% patients on emicizumab reporting ≥1 bleeding episode. Treatment of these BTBs appeared to be managed according to relevant guidelines. Importantly, no thrombotic complications occurred during concomitant rFVIIa use. Due to the nature of real-world studies, direct comparison of the results between studies is limited. However, real-world data show that BTBs in inhibitor patients during emicizumab prophylaxis can be safely treated with rFVIIa."

    "abstract": "Gene therapy for hemophilia has advanced tremendously after thirty years of continual study and development. Advancements in medical science have facilitated attaining normal levels of Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX) in individuals with haemophilia, thereby offering the potential for their complete recovery. Despite the notable advancements in various countries, there is significant scope for further enhancement in haemophilia gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) currently serves as the primary vehicle for gene therapy in clinical trials targeting haemophilia. Subsequent investigations will prioritize enhancing viral capsid structures, transgene compositions, and promoters to achieve heightened transduction efficacy, diminished immunogenicity, and more predictable therapeutic results. The present study indicates that whereas animal models have transduction efficiency that is over 100% high, human hepatocytes are unable to express clotting factors and transduction efficiency to comparable levels. According to the current study, achieving high transduction efficiency and high levels of clotting factor expression in human hepatocytes is still insufficient. It is also crucial to reduce the risk of cellular stress caused by protein overload. Despite encountering various hurdles, the field of haemophilia gene therapy holds promise for the future. As technology continues to advance and mature, it is anticipated that a personalized therapeutic approach will be developed to cure haemophilia effectively."

The efficacy and safety of emicizumab were demonstrated in 4 phase III clinical trials (HAVEN 1-4). Here, we describe pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics (PDs), and exploratory safety biomarkers in HAVEN 1 to 4. Participants received emicizumab at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg weekly, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks. PKs, PDs, and safety biomarkers were assessed in samples collected at regular intervals during the trials. Emicizumab plasma trough concentrations increased during the loading dose period, reaching a mean of 52.9 μg/mL (SD, 13.6 μg/mL) at week 5, and were sustained at 42.1 to 52.3 μg/mL thereafter with maintenance dosing. Activated partial thromboplastin time shortened following the first emicizumab dose. Mean FVIII-like activity and thrombin generation peak height increased to 25.2 IU/dL (SD, 6.9 IU/dL) and 115.2 nM (SD, 42.5 nM) at week 5, with levels sustained at 17 to 23 IU/dL and >116 nM thereafter, respectively. Emicizumab did not notably affect FIX or FX plasma antigen levels, prothrombin time, or concentrations of exploratory safety markers of coagulation activation (D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, and fibrinogen). In HAVEN 1 to 4, emicizumab demonstrated sustained PKs and PDs and improved coagulation parameters without affecting safety biomarkers."

A post hoc comparative analysis of the joint status of patients with severe haemophilia A (HA) or B (HB) was performed. The databases of two observational, cross-sectional studies that recruited patients with HA or HB from 12 Spanish centres were analysed to compare the status of the elbows, knees and ankles in patients with severe disease according to treatment modality. The HEAD-US score was calculated in both studies by the same trained operators. Overall, 95 HA and 41 HB severe patients were included, with a mean age of 35.2 ± 11.8 and 32.7 ± 14.2 years, respectively. The percentage of patients who received prophylaxis, over on-demand (OD) treatment, was much higher in HA (91.6%) than in HB (65.8%) patients. With a similar number of target joints, the HEAD-US score was zero in 6.3% HA and 22.0% HB patients (p < .01), respectively. The HA population showed significantly worse HEAD-US scores. Whilst osteochondral damage occurred more frequently in patients OD or tertiary prophylaxis, our data suggest that articular damage is less prominent in primary/secondary prophylaxis, regardless of the type of haemophilia. These latter treatment modalities were also associated with a lower prevalence of synovial hypertrophy, particularly in HB patients. This post hoc analysis indicates that joint status seems to be significantly influenced by haemophilia type (HA or HB) and treatment modality in these severe Spanish populations with severe disease. Continuing HEAD-US monitoring for the early detection and management of intra-articular abnormalities, as well as more efficiently tailored therapies should be warranted."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia is a serious X-linked inheritance coagulation factor deficiency. Clinically, prolonged bleeding or delayed clotting in any area of vascular disturbance is the main manifestation of all hemophilia. We presented a 23-year-old male with a history of left sensory esotropia since the age of three. The patient had not undergone any previous eye surgery and refused to wear glasses. Hematologic studies confirmed a diagnosis of hemophilia A. Upon ophthalmologic examination, the patient's visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/120 in the left eye, with deep amblyopia. The patient exhibited left inferior oblique overaction and a V pattern. The ophthalmologic examination otherwise revealed no abnormalities. Preoperative correction of factor VIII was deemed necessary, and the recommended dose was administered to raise the factor VIII level to 52%. The patient underwent bilateral medial rectus recession, left lateral rectus plication, and left inferior oblique myectomy. A new technique utilizing viscodissection with subconjunctival injection of a viscoelastic solution was employed to minimize intraoperative bleeding, resulting in reduced bleeding compared to standard strabismus surgery. No unusual bleeding occurred during the procedure. No postoperative bleeding was observed. The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day, having achieved satisfactory cosmetic alignment in the primary position with no complications related to hemophilia. In conclusion, strabismus surgery can be performed safely in strabismic patients with hemophilia. Viscodissection is a helpful novel surgical technique to decrease the risk of bleeding during surgery, and we recommend using this technique in patients using anticoagulants. A multidisciplinary team approach and strict post-operative monitoring are essential in order to achieve optimal results."

To identify the trend in PPH in the last decade, assess the impact of bleeding disorders on pregnancy outcomes and evaluate their coagulation workup during pregnancy. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using the Alberta Pregnancy Birth Cohort from 2010 to 2018. We included women with von Willebrand disease (VWD) and haemophilia, identified by previously validated algorithm and matched with controls. Logistic regression was used to compute odds of PPH and other pregnancy outcomes. We identified 311,330 women with a total of 454,400 pregnancies with live births. The rate of PPH did not change significantly from 10.13 per 100 deliveries (95% CI 10.10-10.16) in 2010-10.72 (95% CI 10.69-10.75) in 2018 (p for trend = .35). Women with bleeding disorders were significantly more likely to experience PPH (odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95% CI 1.5-3.6), antepartum haemorrhage (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.5-5.9) and red cell transfusion (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.1-7.0). We observed a nonsignificant rise in the rate of PPH in women with VWD and haemophilia. Only 49.5% pregnancies with bleeding disorders had third trimester coagulation factor levels checked. Higher odds of PPH and antepartum haemorrhage were observed even with factor levels ≥0.50 IU/mL in third trimester. Despite comprehensive care in women with bleeding disorders, they are still at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to population controls."

We included severe HA patients under 1 year who started emicizumab prophylaxis since 2018, with longitudinal follow-up. The study collected data on demographics, clinical and laboratory variables, the occurrence of bleeding events, surgeries and treatment outcomes. Of the 27 enrolled infants, whose median age at prophylaxis initiation was 7 months, 24 primarily choose to start emicizumab therapy (3/27 switched from FVIII prophylaxis due to development of FVIII inhibitors). The median age for prophylaxis initiation decreased to 3 months in 2023. Following emicizumab initiation, the median calculated ABR decreased, and no intracranial haemorrhages were observed. Thrombin generation showed a significant improvement in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential at steady state after a loading period. Our study highlights a shift towards early prophylaxis in the era of non-replacement therapies. It underscores the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of treatment approaches, emphasizing personalized care and diligent monitoring in the evolving field of paediatric haemophilia care."

The phase 3 PUPs A-LONG study evaluated the safety and efficacy of efmoroctocog alfa (a recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein, herein referred to as rFVIIIFc) in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe hemophilia A. Male PUPs <6 years old were enrolled and received rFVIIIFc; inhibitor development was the primary end point. Post hoc analyses, including patient treatment regimen patterns and timing of inhibitor development, descriptive and Kaplan-Meier analyses of time to first inhibitor-positive test by treatment regimen and by titer, and consumption, were performed to describe patients who developed inhibitors during PUPs A-LONG. We investigated patient characteristics (eg, demographics and genotype) and nongenetic risk factors (eg, intense factor exposure and central venous access device [CVAD] placement) that may predict inhibitor development and characteristics of inhibitor development (low-titer vs high-titer inhibitor). Baseline characteristics were similarly distributed for age, race, and ethnicity across both patients who were inhibitor-positive and those who were inhibitor-negative (all P > .05). High-risk F8 variants were associated with development of high-titer inhibitors (P = .028). High-titer inhibitor development was often preceded by the presence of a low-titer inhibitor. Patients whose low-titer inhibitor progressed to a high-titer inhibitor received a higher mean dose per infusion (98.4 IU/kg, n = 5) compared with those whose low-titer inhibitor resolved spontaneously (59.2 IU/kg, n = 7; P = .033) or persisted (45.0 IU/kg, n = 5; P = .047). There was no association between CVAD placement surgery and inhibitor development. Post hoc analyses suggest that F8 genotype and dose of factor are as important as inhibitor risk factors and require further investigation.

However, cellular immune responses mediated by cytotoxic (CD8<sup>+</sup>) and helper (CD4<sup>+</sup>) T cells may target vector-transduced cells as well as healthy immune cells, impacting safety and efficacy. In this study, we describe the optimization and reproducibility of interferon-γ (IFNγ)-based and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays for measuring T cell responses against AAV peptide antigens. For method optimization, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy human donors and stimulated with commercially available major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II-specific peptides as positive controls. Peptide pools were designed from published AAV8 and AAV9 capsid protein sequences and then used to assess the presence of AAV-specific T cell responses. Our results demonstrate a measurable increase in IFNγ and IL-2-producing cells after AAV peptide presentation. Furthermore, there was an observed difference in the magnitude and specificity of response to peptide pools based on AAV serotype and donor. Finally, using individual peptides, we identified a region of the AAV9 capsid protein that can elicit an immunogenic response. This work shows the applicability of ELISpot in assessing anti-AAV immune responses and provides insight into how novel recombinant AAV vectors could be designed to reduce immunogenic potential."

    "title": "Hematological Complications in a COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is a hemorrhagic disorder caused by insufficient or inadequate coagulation factor VIII activity. Two different forms are described: congenital, hereditary X-linked, and acquired. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare condition and it is defined by the production of autoantibodies neutralizing factor VIII, known as inhibitors. We report the case of a 72-year-old man with a clinical diagnosis of AHA after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has been described in association with several hematological complications. SARS-CoV-2 infection could represent the immunological trigger for the development of autoantibodies. In our patient, SARS-CoV-2 infection preceded the hemorrhagic complications by 15 days. This lag time is in line with the other cases reported and compatible with the development of an intense immune response with autoantibody production. It is possible that since our patient was affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus, he was more prone to an immune system pathological response against self-antigens. A prompt, appropriate therapeutic intervention with activated recombinant factor VII administration and cyclophosphamide has led to rapid remission of clinical and laboratory findings."

    "title": "Gene Therapy for Genetic Syndromes: Understanding the Current State to Guide Future Care.",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy holds promise as a life-changing option for individuals with genetic variants that give rise to disease. FDA-approved gene therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, β-Thalassemia, hemophilia A/B, retinal dystrophy, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy have generated buzz around the ability to change the course of genetic syndromes. However, this excitement risks over-expansion into areas of genetic disease that may not fit the current state of gene therapy. While in situ (targeted to an area) and ex vivo (removal of cells, delivery, and administration of cells) approaches show promise, they have a limited target ability. Broader in vivo gene therapy trials have shown various continued challenges, including immune response, use of immune suppressants correlating to secondary infections, unknown outcomes of overexpression, and challenges in driving tissue-specific corrections. Viral delivery systems can be associated with adverse outcomes such as hepatotoxicity and lethality if uncontrolled. In some cases, these risks are far outweighed by the potentially lethal syndromes for which these systems are being developed. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the field of genetic diseases to perform cost-benefit analyses for gene therapy. In this work, we present the current state while setting forth tools and resources to guide informed directions to avoid foreseeable issues in gene therapy that could prevent the field from continued success."

    "abstract": "Flexion deformity of the knee is a common complication following recurrent haemarthrosis in persons with haemophilia (PWH) on episodic factor replacement therapy, restricting independent mobility. There is limited literature on the comprehensive management of this condition. This report provides the outcome of a staged multidisciplinary approach for the correction of knee flexion deformity (KFD) even in limited resource settings. The data of 49 consecutive PWH who were treated for KFD were analysed. The approach included graded physical therapy (PT), followed by serial casting and/or mobilisation under anaesthesia (MUA). MUA was done in carefully selected knees. Surgical correction was opted when non-surgical methods failed. Of the 49 patients (55 knees), with a median KFD of 40 degrees (range: 10-90), 26/55 (47%) were corrected by graded PT. With serial casting, 9/19 (47%) knees had their KFD corrected. MUA was done for 11 knees of which five achieved correction (45%). Surgical correction was required for only seven knees (12.7%). Following this approach, KFD improved from 40 degrees (range: 10-90) to 15 degrees (range: 0-40), with only minor loss of flexion from 105 (range: 60-155) to 90 degrees (range: 30-150). Out of 55 KFD, 46 (83.6%) KFD were corrected; non-surgical, 39 (70.9%) and surgery, seven (12.7%). The remaining patients (nine KFD; 16.4%) were able to achieve their functional goal despite not meeting the correction criteria. This study shows that in PWH, functionally significant KFD correction can be achieved in about 71%, through non-surgical methods, even without prophylactic factor replacement."

    "abstract": "Independent data collection is crucial in addressing the challenges associated with gene therapy for hemophilia, which is a promising treatment option but requires careful monitoring and management of short-term and potential long-term safety concerns. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis has identified a minimum efficacy and safety data set included in the World Federation of Hemophilia Gene Therapy Registry that should be collected on a national basis at specific time points for each patient who has been treated with the gene therapy products. This Gene Therapy Minimum Data Set (GT-MDS) was developed to facilitate data collection and to ensure capturing the most relevant data and most known and unknown safety and efficacy parameters recently cited by the European Medicine Agencies. The concept of assembling a minimum data set is not about creating a new data set but rather about identifying a subset of critical and essential topics that should always be included. The GT-MDS is structured into 3 sections and comprises an abridged list of 6 topics during routine gene therapy follow-up, keeping the number of data points low but allowing for rapid and independent data evaluation. The World Federation of Hemophilia Gene Therapy Registry data set, developed by the World Federation of Hemophilia, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, and other organizations, including industry partners in 2020, is comprehensive. The GT-MDS reports the minimum relevant information that should not be lost and is mandatory to be collected for all patients who undergo gene therapy. Therefore, the implementation of the gene therapy registry and the minimum data set empowers and enhances data collection at a global level."

It is important to define and characterize the presence of joint complications in mild hemophilia to develop strategies to mitigate disease burden. To characterize the prevalence, clinical characteristics of joint bleeds, and risk factors that may lead to hemarthrosis in people with mild hemophilia. Following Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted for patients with mild hemophilia seen at the Yale Hemophilia Treatment Center or Classical Hematology Program. The medical records of 70 patients were reviewed. Eighty one percent were male and 19 percent were female. Twenty individuals with mild hemophilia had a history of joint bleeding, 13 were traumatic bleeds, 7 were spontaneous. The age of first joint bleed ranged from 4 to 58 years old, with an average age of 20.8-years old. Ten patients developed joint bleeds between the ages of 10 and 20 years old. The most common locations of joint bleeding were the knee (n = 11) and ankle (n = 7). Eight of 70 patients had hepatitis C (HCV), 6 experienced joint bleeding. In this study, almost one third of patients with mild hemophilia experienced joint bleeding, often without history of trauma. Joint range of motion was abnormal in more than a third of the patients with mild hemophilia regardless. These data highlight the need for ongoing evaluation and characterization of joint health in individuals with mild hemophilia. Twenty-nine percent of individuals with mild hemophilia had history of joint bleed. PwH and mild diseases with previous or current hepatitis C had higher likelihood of joint bleeding. Approximately 15% of PwH and mild diseases had abnormal joint examinations without a confirmed history of joint bleeding."

This study aimed to assess the HRQoL of haemophilia children and related factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study from 6 April 2019 to 29 April 2019. We recruited children aged 8-16 years old who were members of the Yogyakarta Province Branch, Indonesian Haemophilia Society. Children filled in the Indonesian Haemo-QoL short-version questionnaire that consists of nine dimensions, and the score ranges from 0 to 100, in which a higher score shows a higher impartment. Forty-four children participated in this study. The mean age was 11.99 + 2.49. The median age of the first bleeding episode was 5 years, and the median frequency of spontaneous bleeding during the previous year was 13.5. All children received antihemophilic factor (AHF) on-demand; most (81.8%) received AHF in the advanced symptoms. The mean total score of HRQoL was 42.7 ± 15.5, with the highest impairment in the family dimension, with a mean score of 68.0 ± 22.3. The severity of haemophilia was significantly correlated with the total score of HRQoL and dimensions of physical health, feeling, view, and family (effect size ranges from 0.30 to 0.42). The frequency of bleeding was significantly related to the total score of HRQoL and the feeling dimension (effect size of 0.47 and 0.34). The HRQoL of our study was lower than in countries where AHF prophylactic is provided. More severe haemophilia and more frequent bleeding significantly lower HRQoL."

    "abstract": "For people with haemophilia A (PwHA), bleeding in the joints leads to joint damage and haemophilia-related arthropathy, impacting range of motion and life expectancy. Existing guidelines for managing haemophilia A support healthcare professionals (HCPs) and PwHA in their efforts to preserve joint health. However, such guidance should be reviewed, considering emerging evidence and consensus as presented in this manuscript. Fifteen HCPs experienced in the management of PwHA in the UK participated in a three-round Delphi panel. Consensus was defined at ≥70% of panellists agreeing or disagreeing for Likert-scale questions, and ≥70% selecting the same option for multiple- or single-choice questions. Questions not reaching consensus were revised for the next round. 26.8% (11/41), 44.8% (13/29) and 93.3% (14/15) of statements reached consensus in Rounds 1, 2 and 3, respectively. HCPs agreed that prophylaxis should be offered to patients with a baseline factor VIII (FVIII) level of ≤5 IU/dL and that, where there is no treatment burden, the aim of prophylaxis should be to achieve a trough FVIII level ≥15 IU/dL and maintain a longer period with FVIII levels of ≥20-30 IU/dL to provide better bleed protection. The aspirational goal for PwHA is to prevent all joint bleeds, which may be achieved by maintaining normalised (50-150 IU/dL) FVIII levels. The panel of experts were largely aligned on approaches to preserving joint health in PwHA, and this consensus may help guide HCPs."

We report the final results of an interventional, post-marketing study of damoctocog alfa pegol prophylaxis in patients with severe haemophilia A. In this open-label, interventional, post-marketing, phase 4 trial (NCT04085458), previously FVIII-treated patients with severe haemophilia A aged ≥18 years received damoctocog alfa pegol for ≥100 exposure days (EDs). Patients initially received 45 IU/kg every 5 days (recommended) or 40 IU/kg twice-weekly. At Visit 3, patients' doses could be increased, or treatment frequency adapted. The primary endpoint was FVIII inhibitor development (titre ≥.6 Bethesda units). Secondary endpoints included anti-polyethylene glycol (PEG) antibody development, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and annualized bleeding rate (ABR). Overall, 36 patients were enrolled; 32 patients received treatment, of whom, 27 completed the study. No patients developed FVIII inhibitors; three tested transiently positive for low-titre anti-PEG antibodies without clinical relevance. Three patients reported study-drug-related AEs of mild or moderate intensity. Two patients discontinued the study due to AEs. No deaths occurred. Most patients (70%) were treated with E5D/E7D regimens. The median (Q1;Q3) total ABR (N = 30) was 3.0 (.0;9.0) pre-study and 1.8 (.7;5.9) during the study. Damoctocog alfa pegol individualized prophylaxis regimens were well-tolerated with no immunogenicity concerns. ABRs improved following the switch from pre-study prophylaxis to damoctocog alfa pegol prophylaxis. These results support the favourable safety and efficacy profile of damoctocog alfa pegol prophylaxis."

    "abstract": "The management of hemophilia A has undergone a remarkable revolution, in line with technological advancement. In the recent past, the primary concern associated with Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates was the risk of infections, which is now almost resolved by advanced blood screening and viral inactivation methods. Improving patients' compliance with prophylaxis has become a key focus, as it can lead to improved health outcomes and reduced health care costs in the long term. Recent bioengineering research is directed toward prolonging the recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) coagulant activity and synthesising higher FVIII yields. As an outcome, B-domain deleted, polyethylene glycolated, single-chain, Fc-fused rFVIII, and rFVIIIFc-von Willebrand Factor-XTEN are available for patients. Moreover, emicizumab, a bispecific antibody, is commercially available, whereas fitusiran and tissue factor pathway inhibitor are in clinical trial stages as alternative strategies for patients with inhibitors. With these advancements, noninfectious complications, such as inhibitor development, allergic reactions, and thrombosis, are emerging concerns requiring careful management. In addition, the recent approval of gene therapy is a major milestone toward a permanent cure for hemophilia A. The vast array of treatment options at our disposal today empowers patients and providers alike, to tailor therapeutic regimens to the unique needs of each individual. Despite significant progress in modern treatment options, these highly effective therapies are markedly more expensive than conventional replacement therapy, limiting their access for patients in developing countries."

The phase IIIb multicenter, single-arm STASEY study evaluated safety and tolerability of emicizumab prophylaxis in PwHA aged ≥12 years with FVIII inhibitors. This analysis assesses surgeries during study conduct, associated hemophilia medications, and postoperative bleeds (treated and untreated). <b>Methods</b> PwHA with FVIII inhibitors received emicizumab 3.0 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks, then 1.5 mg/kg/week until 2 years. Surgeries were managed and documented by treating physicians. Bleeds and treatments were recorded by physicians and participants. <b>Results</b> Forty-six participants had ≥1 on-study surgery, 37 underwent 56 minor surgeries, and 13 underwent 22 major surgeries. Four participants underwent both minor and major surgeries. Of 18 (81.8%) and 4 (18.2%) major surgeries managed with/without additional hemostatic medication, 33.3 and 25.0% were associated with a treated postoperative bleed, respectively. Of 24 (42.9%) and 32 (57.1%) minor surgeries managed with/without additional hemostatic medication, 15.6 and 25.0% were associated with a treated postoperative bleed, respectively. Recombinant activated FVII was the most common medication for prophylaxis and bleed treatment. There were no thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). One hypertrophic clot, considered unrelated to emicizumab, occurred following tooth extraction. <b>Conclusion</b> In this challenging population with a high bleeding risk, major surgeries were performed in PwHA receiving emicizumab with/without additional hemostatic medication. Postoperative bleeds occurred following 59.1% of major surgeries; 53.8% were treated. No arterial/venous thrombotic events or TMAs occurred due to concomitant emicizumab and bypassing agents. <b>Trial registration</b> This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03191799)."

The treatment landscape has substantially changed by introducing novel extended half-life factor VIII (EHL-FVIII) replacement therapies such as efanesoctocog Alfa and non-factor replacement therapy such as emicizumab. These agents signal a shift from treatments requiring multiple weekly infusions to advanced therapies with long half-lives, offering superior protection against bleeding and improving patient adherence and quality of life. While EHL-FVIII treatment might lead to inhibitor development in some patients, non-factor replacement therapy carries thrombotic risks.

To analyze best available evidences of VTE rates in persons with hemophilia A or B undergoing lower limb TJR and the use of postoperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. We systematically screened 4 online biomedical databases to identify studies reporting VTE rates in patients with hemophilia after TJR. Case reports and case series with less than 10 patients were excluded. Twenty-six observational studies were included in this systematic review, reporting 1181 TJRs in patients with hemophilia A or B. Eight studies had VTE rates as the primary outcome. Five studies reported screen-detected VTE, while 21 reported symptomatic VTE events. Overall, 17 VTE events were reported (1.4%; 95% CI, 0.9%-2.3%), including 10 (6.6%) after 151 surgeries with postoperative VTE screening and 7 (0.7%) after 1080 surgeries without postoperative screening. Thromboprophylaxis protocols were specified in 21 studies; postoperative thromboprophylaxis was used in 15 (1.3%) surgeries. This information was not available for 29.0% of the analyzed population. Despite the low thromboprophylaxis use in patients with hemophilia, rates of symptomatic VTE after TJR appeared to be low. We also highlighted the need to better report the thrombotic outcome in persons with hemophilia to face the ongoing changes in the hemophilia landscape."

To assess bleeding before and during immune tolerance induction (ITI) and its association with ITI regimen and inhibitor titer, we selected and analyzed data on patients receiving high-titer inhibitors from the international prospective PedNet cohort study. In total, 222 patients with severe hemophilia A and inhibitor titers of >5 Bethesda units (BU) were followed from the first positive to the first negative inhibitor result (median overall follow-up, 1.7 years). Mean annual (joint) bleeding rates (AJBR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were compared according to treatment and inhibitor titer using multivariable negative binomial regression. Before ITI, 115 patients showed an ABR of 6.1 (5.0-7.4) and an AJBR 2.6 (2.1-3.2). Bleeding was independent of inhibitor titer. During ITI, 202 patients had an ABR of 4.4 (3.9-5.1) and an AJBR of 1.7 (1.5-2.0). AJBR during ITI increased with inhibitor titer (hazard ratio [HR] for ≥200 BU vs 5 to 39 BU [4.9; CI, 3.2-7.4]) and decreased with daily ITI infusions (HR, 0.4; CI, 0.3-0.6) or activated prothrombin complex concentrate prophylaxis (HR, 0.4; CI, 0.2-0.8), whereas ITI dose and recombinant activated factor VII prophylaxis did not independently affect bleeding. These data provide evidence for a protective effect of repeated FVIII infusions (ITI) on bleeding in patients who have developed inhibitors; these data should be used to plan ITI and/or serve as a comparator for prophylaxis with nonreplacement therapy."

This study aimed to examine the risk of low BMD and changes in BMD in PWH. A comprehensive systematic search was performed in 4 databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The last search was carried out on 11 December 2022. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 16 were used for meta-analysis. Odds ratios were calculated by the incidence of low BMD between the haemophilia and control groups in each study. A meta-analysis of the odds ratios for each study was performed to estimate pooled odds ratios. Fixed effects models or random effects models were used to assess outcomes. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Higgins' I<sup>2</sup>. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to interpret the potential source of heterogeneity. A funnel plot, Egger's regression test, and the trim-and-fill method were used to assess publication bias. 19 of 793 studies, published between 2004 and 2022, that were identified by search strategy were included in this meta-analysis. The risk for low BMD was approximately four times higher compared to controls. PWH have significantly lower lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip BMD. Subgroup analysis showed that the risk of low BMD did not increase significantly in developed countries. Very low heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analysis of the risk of low BMD. The result from Egger's regression test suggested that there may be publication bias. However, the meta-analysis results did not alter after the trim-and-fill correction and the findings were robust. Haemophilia was associated with an increased risk of low BMD. However, the risk of low BMD did not increase significantly in developed countries. And BMD was reduced in PWH, regardless of age, region, or economic ability. For PWH, our concerns should extend beyond bleeding and osteoarthritis to encompass BMD starting at a young age."

We sought to understand how people with haemophilia (PwH) and their caregivers value the potential benefits of novel prophylactic treatments. We conducted a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to quantify preferences for features of haemophilia treatments among adults and caregivers of children with haemophilia. A best-worst scaling (BWS) exercise measured the perceived burden of treatment administration features. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was administered to male adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of male children (≤17 years) living with haemophilia in the United States. Respondents evaluated eight pairs of hypothetical haemophilia treatment profiles defined by six attributes in the DCE and 15 features in the BWS. In the DCE, both adults with haemophilia (n = 151) and caregivers (n = 151) prioritised avoiding the risk of developing inhibitor/ anti-drug antibodies and treatments that allowed for a more active life. They placed a lower priority on reducing the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes, route and frequency of administration, and avoiding the risk of hospitalisation due to adverse events. The BWS documented the burdensomeness of IV infusions and medications that require mixing and refrigeration. PwH and caregivers prefer treatments that enable a more active lifestyle with a lower risk of inhibitor development. Both groups valued the ability to lead an active life over reducing spontaneous bleeding, with caregivers placing the most weight on this attribute. As new treatments expand possibilities, healthcare professionals and PwH should continue to share decision-making, incorporating clinical judgment and individual preferences."

Few studies have described hemophilia variants in the Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic profiles of 193 hemophilia patients from southern China. Utilizing Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, gap detection, long-range PCR, and multiplex PCR, we identified both <i>F8</i> and <i>F9</i> gene variants. Pregnant women with a history of hemophilia A offspring underwent amniocentesis or villus sampling for the variant detection. Variants in <i>F8</i> and <i>F9</i> were pinpointed in 183 patients, with 26 being novel discoveries. Notably, genetic testing was absent in the initial evaluation of 133 out of 161 patients, leading to a protracted average definitive diagnosis timeline of 2 years. Remarkably, two hemophilia A cases with anticipated severe phenotypes due to protein-truncating variants presented with only moderate or mild clinical manifestations. Among the 40 fetuses tested, 34 were males, with 17 exhibiting hemizygous variants in the <i>F8</i> gene. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of <i>F8</i> and <i>F9</i> variant spectrum and highlight the underuse of genetic analyses in southern China."

To evaluate the long-term impact of damoctocog alfa pegol in a post hoc subgroup analysis of adolescent patients in the PROTECT VIII Kids study and its extension from 12th birthday onwards. The current analysis included PTPs aged ≥12 years old, who remained in the extension for ≥6 months following their 12th birthday. The observation period was defined as the time from 12th birthday to the end of the extension period; all data from this birthday were included whether in the main study or extension phase. The main efficacy variable was annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and the main safety variable was the frequency of inhibitor development. This subgroup analysis comprised 25 patients. Median observation time after 12th birthday was 3.2 years. Median total/joint/spontaneous ABRs in the observation period were 1.7/0.7/0.3, respectively. Safety findings were consistent with those reported for the overall study population; no confirmed FVIII inhibitors or anti-drug antibodies were reported. Damoctocog alfa pegol is efficacious with a favourable safety profile in adolescents with haemophilia A, supporting its long-term use in children and adolescents."

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A (HA) is predominantly associated with males due to X-linked inheritance. Males and females with HA have shared unmet medical needs, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive care irrespective of sex. This analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of emicizumab prophylaxis in 3 females with HA. HAVEN 6 (NCT04158648) is a phase III study of emicizumab in people with non-severe HA without factor (F)VIII inhibitors warranting prophylaxis per investigator assessment, and the study methodology has been reported previously. Female-specific endpoints included menstruation-related quality of life and menstruation heaviness. HAVEN 6 enrolled 3 females aged ≥18 years and within reproductive age (<i>n</i> = 2 mild HA; <i>n</i> = 1 moderate HA; <i>n</i> = 2 receiving prior FVIII prophylaxis; <i>n</i> = 1 receiving prior episodic FVIII). Participants presented with diverse bleeding phenotypes at baseline: 2 had no bleeds in the 24 weeks prior to enrollment, while 1 had an annualized bleed rate for all bleeds of 208.6. On-study annualized bleed rates for all bleeds were 0, 2.8, and 11.6, respectively. The 2 evaluable participants indicated improved menstruation-related quality of life vs baseline. Two participants experienced 3 grade 1/2 treatment-related adverse events; no new safety signals were identified. All 3 participants preferred emicizumab over their previous treatment and reported a better score for treatment burden and preoccupation domains of the Comprehensive Assessment Tool of Challenges in Hemophilia questionnaire. Overall, results were consistent with those reported in the male population enrolled in the HAVEN 6 study, suggesting efficacy and a favorable safety profile for emicizumab in females with non-severe HA warranting prophylaxis."

    "abstract": "Emicizumab is a bispecific humanized monoclonal antibody that shortens the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), making aPTT-based tests unreliable. To evaluate the efficacy of a mixture of 2 anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies (anti-emi) in neutralizing emicizumab in samples from persons with hemophilia A treated with emicizumab. Fifty samples from persons with hemophilia A treated with emicizumab were analyzed for aPTT and factor VIII procoagulant activity; FVIII inhibitor titer was measured using Nijmegen-Bethesda assay in 50 plasma samples of additional patients (positive for FVIII inhibitor) treated with emicizumab. FVIII procoagulant activity and inhibitor titer were measured using 1-stage (Actin FS, Siemens) and chromogenic assays with bovine regents (Factor VIII Chromogenic Assay, Siemens). Emicizumab concentration was measured by modified a 1-stage assay calibrated with a drug-specific calibrator (r<sup>2</sup> Diagnostics Inc). All the tests were performed on Sysmex CS-2400 (Sysmex) before and after the addition of anti-emi (Chugai Pharmaceutical). Emicizumab concentrations measured after neutralization were <1.6 μg/mL in all samples. FVIII levels were >480 IU/dL with an aPTT of <30.8 seconds in all samples before neutralization and were <1 IU/dL with an aPTT of >70 seconds after adding anti-emi. FVIII inhibitor resulted in a false negative result in 44 of 50 samples measured with the 1-stage assay before neutralization. A good correlation (r = 0.98) was found between inhibitor titer measured using the chromogenic (insensitive to emicizumab) and 1-stage assays after neutralization. The anti-emi antibodies were shown to completely neutralize emicizumab, making samples pretreated with anti-emi analyzable with the 1-stage assay."

    "abstract": "In racially diverse communities, treatment of chronic diseases can vary across racial and ethnic groups. To examine healthcare disparities in hemophilia care in the United States by evaluating receipt of immune tolerance induction (ITI) among different racial and ethnic groups. In this cross-sectional study, people with severe hemophilia A with an inhibitor who entered the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Community Counts registry between 2013 and 2017, were aged ≥5 years at study entry, and had a history of an inhibitor (<i>n</i> = 614) were included. The proportion of participants receiving ITI was examined according to race and ethnicity in bivariable analysis and multivariable analysis adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios and corresponding 95% CIs were computed. Among 614 participants included in the study, 56.4% were non-Hispanic (NH) White, 19.7% were NH Black, 18.4% were Hispanic, and 4.9% were Asian. ITI was received by 85.2% of participants. On bivariable analysis, ITI treatment did not vary by race or ethnicity. On multivariable analysis, NH Black and Hispanic participants were significantly less likely to receive ITI compared to NH White participants (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.84-0.99] and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75-0.93], respectively). Although the role of ITI may evolve with growing use of emicizumab and the introduction of new hemophilia treatment products, understanding characteristics that influence care, particularly race and ethnicity, where physician bias and patient mistrust can occur, will remain relevant and applicable to other complex therapies, including gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Persons with hemophilia may encounter various traumatic experiences related to their bleeding disorder throughout their lifetime. Little is known about the clinical impact of disease-related trauma on this population. To explore the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and posttraumatic stress symptoms in adults with hemophilia A and B and characterize the traumatic experiences they report. An online survey tool collecting data on participant characteristics and a validated questionnaire containing the PTSD checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 were distributed via Research Electronic Data Capture to adults with hemophilia A and B during their annual visit to their hemophilia treatment center. Participants were asked about traumatic experiences specific to their hemophilia prior to self-administering the PTSD checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 questionnaire. Survey responses from 178 individuals across 3 hemophilia treatment centers were included in the analysis, representing a 70% response rate. One hundred one (56.7%) participants identified a hemophilia-related traumatic event, and 21 (11.8%) participants met criteria for a provisional diagnosis of PTSD. Multivariable analysis showed higher odds of a positive PTSD screen in participants with noninfectious (odds ratio [OR], 13.89; 95% CI, 2.23-86.62) and infectious comorbidities (OR, 11.18; 95% CI, 1.34-93.45) and in participants with >1 mental health comorbidity (OR, 10.07; 95% CI, 2.39-42.52). On the contrary, age >46 years (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.01-0.62) and higher education (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07-0.88) reduced odds of PTSD. Persons with hemophilia are at risk of developing PTSD and posttraumatic stress symptoms. These data support the need for trauma screening, psychosocial services in the bleeding disorders community, and provision of trauma-informed care by providers."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of hemophilia varies globally, with close to 100% of patients diagnosed in high-income countries and as low as 12% diagnosed in lower-income countries. These inequalities in the care of people with hemophilia exist across various care indicators. This analysis aims to describe the clinical care outcomes of patients in the World Bleeding Disorders Registry (WBDR). In 2018, the World Federation of Hemophilia developed a global registry, the WBDR, to permit hemophilia treatment centers to collect clinical data, monitor patient care longitudinally, and identify gaps in management and treatment. As of July 18, 2022, 10,276 people with hemophilia were enrolled from 87 hemophilia treatment centers in 40 countries. Nearly half (49%, <i>n</i> = 5084) of patients had severe hemophilia; 99% were male, 85% had hemophilia A, and 67% were from low-middle-income countries. Globally, the age of diagnosis for people with severe hemophilia has improved considerably over the last 50 years, from 82 months (∼7 years) for those born before 1980 to 11 months for those born after 2010, and most prominently, among people with severe hemophilia in low- and low-middle-income countries, the age of diagnosis improved from 418 months (∼35 years) for those born before 1970 to 12 months for those born after 2010. Overall, the age of diagnosis of people with hemophilia in low- and low-middle-income countries is delayed by 3 decades compared to patients in upper-middle-income countries and by 4 decades compared to patients in high-income countries. Data reveal large treatment and care disparities between socioeconomic groups, showing improvements when prophylaxis is initiated to prevent bleeding. Overall, care provided in low-income countries lags behind high-income countries by up to 40 years. Limitations in the interpretation of data include risk of survival and selection bias."

    "abstract": "Clotting factor concentrates have been the mainstay of severe hemophilia treatment over the last 50 years. Differences in risk of neutralizing antibody (inhibitor) formation according to concentrate used remain clinically relevant. To assess inhibitor development according to type of clotting factor concentrate in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe hemophilia A and B. The European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS) and Canadian Bleeding Disorders Registry (CBDR) have been monitoring adverse events overall and according to concentrate for 11 and 8 years, respectively. Inhibitors were reported quarterly, and PUPs completed 50 exposure days without inhibitor development annually. Cumulative inhibitor incidences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were compared without adjustment for other risk factors. Fifty-six European and 23 Canadian centers reported inhibitor development in 312 of 1219 (26%; CI, 23%-28%) PUPs with severe hemophilia A and 14 of 173 (8%; CI, 5%-13%) PUPs with severe hemophilia B. Inhibitor development was lower on plasma-derived factor (F)VIII (pdFVIII, 20%; CI, 14%-26%) than on standard half-life recombinant FVIII (SHL-rFVIII, 27%; CI, 24%-30% and odds ratio, 0.67; CI, 0.45%-0.98%; <i>P</i> = .04). Extended half-life recombinant FVIII (EHL-rFVIII, 22%; CI, 12%-36%) showed an intermediate inhibitor rate, while inhibitor rates for Advate (26%; CI, 22%-31%) and Kogenate/Helixate (30%; CI, 24%-36%) overlapped. For other SHL-rFVIII concentrates, inhibitor rates varied from 3% to 43%. Inhibitor development was similar for pdFIX (11%; CI, 3%-25%), SHL-rFIX (8%; CI, 3%-15%), and EHL-rFIX (7%; CI, 1%-22%). While confirming expected rates of inhibitors in PUPs, inhibitor development was lower in pdFVIII than in SHL-rFVIII. Preliminary data suggest variation in inhibitor development among different SHL-rFVIII and EHL-rFVIII concentrates."

We describe a case of an adult male with severe hemophilia A, who presented for primary hip replacement due to severe hemophilic arthropathy and was managed with ultrasound-facilitated neuraxial anesthesia. Due to bleeding risks, additional considerations were necessary to minimize development of postoperative spinal hematoma. There were no perioperative adverse events. Careful preoperative multidisciplinary planning, perioperative management of neuraxial anesthesia (including the use of spinal ultrasound), and hemostasis were instrumental to successfully accomplish this. Following these principles, we demonstrate that neuraxial techniques may be a safe option for managing patients with severe hemophilia A."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy have made remarkable progress in recent years. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to assess the efficacy and safety of AAV-based gene therapy for hemophilia. We systematically searched the Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases, for clinical trials involving patients diagnosed with hemophilia and treated with AAV-mediated gene therapy. Data on the annualized bleeding rate (ABR), annualized infusion rate (AIR), the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), severe adverse events (SAEs), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation were extracted as our outcomes. A total of 12 articles from 11 clinical trials were selected from 868 articles for meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed that AAV-based gene therapy in hemophilia patients reduced the number of bleeding events and the number of factor infusion events by an approximate average of 7 per year and 103 per year, respectively. Eighty percent, 18%, and 63% of hemophilia patients had elevated TRAE, SAE, and ALT levels, respectively. Moreover, subgroup analysis found a significant reduction in ABR and AIR 2-3 years after the therapy. Additional findings that were not pooled including coagulation factor activity are presented in the accompanying tables. Our analysis supported the efficacy and safety of AAV-mediated gene therapy for hemophilia, providing evidence for its application as a therapeutic option for widespread clinical use in hemophilia patients in the future."

    "abstract": "Patients with hemophilia (PWH) constantly suffer hemarthrosis, which leads to deformity of the hip joint. Therefore, PWH who are going to receive total hip arthroplasty (THA) should be exclusively treated before the surgery with careful measurement of their proximal femur. Hence, we conducted a retrospective study to explore the anatomical parameters of and differences in the proximal femur in hemophilic patients who underwent THA. The retrospective study comprised data of adult patients who received total hip arthroplasty from 2020 to 2022 in the research center. Patients having a diagnosis of hemophilic arthritis and received THA were included in experimental group, and patients with hip arthritis or femoral head necrosis were taken as control group. Parameters including femoral offset, neck-shaft angle (NSA), medullary cavity of 20 mm above mid-lesser trochanter level (T+20), mid-lesser trochanter level (T), and 20 mm blow it (T-20), and canal flare index (CFI), femoral cortical index (FCI) were measured on X-ray and CT images with PACS by two independent doctors. Data was analyzed by SPSS 20. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test data normality. Student's t-test was performed between PWH and control group. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Among the 94 hips, 39 (41.5%) were included in group hemophilia and 55(58.5%) in control group. The mean age of the patients was 49.36 ± 12.92 years. All cases were male patients. Data demonstrated significantly smaller femoral cortical index (FCI), femoral offset, medullary cavity of 20 mm above mid-lesser trochanter level, mid-lesser trochanter level, and 20 mm below it, and neck-shaft angle (NSA) was obviously larger in PWH than control group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in canal flare index (CFI). Hemophilic patients undergoing THA were prone to longer and thinner proximal femur. Preoperative morphological analysis of femur is recommended."

    "abstract": "Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disorder marked by autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII, leading to bleeding complications. This case report explores a unique presentation of AHA, initially manifested as gross hematuria, a symptom often encountered in healthcare settings with a broad range of differential diagnoses. The background of this study highlights the rarity of AHA and its diverse clinical presentations. The case involves a 62-year-old man with no history of bleeding disorders, presenting with gross hematuria and later developing severe anemia and ecchymoses. Methods employed in the evaluation included urological assessments such as cystoscopy and computed tomography, alongside hematological investigations, which later revealed a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and a critically low factor VIII level, indicative of AHA. Results showed a lack of early recognition of coagulation abnormalities, underscoring the need for comprehensive initial assessments in cases of unexplained hematuria. The patient's management at a specialized Hemophilia Center involved inhibitor eradication therapy and management of acute bleeding episodes, resulting in significant clinical improvement. The conclusions drawn from this case emphasize the importance of considering rare conditions like AHA in the differential diagnosis of hematuria and the necessity for a broad diagnostic approach. It advocates for heightened awareness and early coagulation studies in unexplained cases of hematuria to prevent delayed diagnoses and improve patient outcomes. This case contributes to the understanding of AHA's clinical variability and the critical nature of early and comprehensive diagnostic approaches in hematuria evaluation."
