    "title": "The Hidden Burden: Gastrointestinal Involvement in Lysosomal Storage Disorders.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases characterized by defects in lysosomal enzyme function or membrane transport. These defects lead to substrate accumulation and multisystemic manifestations. This review focuses on gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in LSDs, which is a significant but often overlooked aspect of these disorders. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of GI manifestations in several LSDs, including Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Niemann-Pick disease type C, mucopolysaccharidoses and Wolman disease. The pathogenesis of GI involvement in LSDs varies and encompasses substrate accumulation in enterocytes, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, mass effects, smooth muscle dysfunction, vasculopathy, neuropathy, inflammation and alterations to the microbiota. Clinical presentations range from non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and malabsorption, to more severe complications, such as protein-losing enteropathy and inflammatory bowel disease. Diagnosis often requires a high level of suspicion, as GI symptoms may precede the diagnosis of the underlying LSD or be misattributed to more common conditions. Management strategies include disease-specific treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, as well as supportive care and targeted interventions for specific GI complications. This review highlights the importance of recognizing and properly managing GI manifestations in LSDs to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. It also emphasizes the need for further research to develop more effective treatments for life-threatening GI complications associated with these rare genetic disorders."

    "title": "Analysis of the Effect of Demographic Variables on Lysosomal Enzyme Activities in the Missouri Newborn Screening Program.",
    "abstract": "Newborn screening laboratories are increasingly adding lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) and Pompe disease, to their screening panels. Without newborn screening, LSDs are frequently diagnosed only after the onset of symptoms; late detection can lead to profound and irreversible organ damage and mortality. While screening of these disorders has accelerated over the past five years, there is little published information regarding the potential correlation of demographic variables (age at sample collection, birthweight, gestational age, gender, etc.) with lysosomal enzyme activity. The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory prospectively screened more than 475,000 newborns for MPS I, Pompe disease, Gaucher disease, and Fabry disease between 15 January 2013 and 15 May 2018. This report investigates trends between several demographic variables and activities of four lysosomal enzymes: α-L-iduronidase (IDUA), acid α-glucosidase (GAA), acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and acid α-galactosidase (GLA). This information provides a valuable resource to newborn screening laboratories for the implementation of screening for lysosomal storage disorders and the establishment of screening cutoffs."

    "title": "Early Atrial Remodeling Drives Arrhythmia in Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-Gal A (α-galactosidase A) deficiency, resulting in multiorgan accumulation of sphingolipid, namely globotriaosylceramide. This triggers ventricular myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation, driving arrhythmia and sudden death. Atrial fibrillation is common, yet the cellular mechanisms accounting for this are unknown. To address this, we conducted ECG analysis from a large cohort of 115 adults with FD at varying cardiomyopathy stages. ECG P-wave characteristics were compared with non-FD controls. Cellular contractile and electrophysiological function were examined in a novel atrial cellular FD model developed and imputed into in silico atrial models to provide insight into mechanisms of arrhythmia. Induced pluripotent stem cells were genome-edited using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 to introduce the <i>GLA</i> p.<i>N215S</i> variant and differentiated into induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Contraction, calcium handling, and electrophysiology experiments were conducted. Bi-atrial in silico models were developed with cellular changes as in <i>GLA</i> p.<i>N215S</i> iPSC-CMs. ECG analysis demonstrated P-wave duration and PQ interval shortening in FD adults before the onset of cardiomyopathy. Patients with FD exhibited a higher incidence of premature atrial contractions and increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared with healthy controls. <i>GLA</i> p.<i>N215S</i> iPSC-CMs were deficient in α-Gal A and exhibited globotriaosylceramide accumulation. Atrial <i>GLA</i> p.<i>N215S</i> iPSC-CMs demonstrated a more positive diastolic membrane potential, faster action potential upstroke velocity, greater incidence of delayed afterdepolarizations, greater contraction force, and alterations in calcium handling compared with wild-type iPSC-CMs. Simulations with these changes in the in silico models resulted in similar P-wave morphology changes to those seen in early FD cardiomyopathy and increased atrial fibrillation vulnerability. These findings provide novel insights into underpinning mechanisms for atrial arrhythmia and a rationale for early P-wave changes in FD. These may be targeted to develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the arrhythmic burden in FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by impaired glycosphingolipid metabolism as a result of deficient or absent α-galactosidase A activity.This enzymatic defect leads to the progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids within various tissues, resulting in multisystem involvement, including renal dysfunction, cardiovascular pathology, cerebrovascular complications, andperipheral neuropathy.This report presents the case of a 57-year-old female who underwent kidney transplant 5 years earlier because of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology. Genetic screening identified the GLA gene variant c.937G>T (D313Y). The patient exhibited symptoms, including vertigo,tinnitus,headaches, andupperlimbparesthesia, alongside findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and microangiopathic white matter lesions. Initiation of migalastat therapy led to symptomatic improvement without adverse effects orthe need for modifications in her immunosuppressive regimen. After 33 months of migalastat therapy, renal function remained stable, left ventricular hypertrophy resolved, and no progression of cerebral white matter lesions was observed. Thus, migalastat was shown as a well-tolerated and effective therapeutic option for Fabry disease in kidney transplant recipients with amenable GLA mutations."

    "abstract": "A 59-year-old man presented with recurrent syncope and was found to have bifascicular block and severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. A permanent double-chamber pacemaker was implanted. Initial investigations revealed elevated transferrin saturation and homozygosity for the HFE gene p.C282Y variant, indicating hereditary hemochromatosis. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed inferolateral intramyocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) without evidence of iron deposition, raising suspicion for Fabry disease (FD). This was confirmed by low α-galactosidase A activity and detection of the pathogenic GLA p.F113L variant. Multisystemic evaluation revealed additional FD manifestations, and enzyme replacement therapy was initiated, later switched to oral migalastat. The patient subsequently developed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and apical thrombus, attributed to high ventricular pacing burden, and was scheduled for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation. Before the upgrade, he suffered a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, associated with coronary artery stenosis, requiring CRT-D implantation. Despite device therapy and amiodarone initiation, recurrent ventricular tachycardias (VTs) persisted, leading to percutaneous coronary intervention and electrical stability. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of overlapping cardiac diseases, the significance of inferolateral LGE and conduction abnormalities in suspecting FD, and the crucial role of family screening. The p.F113L variant is associated with late-onset, cardiac-predominant FD, where bradyarrhythmias are more prognostically relevant, but concurrent pathologies like coronary artery disease must be considered in VT presentations."

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop and validate a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method for quantifying eight nitrosamine (NA) impurities NDMA, NMBA, NDEA, NEIPA, NDIPA, NMPA, NDPA, and NDBA in a small molecule commercial Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and Drug Product (DP) capsules used for the treatment of Fabry rare disease in global patients. The method utilized gradient separation on a C18 column, ensuring optimum resolution between NAs and internal standards. Elution was monitored at precursor and product ions. The method was validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines, assessing specificity, linearity, recovery, and repeatability in both API and capsule matrices. Quantification of NAs ranged from 0.0215 to 0.780 ppm in relation to a 20.5 mg/mL sample concentration. Linearity coefficients ranged from 0.99 to 1.00. The Detection Limit (DL) was 0.154-0.560 ng/mL, and the Quantitation Limit (QL) was 0.438-1.590 ng/mL. Mean recoveries for all NAs were between 90 and 107%, and repeatability was under 15%. An Analytical Target Profile (ATP) concept was successfully employed to monitor Analytical Method Performance Characteristics (AMPC). The validated LC-MS/MS method proved effective for quantifying NAs (NDMA, NMBA, NDEA, NEIPA, NDIPA, NMPA, NDPA, and NDBA) in both API and capsule matrices, with results consistently below the Quantitation Limit (QL) in confirmatory testing. This approach supports the elimination of routine NA testing, adhering to FDA and EMA's conservative Acceptable Intake (AI) limits, ensuring safety and regulatory compliance for global patients."

    "title": "Maturation of lysosomal α-galactosidase A and implications for Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an inherited metabolic disease that is caused by an abnormal accumulation of sphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in lysosomes. Patients with Fabry disease have insufficient levels or no total activity of an enzyme called α-galactosidase A, which catalyzes the removal of terminal α-galactose saccharides from substrates such as Gb3. Because of the monogenetic nature of Fabry disease, the levels of enzyme activity correlate with disease outcome in patients, and thus enable genotype-phenotype predictions in the disease. Although Fabry disease results from reduced α-galactosidase A activity in the lysosome, there are many different molecular mechanisms for the loss of α-galactosidase A activity in Fabry disease patients, so it is of utmost importance to understand the journey and maturation of α-galactosidase A inside the cell. The proper synthesis of α-galactosidase A requires many steps, including the folding of the polypeptide, post-translational modifications, trafficking of the enzyme to the lysosome, and substrate binding. Furthermore, researchers and clinicians benefit from extensive clinical data, with over 1000 different mutations identified in patients, many of which are investigated by researchers. Finally, the availability of a pharmacological chaperone, which enhances the enzymatic activity of many α-galactosidase A variants, allows us to understand the biology better. This review will focus on the molecular steps that must be precisely orchestrated to properly synthesize the α-galactosidase A enzyme, and how failures in different maturation steps of α-galactosidase A lead to Fabry disease. We also describe how different treatment options address the loss of α-galactosidase A activity in the lysosome of patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, progressive disorder caused by pathogenic variants of the GLA gene resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Pain is a hallmark of FD, and patients often present with heterogeneous pain profiles. This cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted to characterize pain and pain crises in patients with FD in the United States and explore the effects of sex, disease phenotypes, and treatment on pain. A total of 66 participants (mean ± standard deviation [SD] age: 44.0 ± 12.7 years; females: 59.1%) completed the survey. Participants reported experiencing pain in upper (34.8%) and lower (43.9%) extremities several times a day and abdominal pain (31.8%) a few times a week. Overall, participants reported the nature of their pain as triggered (upper extremities: 47.0%; abdomen: 51.5%) or sudden (lower extremities: 57.6%). Female participants reported experiencing pain in upper (46.2%) and lower (48.7%) extremities several times a day and described it as sudden or triggered (48.7%) in upper extremities and sudden (61.5%) in lower extremities. Pain crises were reported in the lower extremities (80.0%), followed by the upper extremities (66.7%) and the abdomen (51.1%), and were often characterized as burning, tingling, or stabbing. A higher proportion of female participants (84.6%) than that of male participants (73.7%) reported pain crises in lower extremities. The duration of pain crises varied from 30 min to several days for different subgroups depending on sex and FD phenotypes. Most participants (81.0%) reported symptom improvement after 12 months of FD-specific treatment. Participants reported improvement in neuropathic symptoms (burning in hands, 45.9%), with an overall mean (± SD) satisfaction score of 7.2 (± 1.7) with agalsidase beta as the most recent medication. Pain was largely reported to be triggered across all subgroups. Consistent pain profiles were noted in participants across sex and FD phenotypes. Female participants reported pain burden similar to that of male participants, and pain crisis experience was heterogeneous across the subgroups. Most participants reported improvement in symptoms after FD-specific treatment and a high treatment satisfaction score with agalsidase beta."

Over 60% of patients experience heart-related issues, primarily arrhythmias. Unlike typical cases, these arrhythmias are complex and often do not respond well to standard antiarrhythmic drugs, sometimes worsening symptoms. This paper presents a case study of a FD patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation successfully treated using bilateral pulmonary vein cryoablation, resulting in positive outcomes. Additionally, we conducted molecular docking studies for the first time to assess the enzyme-substrate binding of E358del, confirming findings similar to laboratory experiments. Our findings underscore the potential role of artificial intelligence in better understanding FD, and aim to provide insights into managing arrhythmias associated with FD."

    "abstract": "The challenges encountered by women living with Fabry disease in Japan are not well understood. This study aimed to elucidate the experiences of women with Fabry disease and their support networks from both female and male perspectives. A 22-question survey was conducted among patients with Fabry disease and their caregivers (≥18 years) in Japan between August and October 2023. Sixty-two recipients completed the questionnaire (11.5 % response rate); 47 (75.8 %) were female and the mean age was 52.4 years. Overall, 51 respondents (82.3 %) identified as patients, 2 (3.2 %) as caregivers, 6 (9.7 %) as both a patient and caregiver, and 3 (4.8 %) as \"other\". In total, 43 respondents (69.4 %) were women with Fabry disease. Among life events surveyed, Fabry disease had the greatest impact for women during family planning. The most commonly reported concerns for women were inheritance of Fabry disease and impact on children, the main reasons for which were prejudice, stigma, and sense of guilt associated with inheritance. In all, 28.1 % of respondents felt family and colleagues understood women's challenges with Fabry disease, while 37.9 % believed their primary care physicians and 48.3 % felt their specialist physicians understood these challenges; 26.3 % thought women received tailored care, and 75.9 % felt the condition affects mental health. Women with Fabry disease in Japan face substantial emotional burdens and lack support from their community and physicians. Healthcare professionals can play a pivotal role by offering genetic counseling and developing support programs to alleviate mental burdens and provide education about the disease and family planning implications."

The therapy was tested on <i>GLA</i>-knockout human-induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived endothelial cells (<i>GLA</i>-KO-hiPSC-ECs) and podocytes (<i>GLA</i>-KO-hiPSC-PCs). <i>GLA</i>-KO-hiPSCs-ECs or -PCs, upon differentiation, were treated with <i>A4GALT</i>-siRNA-HLNP. Successful intracellular uptake of <i>A4GALT</i>-siRNA-HLNP was confirmed through fluorescence and electron microscopy in both cell types. <i>A4GALT</i>-siRNA-HLNP treatment confirmed both cell types' stability at 5 μg/mL. Increased Gb3 deposition and zebra body formation were detected in both cell types, but <i>A4GALT</i>-siRNA-HLNP treatment attenuated these FD phenotypes, demonstrating reduced expression of <i>A4GALT</i> through western blot analysis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the expression of transcripts associated with FD was restored by <i>A4GALT</i>-siRNA-HLNP treatment in <i>GLA</i>-KO-hiPSCs-ECs, whereas in <i>GLA</i>-KO-hiPSCs-PCs, this effect was relatively less pronounced. Suppression of <i>A4GALT</i> via siRNA/HLNP treatment significantly rescued FD phenotypes especially in EC, presenting a novel therapeutic approach for FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked genetic disorder characterized by alpha-galactosidase deficiency, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide. This accumulation causes multi-organ dysfunction, with renal involvement being particularly significant. Recently, the immunological relationship of this disease has been investigated, including the inactivation of enzyme therapies by antibodies and systemic inflammation. We present the case of a 15-year-old patient with FD and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). A narrative review was conducted by searching PubMed with the terms \"Fabry disease\" AND \"vasculitis\" AND \"glomerulonephritis,\" identifying 9 relevant articles. These cases were compared with the current one, emphasizing pathophysiological aspects. 75% of patients had fever, 50% had peripheral edema, and 25% had otorhinolaryngological involvement. Pauci-immune necrosis was found in 75%. Therapeutically, all cases were treated with plasmapheresis, 75% with cyclophosphamide, and only one case required hemodialysis during follow-up. The association of FD with vasculitis is rare, with only five cases, only one with positive ANCA. The role of the immune system in FD, still not fully understood, seems to contribute significantly to pathogenesis and complications. This case highlights the need for further research on the immunological role in FD and its relationship with vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases."

    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a hallmark symptom in Fabry disease (FD), a hereditary X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a reduced activity of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). The α-Gal A deficiency results in the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in the body fluids and lysosomes of various cell types, including sensory ganglia. The FD neuropathy affects the small thinly myelinated Aδ fibers and unmyelinated C fibers leading to the loss of intra-epidermal neuronal terminations, along with altered thermal and mechanical perception. Lipid accumulation, such as Gb3 and lyso-Gb3, is implicated in various cellular dysfunctions, including the alteration of ionic currents. It has been shown that administration of Gb3 to human umbilical vein endothelial cells leads to the downregulation of the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel K<sub>Ca</sub>3.1, whereas lyso-Gb3 evokes cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and an enhancement of voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in murine dorsal root ganglia. Therefore, we examined the mechanism underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in primary afferent neurons from the α-Gal A (-/0) mouse model. The obtained results suggest that other transport proteins participate in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in FD and their dysfunction may be directly involved in nociception. In this context, plasma-membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases exhibited reduced activity in FD, leading to an increased resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in sensory neurons. The reduced activity was associated with a decrease of cytosolic pH which weakened the PMCA-dependent calcium extrusion. We finally evaluated the contribution of mitochondria to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling and we observed impairment of the mitochondrial buffer capacity, as well as dysfunctional mitochondria and enhanced autophagy/mitophagy. These findings provide a basis for future insights into the alterations of calcium signalling underlying the onset of neuropathic symptoms in FD."

Eligible studies included human research on clinical manifestations and methods for screening, diagnosing, and monitoring FD, such as experimental and quasi-experimental studies, observational research, reviews, and guidelines. We followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines for screening and data extraction. We analyzed data with descriptive statistics and qualitative synthesis. We included 383 studies, with cross-sectional designs being the most common (N:=155, 41%). Most studies were from high-income countries, and 199 (52%) did not report patients' phenotypes. Screening methods often combined clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings. Specifically, 14 studies (4%) focused on newborn screening. Clinical symptoms were described in 315 studies (82%) and were instrumental in diagnostic investigation. While hallmark manifestations were prevalent, less-recognized symptoms like tinnitus, early stroke, cerebrovascular dolichoectasia, conduction disorders, aortic root dilatation, and parapelvic cysts, were highlighted as important in clinical suspicion. Laboratory, particularly α-Gal A measurement (N.=183, 48%), and genetic sequencing were fundamental to diagnosis confirmation. Follow-up assessments concentrated on cardiovascular, genitourinary, and nervous systems, employing imaging and electrophysiological studies, along with various scales and questionnaires. This review provides a comprehensive overview of screening, diagnostic, and monitoring strategies for FD, offering evidence-based insights to improve the clinical management of FD patients."

    "abstract": "Diagnostic work-up of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is crucial for appropriate management. However, the optimal genetic strategy remains debatable. We compared two strategies: targeted testing based on careful examination of clinical red flags versus large multigene panel analysis without gene prioritization. We applied the strategy to the diagnosis of Fabry disease or Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis (GLA or TTR genes respectively). We studied 341 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy index patients. Patients of subgroup 1 (n = 42) had careful clinical analysis and high suspicion of Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis or Fabry disease. They underwent targeted Sanger sequencing. Patients in subgroup 2 (n = 299) did not have clinical selection, and underwent next-generation sequencing analysis of 107 cardiac genes. The yield of genetic testing for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in GLA and/or TTR was 28.6% in subgroup 1 (12/42: 5 TTR and 7 GLA) versus 1.0% in subgroup 2 (3/299: 1 TTR and 2 GLA), p < 0.01. Genetic results were obtained after a median of 26.0 days [IQR = 18-59.8] in subgroup 1 versus 193.5 days [IQR = 174-218] in subgroup 2, p < 0.01. Finally, genetic testing cost was 615.60€ or 769.50€ for TTR or GLA targeted analysis respectively, versus 1503.90€ for multigene panel analysis. Both molecular strategies in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients are useful for the identification of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in TTR/GLA genes. However, targeted genetic testing based on clinical red flags identified causal mutations more efficiently, faster and at a lower cost. Careful clinical analysis is therefore important in guiding molecular strategy and may reduce diagnostic wandering and accelerate delivery of appropriate therapy."

It also explored associations between age at diagnosis, Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), genetic mutations, and cardiometabolic risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity. A retrospective observational cohort study of 405 patients with FD was conducted by reviewing medical records from a National Centre over a 20-year period. Clinical outcomes, predominantly cardiovascular, but also severe renal and cerebrovascular events and mortality were assessed. Age at diagnosis, MSSI, and cardiometabolic risk factors were also evaluated. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test and Chi-square test, with significance set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. Nearly half (48 %) of patients experienced a defined clinical outcome. Higher age at diagnosis and baseline MSSI was observed in patients with poorer outcomes. The c.644 A > G (p.N215S) variant was linked with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiometabolic risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and obesity were common in patients with poorer outcomes. A high prevalence of arrhythmia, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), was observed. Multi-morbidity was noted in deceased patients. Use of cardiometabolic therapies in at-risk groups (e.g. sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists) was low. This study highlights the clinical burden of FD, particularly among males with the c.644 A > G (p.N215S) variant. The frequent presence of cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with adverse outcomes reinforces the importance of early diagnosis, comprehensive risk evaluation, and individualised management to improve long-term prognosis."

Anecdotally we observed a higher-than-expected incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in FD patients. Retrospective, observational study at two specialist national centres for lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) in the UK and Netherlands looking after a total of 520 patients with FD, 289 with a classical phenotype and 231 with non-classical 'cardiac variant' phenotype. There were 11/520 (equivalent 70.5/100000/year) incidences in 10 patients with an additional diagnosis of RCC. The median (IQR) age at RCC diagnosis was 55 (39-59) years. 5/10 were identified incidentally. RCC affected 6/289 (2.1 %) patients with classical Fabry disease and 5/231 (2.2 %) with the non-classical phenotype. The median (range) plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration was 21.6 (2.9-95.6 nmol/L). 55 % of RCCs were diagnosed before starting disease modifying treatment, the remaining were diagnosed 5-18 years after the start of treatment. Commonest subtype was clear-cell-RCC (7/11 incidences with 7 patients having WHO/ISUP grade 2 or above tumours. 3 had papillary-RCC (1 had two episodes at age 27 and 39). The annual incidence of RCC in patients with FD was higher than the peak global incidence (70.5 vs 4.6/100000/year) and occurred at a younger age. FD may be an independent risk factor for RCC. This suggests that routine screening for RCC may be beneficial in patients with FD. Fabry disease may be an independent risk factor for renal cell carcinoma. What was known: Renal involvement, primarily progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a well-known manifestation of Fabry disease. This study adds: Our findings indicate a significant increase in RCC among patients with FD. Potential impact: Effective screening tool will be available for patient with this genetic condition and further research into the mechanisms by which GLA gene variants increase RCC risk may enhance our understanding of RCC pathophysiology and inform the development of new therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, leading to substantial personal, economic, and medical costs to patients and society; it is characterized by the build-up of toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau. It is crucial to the health of the brain that these proteins are processed or drained effectively, but mounting research has shown that in AD pathology there is dysfunction in the ability of the brain to effectively clear pathological Aβ and tau. In this report, we detail the involvement of one important brain drainage pathway and potential site of Aβ clearance, the cribriform plate lymphatics, in 24-month old APP/PS1 mice. We show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux is decreased across the cribriform plate area utilizing multiple methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that Aβ aggregates at the cribriform plate - coating surface of olfactory bulbs (OB), olfactory nerve (ON) bundles, and cribriform plate lymphatic endothelial cells (cpLECs). At 24-months, APP/PS1 mice have increased CD45+ cell infiltration and decreased LYVE-1+ vessel area at the cribriform plate, suggesting local inflammation and lymphatic atrophy. Additionally, cpLECs have higher expression of caspase-3 suggesting the decreased LYVE-1 area is due to cellular toxicity resulting in apoptosis. This study demonstrates that the cribriform plate is an important area for further research elucidating its contribution to AD disease pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is an X-linked lysosomal-storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A (<i>GLA</i>). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with AFD and the types of medical specialists necessary to manage them in a prefecture with a population of 1.48 million. We included patients with <i>GLA</i> variants among patients diagnosed by genetic testing with AFD and managed at Shiga University of Medical Science from April 2010 and May 2024. The clinical information and data of the specialists engaged for the management of the patients were obtained from their medical records. In this study, 14 individuals from five families (four males, 29 %) were diagnosed with AFD. The age at diagnosis ranged from 9 to 68 years (mean age 38 ± 20 years). The estimated prevalence in the prefecture was 0.99 per 100,000 people, 0.57 per 100,000 males, and 1.39 per 100,000 females. They received treatment by specialists from eight different departments, and the average number of departments in which they were managed was 3.3 overall, 4.2 for males, and 2.9 for females. The family history and genetic testing are useful for the precise diagnosis and treatment of patients with AFD. As such patients require interdisciplinary treatment, interdepartmental cooperation should be promoted for their systemic care."

    "title": "Nonsense Mutations in Rare and Ultra-Rare Human Disorders: An Overview.",
    "abstract": "Over 7000 rare diseases have been described, collectively affecting 350 million people worldwide. Most of these conditions result from nonsense mutations, representing approximately 10% of all genetic mutations associated with human inherited diseases. Nonsense mutations convert a sense codon into a premature termination codon (PTC), leading to premature translation termination and the production of truncated, nonfunctional proteins. This results in a loss-of-function phenotype in many genetic disorders, contributing to the disease's severity and progression. The molecular mechanisms of PTC formation involve various genetic alterations, including single-nucleotide changes, frameshifts, and splicing mutations. The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). In contrast, 25% of PTC mRNAs, depending on the PTC position and cellular context, can evade NMD, resulting in the synthesis of truncated proteins. A termination codon during translation is essential for proper protein synthesis, and translational readthrough-a process in which the ribosome bypasses the PTC and reaches the natural stop codon-may restore some level of protein function. The effectiveness of readthrough depends on the surrounding genetic context and the type of amino acid incorporated at the PTC position. This review aims to explore the molecular characteristics of nonsense-related diseases (NRDs), including cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, Fabry disease, choroideremia, Usher syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and certain hereditary neuropathies and cancers."

    "title": "Multimodal dynamic retinal vessel analysis offers new insights in microvascular defects in Fabry's disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry's Disease (FD) is one of many disorders that result in altered vascular function. With the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA, IMEDOS Systems), retinal vessels can be recorded non-invasively in real time and dynamic responses to stimuli that affect vessel diameter can be directly visualized. The data obtained can be further mathematically evaluated in terms of dynamic time- and location-dependent vessel behavior. This principle of multimodal analysis of dynamic retinal vascular behavior has been applied to demonstrate specific structural and functional retinal microvascular changes in Fabry's disease. The retinal vascular response was examined with DVA in 10 patients with FD, 4 women, 6 men including 1 child aged 42.5 (34.3-57.3) years (median (1st quartile-3rd quartile)) and in 10 age- and sex-matched healthy participants. The vessel width of an arterial and a venous retinal vessel segment of ~ 1 mm in length was examined in all participants. After 50 s of baseline observation, a monochromatic rectangular luminance flicker (530-600 nm; of 12.5 Hz frequency) was applied three times for 20 s. The vascular response to flicker light was analyzed. Using mathematical signal analysis, the longitudinal microstructure of retinal vessels was assessed and unstimulated vessel wall oscillations were characterized. Group comparisons were performed exploratively using Mann-Whitney-U test. The entire patient group showed no significant difference in response to the flicker light compared to the control group. After dividing the patient group by sex, male patients with FD showed significantly larger arterial dilatation of 6.3 (5.6-7.9)% compared to age-matched controls: 3.3 (2.5-4.1)%, p < 0.01. In contrast, female patients showed a reduced arterial response of 3.4 (3.1-3.7)% compared to age-matched controls: 5.4 (4.0-6.7)%, p = 0.1. When analyzing the periodicity of the spontaneous unstimulated vessel wall modulation, female Fabry patients had a higher and less scattered periodicity of vasomotions in arteries and veins, while male patients showed lower periodicity of vasomotions in arteries with more scattered periods and longer more scattered periods in veins, compared to age-matched controls. The cardiac rhythm was more aperiodic and less pronounced in male patients. In addition, the longitudinal microstructure of retinal arteries and veins in FD was structurally and functionally altered. This was particularly notable in veins at all stages of the vascular reaction and in arteries at all stages except the baseline by more pronounced waves with periods of ~ 50-100 µm. Multimodal dynamic retinal vessel analysis conveys information about different aspects of vascular regulatory potential. The flicker provoked retinal arterial response is more pronounced in male patients with FD. This reaction is nitric oxide (NO) mediated and conveyed by the vascular endothelial cells. With an altered baseline smooth muscle activity in vessel walls subsequent reactions to vascular stimuli such as flicker light for the retina may be more pronounced in the imbalanced system of male Fabry patients. Spontaneous retinal vessel oscillations are altered in Fabry's disease. These alterations are more dramatic in male patients, and are especially characterized with less periodic vessel behavior over the large frequency range. This is a result of altered smooth muscle reaction potentially due to disease mediated altered potassium channel activity. Both arterial and venous retinal vessel walls in FD show peculiar microstructural changes. The characteristic microirregularities of retinal vessels are of functional nature in arteries and rather of structural nature in veins. The DVA examination with multimodal retinal vessel analysis represents a practical possibility to investigate central microvascular status of Fabry's disease in more detail and might elucidate the effect of potential therapeutic interventions."

As opposed to the usual diffuse heterogenous late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) seen in cases of cardiac amyloidosis, the patient had localized LGE in the inferolateral left ventricular wall classically resembling Anderson Fabry's disease. However, other cardiac magnetic resonance features raised the suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis which was later confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. This case highlights that cardiac amyloidosis can have atypical imaging features that may lead to incorrect diagnosis.

We present a case of a 71-year-old male with late-onset Fabry disease whose diagnosis was delayed due to the absence of typical symptoms. The patient has a history of nephrotic syndrome and is currently suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. He was previously diagnosed with diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy and heart block. Upon admission, cardiac examination revealed reduced longitudinal strain of the left ventricle. Fabry disease was suspected due to recurrent heart failure, persistent slight elevation in troponin I (TNI) levels, recurrent syncope, and hearing loss. Subsequent measurement of α-galactosidase A activity and genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of considering Fabry disease in patients with renal failure, recurrent heart failure, persistent slight elevation in TNI levels, and bilateral interventricular septum syndrome."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficient or reduced α-galactosidase A activity, resulting in the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in vascular endothelial cells. Although traditionally considered an X-linked recessive disorder predominantly affecting the male population, the heterozygous female population frequently develops significant clinical manifestations. Pregnancies complicated by Fabry disease are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and exacerbation of Fabry disease-specific symptoms. While enzyme replacement therapy and chaperone therapy have revolutionized disease management, the rarity of Fabry disease has precluded the establishment of consensus guidelines for pregnancy management. We present a case of successful maternal and perinatal management in a pregnant woman with Fabry disease who maintained α-galactosidase A therapy throughout pregnancy, accompanied by a comprehensive literature review of 21 additional cases. Our review revealed predominantly favorable outcomes with enzyme replacement therapy during pregnancy, with lower rates of proteinuria (9.1% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.01) compared to historical Fabry disease cases without enzyme replacement therapy. Common prepregnancy symptoms included proteinuria (45.5%), limb pain (40.9%), and acroparesthesia (31.8%), with symptom exacerbation during pregnancy including renal dysfunction (13.6%) and limb pain (9.1%) despite continued therapy. Pregnancy complications included hypertensive disorders (13.6%), preeclampsia (9.1%), and preterm delivery (9.1%). No congenital anomalies were reported among the newborns. Our findings suggest that enzyme replacement therapy can be safely maintained during pregnancy with careful monitoring and multidisciplinary management involving Fabry disease specialists for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes."

We hypothesised that patients with Fabry disease would have a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus compared with the general population. A cross-sectional study. Taiwan. We identified a study sample from Taiwan's LHID2010 Database. There were 9408 sampled patients in this study, 2352 study patients with Fabry disease and 7056 propensity-score-matched comparison patients. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between diabetes mellitus and Fabry disease after taking the variables of age, sex, geographic location, monthly income category, urbanisation level of the patient's residence, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension into consideration. The results revealed significantly higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus among patients with Fabry disease than among comparison patients (35.8% vs 29.6%, p<0.001). The difference was observed, irrespective of gender, males 37.0% vs 30.6%, (p<0.001) and female patients, 34.8% vs 28.7% (p<0.001). The adjusted OR of diabetes mellitus for patients with Fabry disease was 1.424 (95% CI=1.276~1.591) when compared with comparison patients. Classified by sex, the adjusted ORs for diabetes were 1.428 (95% CI=1.213~1.682) for males and 1.424 (95% CI=1.226~1.655) for females. Additionally, among patients aged <65 years, the adjusted OR was 1.489 (95% CI=1.277~1.737), and among patients aged 65 or older, the adjusted OR was 1.361 (95% CI=1.161~1.596). Our findings suggest the importance of screening for diabetes mellitus in patients with Fabry disease. Physicians should be conscious of this association and be prepared to manage both conditions concurrently."

    "abstract": "Adult-onset neurogenetic diseases (NGDs) with white matter abnormalities are rare and often misdiagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) due to overlapping clinical and radiological features. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary immunosuppressive treatments and delayed genetic counseling. This study combines a retrospective multicenter analysis with a systematic review of the literature to assess the characteristics of patients with NGDs misdiagnosed as MS (Mis-MS) or with coexisting MS (NGD-MS), with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy. The retrospective study was conducted across seven tertiary MS centers in Europe and North America. Patients with confirmed NGDs initially misdiagnosed as MS or with coexisting MS were included. Clinical, radiological, and genetic data were analyzed. Brain MRIs were evaluated for MS-consistent and atypical features using standardized criteria. A systematic literature review of NGDs mimicking MS was also performed. The retrospective study included 46 patients (37 Mis-MS, 9 NGD-MS). Common NGDs in Mis-MS were Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) (22 %), Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia (ALSP) (8 %), and Adult-onset Alexander Disease (AOAD) (5 %). NGD-MS cases were primarily mitochondrial disorders (67 %). The median diagnostic delay for NGDs was nine years. Despite 80 % of Mis-MS patients showing atypical MRI features, 41 % met MS dissemination in space and 20 % dissemination in time criteria. CSF oligoclonal bands were absent in 92 % of Mis-MS patients but present in 83 % of NGD-MS patients. Literature review identified 81 Mis- MS and 22 NGD-MS cases, with Fabry disease and CADASIL most frequently involved. Diagnosing NGDs that mimic MS is challenging. CADASIL, ALSP, and AOAD were the most commonly misdiagnosed neurogenetic diseases as MS. Vasculopathies like CADASIL are challenging to differentiate from MS due to similar clinical and imaging features, including remitting course and gadolinium enhancement. Recognizing atypical MRI patterns and integrating clinical and genetic evaluations can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care by preventing unnecessary MS treatment and enabling timely genetic counseling."

    "title": "Enzyme replacement therapy using a modified α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase to suppress progressive glycolipid accumulation and escape from antidrug antibody formation in young human NAGA-transgenic/Gla-knockout mice.",
    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant human α-galactosidase A (AGAL) is a standard therapy for Fabry disease. However, systemic reviews have reported that recurrent injection of the enzyme can induce the formation of harmful antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in male patients with Fabry disease. Unfortunately, to date no recommended ERT drugs facilitating escape from ADA formation have yet been established. Accordingly, we focused on α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (NAGA), which has a protein structure that is similar to that of AGAL. Previously, we had prepared a modified NAGA (p. S188E and p. A191L) and determined the biochemical properties of the new enzyme. In this study we verified the efficacy of the modified NAGA, both in silico and via cell and animal experiments. The molecular dynamics simulation results suggested that the enzyme has an affinity for α-D-galactose (α-Gal) as a ligand. Moreover, these results also suggested that the modified NAGA may hydrolyze the terminal α-Gal moieties of glycoconjugates. The cell experiments revealed that the modified NAGA incorporated into cultured Fabry fibroblasts was more stable than recombinant human AGAL, despite the specific enzyme activity of the former being lower than that of the latter. Additional animal experiments revealed that human NAGA-transgenic/Gla-knockout mice were tolerant of recurrent administration of the modified NAGA, and that the modified NAGA notably did not induce the formation of ADAs. Moreover, the enzyme also suppressed the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in organs/tissues, thereby improving morphological changes in young mice. Overall, these findings suggest that the modified NAGA is a promising ERT drug candidate for patients with Fabry disease, especially for those who are likely to produce anti-AGAL antibodies."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of urinary myeloid bodies in Fabry disease patients and their correlation with renal involvement remains unclear. This single-center, retrospective study included 25 patients with Fabry disease and 27 controls. We analyzed 24-h urine samples for the presence of urinary myeloid bodies and evaluated clinical data, including serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 24-h urinary protein levels, α-Gal A, and Lyso-GL-3. Seven Fabry patients underwent analysis of urine samples before and after 1 year of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Urinary myeloid bodies were detected in 84% of Fabry patients (21 out of 25), with no significant gender differences. None of the healthy controls or patients with other renal disease patients had urinary myeloid bodies. Among the Fabry patients with myeloid bodies, 48% had no proteinuria, and 52% were in CKD1 stage G1. Furthermore, urinary myeloid bodies were detected in 4 patients under the age of 20, despite the absence of or only minimal proteinuria, and these patients all exhibited a substantial number of myeloid bodies. After 1 year of ERT, significant reductions in both the count (<i>p</i> = 0.043) and area ratio (<i>p</i> = 0.028) of myeloid bodies were observed. Urinary myeloid bodies are specific to Fabry disease and are associated with early renal injury, even in the absence of proteinuria. These findings suggest that urinary myeloid bodies may serve as a noninvasive biomarker for the early diagnosis of Fabry disease and for monitoring the efficacy of ERT."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A enzyme deficiency, resulting in multiorgan accumulation of glycosphingolipid. Cardiac accumulation leads to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis, and sudden cardiac death. Advances in transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) have enabled the detection of subclinical atrial and ventricular cardiomyopathy. Until now, studies assessing changes on TTE in FD have been small and cross-sectional. To understand longitudinal changes, our aim was to quantify trends in TTE parameters, linked to relevant physiological and biochemical parameters. A single-centre retrospective study was conducted of 75 FD patients who received longitudinal follow-up care (53% female, 57% on enzyme replacement therapy) between 2011 and 2023. Longitudinal follow-up care demonstrated increasingly impaired left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), tissue Doppler imaging, and right ventricular systolic function. Atrial changes included increasingly impaired left atrial GLS, greater volumes, and reduced left atrial ejection fraction and fractional area change. A sex-specific increase occurred in indexed left ventricular mass in male patients. Biochemical changes included increases in high-sensitivity Troponin-T and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. A sex-specific increase in the urine protein level and the albumin-creatinine ratio in male patients. TTE and biochemical trends highlight the gradual and insidious nature of FD progression, and stress the importance of considering multiparametric endpoints, including GLS, atrial function, and biomarkers, when assessing outcome in FD."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FN are not yet fully understood. Recent advances in transcriptomics have opened new perspectives for the identification of early changes in gene expression associated with the development and progression of the disease. This study includes a systematic review of transcriptomic findings in chronic kidney disease, with a particular focus on FN, and presents a proof-of-concept RNA sequencing analysis of peripheral blood samples from six Fabry patients with progressive nephropathy and six age- and sex-matched control subjects. The analysis identified 41 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), all of which were upregulated in Fabry patients. Enrichment analysis revealed significant involvement in immune-related pathways, including neutrophil degranulation, interferon, and cytokine signaling. Cell type enrichment revealed that neutrophils and other immune cells are key players in this process. These results suggest that immune and inflammatory mechanisms play a central role in the pathogenesis of FN. The identified DEGs are involved in pro-fibrotic signaling and immune system activation and shed light on possible mechanisms underlying fibrosis, podocyte injury, and kidney damage. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of FN and may facilitate in the identification of early biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring."

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of disorders resulting from defects in enzymes in metabolic pathways. These disorders impact the processing of metabolites, leading to a wide array of effects on each organ system. Advances in genetic screening have allowed for the early identification and intervention of IEMs, traditionally in the form of enzyme replacement or vitamin supplementation. However, many IEMs disrupt essential metabolic pathways where simple supplementation proves ineffective, resulting in substantial disease burden. In the case of renal IEMs, metabolic pathway disruption leads to the onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD). For these diseases, genetic therapy provides hope. Over the past few decades, the technology for genetic therapy has emerged as a promising solution to these disorders. These therapies aim to correct the source of the defect in the genetic code so that patients may live full, unencumbered lives. In this review, we searched a large database to identify IEMs that affect the kidney and investigated the current landscape and progression of gene therapy technology. Multiple promising genetic therapies were identified for IEMs affecting the kidney, including primary hyperoxaluria, argininemia, glycogen storage diseases Ia and Ib, and Fabry disease. Emerging gene therapy approaches using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, lentiviral vectors, and CRISPR/Cas9 techniques hold promising potential to provide curative treatments for additional single-mutation disorders."

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations in gene coding regions introduce an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC) in the mRNA transcript, resulting in the early termination of translation and the production of a truncated, nonfunctional protein. The absence of protein expression and the consequent loss of essential cellular functions are responsible for the severe phenotypes in the so-called genetic nonsense-related diseases (NRDs), such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Fabry disease, Choroideremia, Usher syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and even certain types of cancer. Nonsense mutations pose a significant challenge in the treatment of NRDs, as a specific approach directly addressing this genetic defect is currently unavailable. Developing new therapeutic strategies for nonsense suppression is a crucial goal of precision medicine. This review describes some of the most promising therapeutic approaches and emerging strategies for treating NRDs. It considered both the use of small molecules to interfere with molecular mechanisms related to nonsense mutations, such as translational readthrough-inducing drugs (TRIDs) or inhibitors of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, and also innovative approaches involving nucleic acids, such as gene editing, anticodon engineered-tRNA (ACE-tRNA), or mRNA-based therapy. Future research should focus on refining these approaches and exploring integrated and personalized treatments to enhance therapeutic outcomes and ensure continuous improvement in the quality of care."

    "title": "Current status of the immunogenicity of enzyme replacement therapy in fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "In patients with Fabry disease (FD), treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), may trigger the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The consequences of this immune reaction range from the transient appearance of clinically insignificant ADAs to the generation of neutralizing antibodies that negate the clinical benefit of the biotherapeutic agent, lead to side effects (such as injection site reactions), and even cause severe, life-threatening symptoms. Many factors may influence the immunogenicity of these therapeutic proteins. Currently, there are three commercially available long-term ERT treatments in patients with FD: agalsidase alfa, agalsidase beta, and more recently, pegunigalsidase alfa. Neutralizing ADAs are present in approximately 40% of male FD patients treated with ERT based on agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta and have shown in vitro cross-reactivity with both agalsidases. Their formation seems to be irreversible, meaning that most patients with positive neutralizing ADAs remain so for up to 10 years after starting treatment. Recent studies show that in some patients, pre-existing ADAs against agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta have lower affinity and lower inhibitory effects against pegunigalsidase alfa. Additionally, in clinical trials involving naïve patients, neutralizing antibodies were mostly transient, although further studies are needed to confirm these findings in clinical practice. The formation of ADAs is often associated with a worse clinical prognosis and a faster progression of the disease. Given the rapid progression of FD, measuring ADAs titers is essential to provide personalised treatment for each patient. This is why international recommendations highlight the importance of monitoring the existence of ADAs, their neutralising activity, and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) levels in patients receiving ERT. However, several unresolved issues remain, such as the importance of ADAs levels (particularly neutralising ADAs), the standardisation of assay methods, the interpretation of results, and the implications of these findings for therapeutic strategies. Overcoming the development of ADAs is critical to improving treatment outcomes in patients with FD, different strategies have been explored to address this challenge. The present work aims to review latest developments related to all aspects mentioned above, while also analyzing the potential role of therapeutic innovations."

This study aimed to evaluate the association between multiple plasma biomarkers and disease activity in Fabry disease.

Plasma levels of KIM-1, MCP-1, YKL-40, TNFR-1, TNFR-2, and cystatin-C were measured using ELISA. eGFR was calculated using creatinine and creatinine-cystatin C-based CKD-EPI formulas. Fabry patients on renal replacement therapy were analyzed as a subgroup. Primary analyses focused on 62 Fabry patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy. Although eGFR (cr) did not differ significantly between Fabry patients and healthy controls, eGFR(cr-cys) was significantly lower in Fabry patients. After adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, MCP-1 and TNFR-2 levels were significantly lower in Fabry patients than in CKD patients. Among Fabry patients, those with renal involvement, had significantly higher MCP-1 levels than those without. While KIM-1 and YKL-40 did not differ significantly between groups, both were significantly elevated in patients with Lyso-Gb3 > 4 ng/mL and positively correlated with Lyso-Gb3. MCP-1, TNFR-2, YKL-40, and cystatin C may serve as potential biomarkers for different aspects of Fabry disease activity.

Due to its non-specific manifestations, FD (especially the later-onset variant) is often underdiagnosed [2]. We aimed to estimate its prevalence in a large haemodialysis (HD) population in the UK. This is a cross-sectional, multicentre study of eight renal centres in the UK. All male participants were tested via dried blood spot alpha-galactosidase A (AG) enzyme and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) assays. If either the AG (≤ 2.8 µmol/L/H) or Lyso-Gb3 (≥ 3.5 ng/mL) level was abnormal, genetic testing for GLA variant was performed. All females had AG, Lyso-GB3 and genetic tests. In total, 1325 consented to participate in the study. The mean age of the participants was 64 (SD 15) years, 67% were male, 64% were of white ethnicity, the duration of dialysis was 32 (IQR 56) months, and 32% underwent renal biopsy. Diabetic nephropathy (28%) was the most common cause of ESKD, whereas 21% had an unknown aetiology. A total of 1,295 had both AG and Lyso-Gb3 tests, whereas 573 had GLA genetic tests. Among the 14% (n = 186) with an AG level ≤ 2.8 µmol/L/H, 48 were female and 138 were male, all of whom had Lyso-Gb3 < 3.5 ng/mL. Only 3 (0.2%) had abnormal Lyso-Gb3 but all had normal AG and negative genetic tests. Two females were found to have likely benign, non-pathogenic GLA variants: heterozygous c.937G > T (p.(Asp313Tyr) and heterozygous c.1102G > A (p.(Ala368Thr)). Despite the implementation of stringent screening criteria, we did not identify any new confirmed cases of Fabry disease in this large UK haemodialysis population."

    "title": "Evolution of Cardiac Damage Staged With Echocardiography in Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease can be classified in 4 stages based on the extent of cardiac damage assessed with echocardiography. This staging is strongly associated with prognosis, with a doubled risk increase of cardiovascular events for each stage progression. The aims of the present study were to investigate the evolution of cardiac damage using this staging system during midterm follow-up and to identify predictors of stage worsening. This is a retrospective, multicenter study, which included 168 patients with Fabry disease (38% men) categorized at baseline and follow-up in 4 stages, defined as follows: stage 0, no cardiac involvement; stage 1, left ventricular hypertrophy; stage 2, left atrial enlargement; and stage 3, ventricular impairment. After a median of 5 years, cardiac stage worsened of at least 1 class in 34 patients (24% of 143 patients in stage 0-2 at baseline), improved in 9 (12% of 73 patients in stages 1-3 at baseline), and remained stable in 125 (74% of the 168 patients enrolled). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (odds ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01-1.09]; <i>P</i>=0.006), male sex (odds ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.54-11.79]; <i>P</i>=0.005), classic phenotype (odds ratio, 4.95 [95% CI, 1.30-18.72]; <i>P</i>=0.018), and renal failure (odds ratio, 10.40 [95% CI, 1.57-68.77]; <i>P</i>=0.015) emerged as independent predictors of cardiac damage stage deterioration. Fabry disease is associated with a high rate of progression of cardiac damage during midterm follow-up, with ≈24% of patients experiencing cardiac stage worsening. Age, male sex, classic phenotype, and renal failure are independent predictors of stage progression."

    "title": "Diagnosis of Inherited Metabolic Disease in Older Patients: A Systematic Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) are genetic disorders that disrupt biochemical processes in the human body, due to pathogenic variants in genes encoding enzymes or transporters. While IMDs are mostly diagnosed in infancy or childhood, there is an increasing number of diagnoses in adult patients. Delayed diagnosis, particularly in older patients, may reflect the diagnostic odyssey usually observed in rare diseases' patients and can result in complications and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. The aim of the study was to better characterize the diagnosis of IMDs in older patients (≥ 65 years). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine the diagnosis and clinical presentation of IMDs in patients aged 65 and older. We searched databases like PubMed, Embase, and Lilacs for relevant studies from 1965 to 2023. A total of 260 articles were included, representing 293 patients with a median age of 69 years at diagnosis. From this SLR, 67 different diagnoses have been reported. The most frequently reported diseases were Fabry disease, alkaptonuria, Gaucher disease, mitochondrial disorders, and glycogen storage disease type V. Median diagnostic delay was 14.5 years with a wide range of 1-91 years. Musculoskeletal symptoms were the most frequently reported, followed by neurological and cardiovascular symptoms. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing IMDs in older patients and the need for awareness among healthcare providers to improve diagnosis and patient care. Future guidelines and teaching programs should incorporate metabolic investigations for older patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IMDs."

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To summarize the characteristics of Fabry's disease with cardiac involvement. <b>Methods:</b> This was a single-center, cross-sectional, retrospective study. Patients with Fabry disease who were admitted to Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University from January 2022 to March 2023 were included. Clinical data, laboratory results, electrocardiogram, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance findings of enrolled patients were collected. Clinical presentations and imaging features of patients with Fabry's disease with cardiac involvement were summarized and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 17 patients from 8 families were included, with 9 males and diagnosis age of (44.35±13.72) years. Cardiac involvement and other organ involvement were presented in all patients and the heart was the most vulnerable organ (17/17). 24 h electrocardiogram showed frequent sinus arrhythmia in 3 patients. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 1 patient, myocardial hypertrophy in 13 patients, and left ventricular wall thickness ≥13 mm in 10 patients. Mitral regurgitation was observed in 11 patients and tricuspid regurgitation in 12 patients. Two patients underwent two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography, both revealing reduced regional longitudinal strain of the left ventricle, primarily in the basal segments. Cardiac magnetic resonance showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in 2 patients, myocardial hypertrophy in 16 patients, and left ventricular wall thickness≥13 mm in 14 patients. T1 value was reduced in 16 patients, with late gadolinium enhancement observed in 9 patients and \"pseudo-normalization\" of T1 values in 1 patient. The most susceptible target organ besides the heart was the kidneys (14/17), followed by the central nervous system (9/17). Additional findings inclucling cutaneous angiokeratoma in 4 patients, peripheral neuropathy with burning pain and hypohidrosis or hyperhidrosis in 6 patients, and corneal vortex opacities in 2 patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> The main manifestations of cardiac involvement in Fabry's disease are decreased cardiac function, left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Advanced imaging techniques such as two-dimensional speckle tracking, T1 Mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement are useful in detecting myocardial pathological changes of Fabry's disease."

Clinical data, including medical history, biochemical parameters, echocardiography, and electrocardiogram, were collected from the proband and family members. The proband and his daughter underwent α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) enzyme activity assay and Sanger sequencing of the GLA gene. Candidate variants were analyzed and classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. <b>Results:</b> The male proband (69 years old) presented with chronic renal insufficiency, electrocardiogram findings of ST-T changes, bundle branch block, and left ventricular high voltage, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. His α-Gal A activity was markedly reduced, and genetic testing identified a hemizygous GLA c.511G>C (p.Gly171Arg) variant on the X chromosome. The proband's asymptomatic daughter also exhibited significantly decreased α-Gal A activity and carried the heterozygous GLA c.511G>C (p.Gly171Arg) variant. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, this variant was classified as \"likely pathogenic\" and considered the underlying cause of Fabry disease in this family. <b>Conclusion:</b> The proband manifested chronic renal insufficiency and cardiac hypertrophy, with the GLA c.511G>C (p.Gly171Arg) variant identified as the likely-pathogenic cause of Fabry disease in this family."

    "title": "\"Real world\" medical care of patients with Fabry disease by primary care physicians, internists or general practitioners.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare hereditary X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes. Clinical manifestations vary widely, involving multiple organs. Delays in diagnosis and deficits in primary care are common due to the limited familiarity with this rare disease in primary care providers [PCPs; including general practitioners (GPs), family physicians, and specialists in internal medicine]. This study aims to assess the real-world healthcare situation of FD patients in Germany through a questionnaire-based approach. In this cross-sectional study, 103 FD patients were consecutively recruited from several medical institutions in Germany and Austria between August 2022 and April 2024. The study adhered to ethical guidelines and received approvals from all relevant ethics committees. Inclusion criteria included confirmed FD diagnosis, age 18 years or older, and the ability to provide informed consent. Data were collected using a 32-question survey covering demographics, comorbidities, care structures, information needs, quality of life (QoL), and challenges. Descriptive statistical methods were used for data analysis of the study population. The analysis included 103 completed questionnaires. The average age of the patient cohort was 49.3±16.2 (range, 18-94) years, with a higher proportion of women (61.2%) participating. The most common symptoms reported were hearing loss/tinnitus (45.6%), followed by thermal sensory disturbances and hypohidrosis (43.7%). A majority of PCP (86.4%) were aware of their patients' FD diagnosis. Overall, 61.2% of patients were not primarily treated by their PCP, but in collaboration with Fabry specialists. Only 63.1% of the patients had received care in a FD competence centre. There was a significant need for advice, especially regarding old-age security (40.0%), nutrition/exercise (39.8%), and resilience in everyday life (37.9%). The awareness among patients, that Fabry competence centers exist which are specialized in Fabry treatment, was limited, with only 64.7% of patients being sufficiently informed. Also, knowledge regarding specific FD self-help groups was limited to 61.2% of patients. FD patients reported a reduced mean QoL score of 78.8±16.7, with pain having the most significant impact on QoL (64.1%). Using a novel patient-reported questionnaire, this study reveals for the first time the state of medical care of FD-patients under \"real life\" conditions. This study highlights significant deficiencies in the medical care of FD patients in Germany, including insufficient knowledge of specialized centers and patient organizations, as well as unmet counselling needs. Despite the availability of at least 24 FD competence centers in Germany, many patients remain under the care of GPs who may lack specific knowledge about FD. Since FD is a rare disease, enhanced education for both patients and GPs about FD and about the benefits of specialized care and patient organizations is crucial. Additionally, comprehensive counselling services should be developed to address the various needs of FD patients. Future research should investigate the overall care situations also in other countries to provide a broader understanding and to improve global health care standards for FD patients."

    "abstract": "Orphan diseases comprise a range of disorders that individually affect a small percentage of people, but collectively impact millions of people worldwide. Patients with this disorder often face significant challenges in diagnosis, treatment, and access to care due to their rare nature and limited understanding and treatment options. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the global healthcare in addressing the accessibility of essential treatments and medicines, but still challenges persist particularly related to orphan drugs (to treat rare diseases) in the developing world. The accessibility of orphan drugs remains a major challenge, where patients face barriers such as high costs, limited availability, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. The high cost associated with orphan drugs presents a barrier to affordability for both patients and healthcare systems, causing disparities in access to life-saving treatments. The molecular farming approach utilizing plant-based production systems for recombinant protein production offers a hope for overcoming barriers to orphan drug access in resource-constrained settings. Molecular farming has the potential to produce a wide range of therapeutic proteins and biologics for the treatment of various rare diseases. The FDA approval of plant-derived proteins for the treatment of Gaucher disease (Elelyso) and Fabry disease (Elfabrio) highlights the potential of plant-based expression systems for the development of suitable drugs targeting niche and orphan diseases. This review examines the potential of the plant system in producing orphan drugs and also highlights the opportunities and challenges related to orphan drug manufacturing."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked genetic disorder characterized by the deficiency or absence of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase. This leads to intracellular deposits of sphingolipids in vital organs, making it a multisystemic disease. The aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of genetic diagnosis and multidisciplinary follow-up of patients with FD. This case presents two patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, both carrying the same variant of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) in the GLA gene, with no known relationship between them. Since the genetic counseling consultation, a family segregation study was performed, enabling the redirection of the diagnosis and detection of FD in several symptomatic and asymptomatic relatives. Genetic studies allowed the reclassification of the VUS as probably pathogenic, demonstrating its involvement in the pathology of these patients. Adequate clinical follow-up was provided for these patients, and reproductive genetic counseling was offered to family members. Early diagnosis of FD helps improve patient prognosis. Genetic counseling enables early diagnosis and proper follow-up of FD."

    "abstract": "Anderson Fabry disease (AFD) is an X-linked hereditary lysosomal abnormality that causes the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in body fluids and tissues, leading to progressive organ damage and a shortened life span. More than 1000 mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene have been identified, promoting many different clinical pictures. For this reason, diagnosing AFD can be difficult, especially because of the great diversity of atypical clinical presentations that can simulate the disease. Some of these variants of the <i>GLA</i> gene have been described as non-pathogenic. For example, the D313Y variant is one of the most controversial, even if there are several case reports of D313Y patients presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with AFD without any other etiological explanation. This work aimed to clarify whether the presence of the D313Y variant affects α-Gal A activity and causes AFD symptoms and organ involvement in two patients from different families. The presence of the D313Y variant resulted in clinical manifestations of AFD in both patients and a decrease in alpha-galactosidase activity in the male patient. Two patients (one female and one male) from two unrelated families were examined. Sequencing of all seven <i>GLA</i> exons and the adjacent 5' and 3' exon-intron boundaries identified the D313Y variant in exon 6, as well as the genetic variation g.1170C>T in the flanking 5' UTR in patient 1 only. Our results suggest that the D313Y variant is causative for the disease and that the clinical phenotype can be enhanced by the presence of other variants modulating protein expression."

In this study, clinical data, α-Gal A activity, and GLA gene test results of 311 patients, who were categorized by classical and late-onset phenotypes, ⩽5% and > 5% of the normal mean value of enzyme activity, and truncated and nontruncated mutation groups, were collected. The common clinical manifestations of Fabry disease included acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis/anhidrosis, neuropsychiatric system, and renal and cardiovascular involvement. Multiorgan involvement was higher in males and classical phenotype patients. In both sexes, classical patients commonly presented with acroparesthesia and multiorgan involvement, whereas late-onset patients showed renal, neuropsychiatric, and cardiovascular involvement. Male and classical patients had lower enzyme activity than female and late-onset patients, respectively. Classical males with enzyme activity of ⩽5% of the normal mean level showed higher multiorgan involvement frequency than those with enzyme activity of > 5%, whereas no significant difference was observed among females. Ninety-five gene mutation sites were detected, with significant phenotype heterogeneity in patients with the same mutation. No significant difference in enzyme activity or clinical manifestations was observed between truncated and nontruncated mutations. Overall, male patients with Fabry disease, regardless of classical or late-onset phenotype, have a higher frequency of multiple-organ involvement and lower α-Gal A activity than female patients. α-Gal A activity was closely correlated with clinical symptoms in males but weakly correlated with clinical manifestations in females. The clinical manifestations of patients with the same mutation are heterogeneous, and the correlation between gene mutation and enzyme activity or clinical manifestation is weak."

    "title": "Effect of newborn genomic screening for lysosomal storage disorders: a cohort study in China.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) have a relatively high incidence among rare diseases and can lead to severe consequences if not treated promptly. However, many countries and regions have not included these disorders in their newborn screening programs, resulting in missed early detection, underdiagnosis, and delayed treatment. Newborn genomic screening (NBGS) has shown good screening effectiveness for traditional biochemical screening diseases; however, its effectiveness for LSDs has not yet been evaluated in the general newborn population. To evaluate the outcome of NBGS for LSDs, a cohort study was conducted involving newborns recruited from Nanjing Women and Children's Healthcare Hospital in China from March 18, 2022, to September 21, 2023. All participants underwent NBGS of 15 LSDs (18 genes) via dried blood spots, followed by enzyme activity testing for NBGS-positive individuals. The study calculated the incidence and carrier rates for each LSD though NBGS, as well as the positive screening rate, the false positive rate and the positive predictive value of the screening process. Among 22,687 newborns (11,996 males [52.88%]), 1344 (6.0%) were identified as carriers, and 30 (0.13%) were initially positive for LSDs. Of these, 4 were excluded, 15 were diagnosed as LSD-presymptomatic individuals based on enzyme deficiency and pathogenic variants conforming to inheritance patterns, and 11 remain under follow-up. The estimated combined birth incidence of LSDs in Nanjing was 1/1512, primarily including Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, glycogen storage disease type II, Niemann-Pick disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis type II. Rather than directly comparing NBGS and enzyme activity screening, this study evaluated two sequential screening strategies: (1) NBGS-first with reflex enzyme testing and (2) enzyme activity-first with reflex genomic testing. The NBGS-first strategy demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity, with a significantly lower false positive rate and higher positive predictive values compared to the enzyme-first strategy (P < 0.05). This study highlights the potential of NBGS to enhance early detection of presymptomatic LSD individuals, enabling timely interventions and improving newborn health outcomes. Integrating NBGS into routine newborn screening programs could provide an effective and proactive approach for LSD identification and management."

Speckle tracking echocardiography analysis may be more sensitive in the assessment of myocardial impairment in AFD patients and have prognostic value. Our aim was to evaluate LV and left atrial (LA) dysfunction by traditional and strain parameters in AFD patients and evaluate prognostic utility. Fifty-six AFD patients were age- and sex-matched to 56 healthy controls. LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and LA reservoir strain (LAS<sub>R</sub>) were significantly lower in male (GLS: 19.38[3.21] vs. 17.8[7.0], <i>P</i> = 0.009; LAS<sub>R</sub>: 38.07 ± 6.67 vs. 31.12 ± 6.76, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and female (GLS: 20.58 ± 1.63 vs. 19.29 ± 1.67, <i>P</i> = 0.003; LAS<sub>R</sub>: 38.77 ± 7.43 vs. 33.13 ± 6.06, <i>P</i> < 0.001) AFD patients compared with controls.

LV wall thickness, LAVI<sub>max</sub>, and LV GLS displayed good sensitivity and specificity for adverse cardiac events. A prognostic risk decision tree comprising of these parameters demonstrated good predictive value for adverse events (AUC = 0.910). We demonstrate differences in LV and LA echocardiographic parameters in AFD patients compared with healthy controls, including female AFD patients with normal LV wall thickness. A prognostic risk decision tree stratified AFD patients into three groups with the highest risk group demonstrating more AFD-related adverse events."

    "abstract": "Alpha-mannosidosis is a rare recessive lysosomal storage disorder with progressive multi-systemic impacts. In the absence of standardized monitoring protocols, there is insufficient understanding of disease progression over time. This study explored the evolution of the burden of illness and quality of life (QoL) experienced by patients with alpha-mannosidosis via an international patient and caregiver-based survey. The online survey was distributed to adult patients/caregivers of patients ≥ 10 years old. It included visual analogue scales (VAS; timepoints 5 years ago and now), multiple choice, and open text questions. We report a subset of functional and QoL data: walking ability, pain/discomfort, ability to self-care, and mental health. Analyses include 51 responses from 18 countries: 26 patients were on velmanase alfa enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), seven had been treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and 18 were untreated patients (UP). Over 5 years, VAS scores showed the least decline in walking ability for HSCT patients (+ 0.1 ± 1.9) compared to patients receiving ERT (+ 0.7 ± 1.2) and UP (+ 1.8 ± 2.0). A trend towards improvement in pain was only observed for those on ERT (-0.2 ± 2.0), both for pediatric and adult patients. Ability to self-care improved for patients treated with HSCT (-1.0 ± 1.8) and slightly improved with ERT (-0.3 ± 1.5) but worsened for UP (+ 0.6 ± 0.9). Similarly, a trend towards improvement in mental health scores was observed for patients on ERT (-0.4 ± 2.2). Alpha-mannosidosis is associated with a substantial and progressive burden in UP, including deterioration in walking ability, pain, self-care and mental health. The survey results suggest that treatment with ERT or HSCT may slow this natural progression of alpha-mannosidosis, with these patients following a different disease trajectory to those solely receiving supportive care. This study could inform the natural pathway of alpha-mannosidosis to recognize patients' needs, courses of care, and the design of interventional studies."

    "abstract": "Aim To evaluate the possibilities of screening for Fabry disease (FD) in a particular region of the Russian Federation.Material and methods This was an open prospective non-comparative study. The screening included patients with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy &gt;13 mm without severe hypertension; patients who had suffered stroke without an apparent cause; patients with peripheral pain syndrome associated with distal polyneuropathy with predominant damage to small fibers; patients with signs of FD during physical examination; coarse facial features; angiokeratomas (inner thighs, hands, abdomen, oral mucosa); thermoregulation disorders; chronic kidney disease. Screening for FD in the region was accompanied by educational activities on the diagnosis of the most common rare (orphan) diseases in adults; also, the routing of patients with FD was mapped out. General practitioners and cardiologists also had an opportunity to send dried blood spots directly to reference centers for the diagnosis of FD and other diseases associated with LV hypertrophy.Results Of the 125 patients who underwent the screening, only 4 had a reduced alpha-galactosidase A activity (to 1.71; 0.78; 0.44; 0.60 μmol/l/h), and in one of them, the diagnosis of FD was genetically confirmed. Five patients with \"atypical\" FD were identified during the work on FD diagnostics in the region, due to the improved knowledge about the signs of orphan diseases, as well as the mapped-out patient routing with the possibility to evaluate the panel of enzyme activity and metabolites of the diseases associated with LV hypertrophy.Conclusion During the screening examination of 125 patients with suspected FD, it was possible to confirm the diagnosis in one (0.8%) patient. To increase the effectiveness of screening, it is necessary not only to provide the opportunity for diagnosing enzymes and metabolites, but also to conduct educational programs with the formation of routing for patients with suspected orphan diseases associated with LV hypertrophy."

    "abstract": "Exploiting the protein production capacity of hepatocytes for de novo expression of α-Galactosidase A (α-Gal A) by gene supplementation therapy represents one of the most promising strategies for the treatment of Fabry disease (FD). The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr) has proven to be one of the target receptors of choice for hepatocyte-directed nanomedicines, and natural glycoproteins such as asialofetuin (AF) can be used as specific ligands. Herein, we have developed AF-decorated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), prepared by different techniques and cationic lipid compositions, for restoring the enzyme deficiency in FD by gene supplementation targeted to hepatocytes. After the physicochemical characterization of the vectors, cell association and transfection efficacy were evaluated in vitro in human hepatocytes (Hep G2), and the capacity to increase α-Gal A activity was evaluated in vivo after intravenous administration to α-Gal A knockout mice. The efficacy and targeting effect were conditioned by the type of SLN. In general, vectors containing a mixture of the cationic lipids DOTAP and DODAP showed enhanced transfection efficacy compared to their counterparts without DODAP. The incorporation of AF in the vectors formulated with SLNs prepared with DOTAP and DODAP by hot-melt emulsification significantly improved the efficacy to induce the expression of α-Gal A in hepatocytes in vitro compared to the control without AF. However, the administration to Fabry mice did not result in a significant increase in enzyme activity. The lack of in vitro-in vivo correlation corroborates the need to understand key factors influencing the behavior of non-viral vectors in biological media for nucleic acid therapies, as well as the desirability of in vivo studies in the early stages of pharmaceutical development of nucleic acid delivery systems."

    "title": "The use and performance of lyso-Gb3 for the diagnosis and monitoring of Fabry disease: A systematic literature review.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder in which a lack of alpha-galactosidase (α-Gal A) enzyme activity leads to intracellular accumulation of deacylated globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), and their analogs. Lyso-Gb3, present in the blood and urine of affected patients, has been extensively investigated as a biomarker for FD. This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to comprehensively assess the use of lyso-Gb3 as a biomarker for screening, monitoring, and diagnosis of FD in both real-world and clinical trial settings. An SLR was performed to identify the following outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with FD: lyso-Gb3 testing patterns, lyso-Gb3 levels in subpopulations, performance and accuracy of lyso-Gb3 testing for diagnosis, and lyso-Gb3 testing for monitoring of disease progression or treatment efficacy/effectiveness. Interventional and non-interventional studies published between 1 January 2017 and 3 November 2022 were included. Searches were primarily conducted in MEDLINE and Embase; pragmatic or hand searches were also performed. The methodological quality of included full-text studies was assessed using validated appraisal tools. Extracted data were synthesized qualitatively. The SLR included 83 eligible publications, comprising 71 observational studies and 12 clinical trials. Differences in lyso-Gb3 levels were identified across subpopulations, with several studies reporting higher levels in males versus females. Lyso-Gb3 demonstrated good diagnostic performance in newborns and high-risk patients when used in combination with other markers (α-Gal A activity or GLA variants) but failed to diagnose females with late-onset FD. Reliability and stability across different methods used to measure lyso-Gb3 was high, with a coefficient of variation <10 % for inter- and intra-assay measurements. Several studies identified moderate to strong correlation between plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and cardiac measures, but association with renal measures needs further investigation. Lyso-Gb3 testing demonstrated accuracy in screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of FD in certain subpopulations, particularly males, but considering its lower sensitivity in late-onset female patients, it should be used in conjunction with other tools. Given the reliability of the test, it can be considered a feasible method for monitoring disease progression in FD in individual patients. Several gaps in the literature were identified, warranting further investigation. PROSPERO (CRD42022375141)."

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to compare diagnostic accuracies of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-based left atrial (LA) volumetry and function, including LA strain analysis, for the detection of myocardial impairments in diseases of different etiologies such as hypertensive heart disease, Fabry disease and acute myocarditis. Healthy volunteers (HV, n = 50) and patients with cardiomyopathies (n = 140), including patients with hypertensive heart disease (n = 40), Fabry disease (n = 49), and acute myocarditis (n = 51), underwent CMR at 3 T. Atrial volume and strain analysis based on long-axis cine acquisition was performed using a commercially available post-processing software. Patients exhibited impaired LA reservoir (28.60 ± 9.91 % vs. 41.27 ± 7.54 %), conduit (17.35 ± 7.72 % vs. 26.89 ± 5.25 %) and booster strain (11.30 ± 4.52 % vs. 14.61 ± 4.15 %) parameters compared to HV (all p < 0.001). In contrast, the volumetric values showed no significant difference between patients and HV (p > 0.05). Passive and total emptying fractions were significantly lower in patients (p < 0.001), while active emptying fraction did not differ (p > 0.05). Superior diagnostic accuracy for the LA reservoir strain demonstrated improved prognostic performance comparing to LA volumetric and functional parameters (area under the curve [AUC] 0.85 vs. e.g. passive emptying fraction AUC 0.78, p < 0.05). LA strain parameters effectively distinguish patients with cardiac diseases presenting overlapping phenotypes from HV and outperform volumetric and traditional functional assessments of the LA."

    "abstract": "This study investigated topographic, aberrometric, and endothelial cell characteristics of the cornea in Fabry disease and compared them to healthy eyes. This prospective, cross-sectional study included 21 patients with Fabry disease and 41 healthy volunteers in Fabry disease (FG) and control (CG) groups, respectively. After ophthalmological examinations, the topographic, tomographic, and aberrometric corneal data were acquired using a Scheimpflug-Placido disk system anterior segment analysis device. The corneal endothelial examination was conducted using a specular microscopy device, and results were compared. A p-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. No significant differences were noted between the age and gender of the groups (p > 0.05). Central and thinnest corneal thickness were significantly lower in the FG than in the CG (p = 0.036 and 0.023, respectively). Although the aberrometric values of the cornea were usually higher in the FG, this difference was not significant. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding corneal endothelial data examined by specular microscopy. When the eye data with cornea verticillata in the FG were compared with those of the CG, anterior higher-order aberrations (HOA) were significantly higher in the FG (p = 0.047) than in the CG. Cornea verticillata associated with Fabry disease can increase HOA in the eye."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare but life-threatening, X-linked, inherited lysosomal storage disorder in which globotriaosylceramide is insufficiently metabolized because of reduced α-galactosidase A activity. Cellular globotriaosylceramide accumulation causes a multisystemic disease, which, if left untreated, reduces life expectancy in female and male individuals by around 10 and 20 years, respectively, leading to progressive renal failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, and premature cerebral infarction. The method of choice for confirming the diagnosis is the determination of reduced α-galactosidase A activity in leukocytes in male individuals and the molecular genetic detection of a disease-causing mutation in female individuals. Current approved treatment includes enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase alfa [0.2 mg/kg body weight], agalsidase beta or pegunigalsidase alfa [both 1.0 mg/kg body weight]) every other week intravenously or, if a responding ('amenable') α-galactosidase A mutation is present, oral pharmacological chaperone therapy (migalastat 123 mg, every other day). Future therapeutic options may include substrate reduction therapy, gene therapy, messenger RNA therapy, and/or vesicle-packaged enzyme replacement therapy. This review presents current and future treatment options with advantages and disadvantages of the different treatment options."

    "title": "Assessing osteopenia and osteoporosis with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry studies in Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare multi-systemic lysosomal storage disease that affects the heart and kidneys most significantly. An underappreciated manifestation of FD is reduced bone mineral density. Currently, there are no specific guidelines for routine bone density assessments, and treatment of osteoporosis and osteopenia in FD. To ascertain the frequency of low bone mineral density in FD we studied dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans obtained as part of routine care from a cohort of 25 individuals followed at the University of California-Irvine Medical Center for the period 2008-2023. The most recent BMD results for the lumbar spine and femoral neck were collected from 12 males and 13 females to examine the prevalence of low bone mineral density. The lowest Z- and/or T-scores of either lumbar spine or femoral neck were selected for analysis. Demographic factors, disease and ERT status, and other laboratory values were collected concurrently (within ± 9 months) with DXA scan results and were analyzed with Z- and T-scores to assess for correlations. In our cohort the mean age was 51 years (median 56 years, range 18-77 years). The Z-scores for all participants and T-scores from postmenopausal women and men ≥ 50-year-old were analyzed and correlated with various measures including disease duration, BMI, renal function (measured by eGFR), plasma GL3, Lyso-GL3, calcium, vitamin D, and alkaline phosphatase levels. These parameters were concurrent with DXA scan results. The average Z-score for all the participants was -1.2 ± 1.3 (range -4.6 to 1.6). Twenty-four percent of all participants (n = 6) had significantly low Z-scores ≤ -2.0. To identify the frequency of subjects with osteopenia, defined as T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 and osteoporosis defined as T-score < -2.5, T-scores were analyzed in postmenopausal women (n = 8) and men 50 years and older (n = 7). Of these 15 individuals, average T-score was -2.2 ± 1.3 (range -5.4 to 0.3), and 86.7% (n = 13) had abnormal results (osteopenia and osteoporosis), 53.3% (n = 8) had osteoporosis and 33.3% (n = 5) had osteoporosis. We found a significant difference in Z-scores between male (-1.98 ± 1.33) and female patients (-.45 ± 0.82) t (23) = 3.487 (p = < 0.001). We did not find any differences in z-scores between different ethnic backgrounds. There was a strong negative correlation between Z-scores and Lyso-GL3 levels [r (15) = -.72, p = .001] and a moderate positive correlation between Z-scores and body mass index (BMI) [r (23) = .43, p = .033]. No correlation was found between Z-scores and calcium levels. There is a strong negative correlation between T-scores and Lyso-GL3 levels [r (8) = -.86, p = .001] and a negative correlation between T-scores and participants' ages at the time of DXA [r (13) = -.57, p = 0.028]. There is a positive correlation between T- scores and calcium levels [r (12) = .58, p = 0.030]. No significant correlation was observed between T-scores and BMI. There was no correlation between Z or T- scores and disease duration, duration of ERT use, renal function (measured by eGFR), GL3, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase levels, or their use of vitamin D or concomitant antiepileptic medications. The findings of this cohort highlight the high prevalence of low bone mineral density in FD and correlations of low Z and T- scores with elevated levels of Lyso-GL3, and low calcium levels. We did not find correlations with renal function, and vitamin D levels. We discuss etiology, prevention, and treatment strategies for osteopenia/osteoporosis in Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic missense and nonsense variants in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, leading to absent or reduced enzyme activity. The resulting lysosomal accumulation of the substrate globotriaosylceramide leads to progressive renal failure, cardiomyopathy with (malignant) cardiac arrhythmias and progressive heart failure as well as recurrent strokes, which significantly limits the life expectancy of patients affected with FD. There is increasing evidence that pathogenic GLA missense variants as well as formally benign GLA variants can cause retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in ER stress, which in turn triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to cellular dysregulation including inflammation, irreversible cell damage, and apoptosis. This review aims to provide an update on the pathogenetic significance of ER stress and UPR in FD, current treatment options, including pharmaceutical and chemical chaperones, and an outlook on current research and future treatment options in FD."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) is a widely used technique for the diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). It analyses over 40 DNA sequences in a single reaction, identifying copy number variations and large deletions/insertions in genes. The diagnostic process in LSDs starts with analysis of the missing or reduced enzyme, followed by genetic investigation and, if possible, a search for accumulated substrates. However, while genetic analysis using Sanger sequencing is excellent at detecting small genetic variations such as single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions or deletions, it cannot detect large deletions or insertions. <b>Methods:</b> In the present study, a total of 800 patients with clinical suspicion of Fabry, Gaucher, or Pompe diseases were investigated. An enzyme assay was carried out on each patient, followed by genetic analysis using PCR, Sanger sequencing, and MLPA. <b>Results:</b> Nine patients with deficient or absent enzyme activity had Sanger sequencing results that could not confirm the molecular genetic diagnosis because either no mutation (Fabry) or only one mutation (Gaucher and Pompe) was identified. Subsequent analysis by MLPA identified two males with a hemizygous deletion and two females with a heterozygous deletion for FD. For PD, one female and two males had a heterozygous deletion. For GD, one male had a homozygous deletion and one female had a heterozygous deletion. The remaining patients were analyzed by MLPA with negative results. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results obtained suggest that MLPA should be used in combination with classical sequencing methods to ensure a correct and timely diagnosis of LSDs."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, leading to α-galactosidase A deficiency and subsequent accumulation of glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), in multiple organs. This accumulation can result in multisystemic disease and life-threatening complications. FD presents with a broad phenotypic spectrum, ranging from the classic form, with early and severe symptoms, to a later-onset form with variable manifestations. The severity of the disease in females is more variable due to X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Renal involvement is a key feature, and kidney biopsy remains a valuable tool for diagnosing FD and assessing the extent of nephropathy. Although molecular genetic testing is the gold standard for diagnosis, kidney biopsy aids in confirming renal involvement, detecting coexisting conditions, and determining the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). Moreover, kidney biopsy can serve as a prognostic tool by identifying early markers of nephropathy, such as foot process effacement and glomerular sclerosis, which predict disease progression. Emerging technologies, including machine learning, offer the potential to enhance the analysis of renal histology, improving diagnostic accuracy and patient stratification. Despite the challenges posed by overlapping diseases and potential misdiagnoses, kidney biopsy remains an essential component of FD diagnosis and management, facilitating early detection, the monitoring of disease progression, and the evaluation of therapeutic responses."

Clinical features include cholestasis, diarrhea, cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and neurological deterioration. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is the standard treatment for CTX. The effects of CDCA withdrawal on CTX biomarkers and safety in adult patients were evaluated. Patients (≥16 years) received CDCA 750-mg/day for 2 8-week open-label periods followed by double-blinded (DB) CDCA or placebo for 2 4-week periods. Key endpoints included changes from baseline in CTX biomarkers (23S-pentol, cholestanol, 7αC4, 7α12αC4) and the proportion of patients requiring CDCA rescue during DB periods. CDCA withdrawal resulted in a 20-fold increase in 23S-pentol and increases in cholestanol (2.8-fold), 7αC4 (50-fold), and 7α12αC4 (14-fold). During the DB withdrawal periods, 61% of participants on placebo required rescue medication. CDCA treatment was well tolerated; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea and headache, most of them mild/moderate in severity and not considered treatment related. CDCA withdrawal caused statistically significant increases in CTX biomarkers and necessitated rescue therapy in most participants. CDCA treatment is critical for control of biochemical abnormalities and helps avoid disease progression."

    "abstract": "About a quarter of patients with locally advanced colon cancer (pT4) develop locoregional recurrence, including peritoneal metastases. The aim of this individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) was to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with regard to reducing the locoregional recurrence rate in the overall population and high-risk subgroups of patients with locally advanced colon cancer. A systematic literature search was conducted in July 2024 to identify RCTs on adjuvant HIPEC in addition to routine adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in locally advanced colon carcinoma. An IPDMA was performed, with the locoregional recurrence rate as the primary endpoint and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. The search identified two trials (COLOPEC and HIPECT4). Individual patient data were pooled for 386 patients, of whom 189 patients received adjuvant HIPEC and 197 patients constituted the control group. The median follow-up was 36 (interquartile range 32-60) months. A modified intention-to-treat analysis showed a 36-month locoregional recurrence rate of 16.0% for HIPEC patients and 21.2% for control patients (P = 0.295). Predefined subgroup analyses revealed a significant reduction in locoregional recurrence after HIPEC in patients with right-sided tumours (HR 0.56 (95% c.i. 0.48 to 0.67)) (P < 0.001). No significant differences in survival were found for the overall study population; low event rates in subgroups did not allow for survival analyses. Adjuvant HIPEC significantly reduced the locoregional recurrence rate in right-sided locally advanced colon cancer, but not in the overall study population. Definitive conclusions on DFS and OS require longer follow-up."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked genetic condition caused by variants in the GLA gene, leading to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) and the accumulation of complex glycosphingolipids such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3). The systemic disorder primarily affects the cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems, resulting in decreased life expectancy. The timing of treatment initiation and optimal dosing play crucial roles in improving outcomes and quality of life in Fabry patients. Available FD treatments include enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa, aglasidase beta, and pegunigalsidase alfa, as well as oral chaperone therapy with migalastat, which can all stabilize or reduce the disease burden. This review focuses exclusively on newly available drugs and future therapeutic approaches for treating FD, including migalastat, pegunigalsidase alfa, substrate reduction therapy (SRT), and gene therapy. Migalastat provides benefits such as oral administration and non-immunogenicity; however, it is only appropriate for patients with \"amenable\" GLA variants. The recently approved pegunigalsidase alfa is a pegylated form of α-Gal A manufactured in plant cell cultures, with apparent reduced immune response and prolonged circulating half-life. SRT (venglustat, lucerastat) reduces Gb3 synthesis, helping to normalize metabolic processes while offering certain advantages such as oral administration, non-immunogenic properties, and the possible crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Clinical trials in human and animal model studies are currently investigating ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy techniques, showing positive early outcomes. The ongoing development of novel treatments for FD suggests that patients will soon have access to a wider array of therapies, enabling more individualized care approaches. Although a definitive FD cure has not been achieved and the expense of combining therapies remains challenging, new therapeutic options such as gene and mRNA-based treatments show promise, though more research is needed."

Their pathophysiology includes cerebral lesions, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation as well as brain-gut axis microbiota dysbiosis. Preclinical investigations demonstrated that brain photobiomodulation (bPBM) reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, increases cerebral blood flow and enhance neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which makes bPBM a promising treatment in AD and PD. This review focuses on the clinical application of bPBM in AD and PD. It aims to provide a scientific overview of the current clinical knowledge, review recent clinical studies findings, and describe future directions and upcoming clinical studies. So far, several clinical studies investigated bPBM therapy, at various parameters, both in patients with AD and related dementia, and PD. All demonstrate bPBM safety and bring valuable clinical information regarding efficacy, with particularly promising results in AD. However, their exploratory design and inconsistent quality lead to a low level of evidence, which currently does not support the widespread use of bPBM in clinical practice. Future clinical research should address two gaps: the need for robust double-blinded RCTs vs sham with a higher number of patients and a longer follow-up, and the need for research focusing on dosimetry to determine which bPBM parameters are optimal. The ongoing or unpublished clinical studies on bPBM should fill in this gap."

The purpose of this project is to examine the temporal, anatomical, and geospatial variances in head and neck cancers across Ohio, focusing on disparities between Appalachian and non-Appalachian regions. Data was sourced from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The incidence and mortality rates of HNC across Ohio were identified and sub classified based on anatomical site. Social determinants of health and environmental factors affecting HNC raters were compared between Appalachian and non-Appalachian regions. The incidence (R = 0.9, P < 0.01) and mortality (R = 0.8, P < 0.01) of head and neck cancer increased significantly from 1999 to 2021 and demonstrated a relationship with mortality (R = 0.3, P < 0.01). Adult smoking (R = 0.5, P < 0.001), obesity (R = 0.5, P < 0.001), and dentist rates (R = 0.3, P < 0.01) were associated with HNC rates. Mean mortality was significantly higher for Appalachian (mean = 10.7, SD = 2.6) than non-Appalachian (mean = 8.6, SD = 2.4) regions (P < 0.01) communities. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing modifiable risk factors through smoking cessation, weight management, and dietary improvements. The difference in mortality between Appalachian and non-Appalachian regions underscores the role of geographic and socioeconomic disparities in shaping health outcomes across Ohio."

It is caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene with a consequent deficiency of the enzyme α-galactosidase A, resulting in the pathological accumulation of glycolipids - mainly globotriosyl ceramide (GL-3, GB3) and its deacylated product, globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb-3) - in plasma and in a wide variety of cell types throughout the human body; it is characterized as a chronic, multisystemic disease with progressive evolution, which causes deterioration of the patient's quality of life and decreases survival and life expectancy.In Latin America there are different limitations to the management of patients with Fabry disease, in most countries, access to diagnostic tools and treatment on time is complex and can sometimes suffer delays in its implementation. This situation is due to the high costs to health systems of follow-up and pharmacological therapy for Fabry patients, creating barriers to timely access. Although medical criteria are fundamental in the choice of pharmacological therapy, the final decision should also rely on the patient's choice according to their expectations and the adherence and compliance with the treatment that they are willing to follow. As it has been described, there are currently three therapeutic options, for which the appropriate profile must be defined to achieve the best clinical outcomes, considering that it is a permanent treatment; experts consider that Fabry patients need comprehensive and interdisciplinary management to stop the progression and functional deterioration of the affected organs by its multiple systemic manifestations. In Latin-American countries, it is difficult to guarantee this comprehensive and coordinated management, due to limited public policies related to orphan diseases diagnosis, treatment and follow up.It is considered crucial to structure support networks specialized in Fabry disease and generate partnerships with health institutions and other health system stakeholders, that would articulate and coordinate patients and relatives counseling and management, establish the specific pharmacological treatment to reduce the progression of the disease and the systemic involvement, deciding between the administration of enzyme replacement therapy or the most recent option of oral management with pharmacological chaperone both with proven effectiveness. This will be the decision of the attending physician, who will propose and advise the therapeutic choice that best suits the patient's needs."

The impact of agalsidase alfa treatment on renal, cardiac, morbidity, and mortality outcomes in FOS was compared with untreated external Fabry disease (FD) cohorts. A total of 2171 FOS patients (1014 men, 919 women, 163 boys, 75 girls) received agalsidase alfa (median [range] duration of treatment: 5.38 [0.0-20.8] years). Annual rates of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate improved in treated patients versus untreated external cohorts regardless of sex or baseline urinary protein levels. Annual left ventricular mass index rates were stable in treated patients regardless of sex or baseline left ventricular hypertrophy status, and better than in untreated external cohorts. The mean age at which 50 % of patients had their first composite morbidity event was later in the agalsidase-alfa-treated population than in the untreated external cohort (51.7 vs 41 years [males]; 60.8 vs 53 years [females]). After 24 months of treatment, the probability of a composite morbidity event was ∼34 % in treated patients and ∼ 45 % in untreated patients. Treated patients were older at death than untreated patients (mean [range]: 61.7 [26.2-87.6] vs 50.3 [34.5-70.1] years). The mean age at which 50 % of male patients were still alive was higher in treated patients than in untreated external cohorts (75.5 vs 60.0 years).

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the <i>GLA</i> gene, which encodes for the α-galactosidase A enzyme responsible for degrading globotriaosylceramide. Its deficiency leads to the accumulation of GL3 in lysosomes, resulting in progressive multi-organ involvement, with predilection for the heart and kidneys. Clinical features associated with Fabry disease include acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, corneal whorls, chronic kidney disease, cardiomyopathy, and strokes. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are less known complications, with rare reported cases of avascular necrosis of the hips. We report bilateral avascular necrosis in a 40-year-old-man diagnosed with Fabry at the age of 25 years. He carriers the familiar p.G328V <i>GLA</i> pathogenic variant. His Fabry features includes acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, temperature and exercise intolerance, pain crises, abdominal pain and diarrhea, tinnitus, hearing loss, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, palpitations, and chest pain. Family history reveals Fabry disease affecting multiple maternal relatives. The patient was recently diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the right hip requiring total arthroplasty due to failure of conservative treatment. Nine months later, he developed left hip pain attributed to avascular necrosis, also treated with total arthroplasty. This case highlights a rare skeletal complication of Fabry disease, underscoring the need for early diagnosis, optimizing treatment of Fabry disease, managing atypical comorbidities, and vigilant monitoring of bone health."

Lethal ventricular arrhythmia is the most common cause of sudden death in patients with Fabry disease. We herein report a case of a man in his 40s with late-onset Fabry disease who had polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation during enzyme replacement therapy. After recovery from successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we recommended implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; however, the patient refused to undergo implantation at that time. We administered a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator at his discharge, and he was successfully rescued from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. He was finally given an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. In Fabry disease, lethal ventricular arrhythmia is an important cause of sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation during enzyme replacement therapy have not been reported. Furthermore, secondary prevention of lethal ventricular arrhythmia using a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator has not been reported in Fabry disease. Therefore, this case report has implications for the possible incidence and prevention of lethal ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "This paper reviews biomarkers in lysosomal disease according to their categories and definitions. There are numerous biomarkers in lysosomal diseases. Some are disease or organ-specific, but most are not. Organ-specific biomarkers are especially useful, but most biomarkers help with diagnosis, assessing disease severity, prognosis, and pharmacodynamic response. There are as yet no truly validated biomarkers in lysosomal diseases by the Prentice, Fleming, and DeMets criteria. None so far can serve as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, or as substitutes for clinically meaningful endpoints that evaluate how patients feel, function, or survive. The US Food and Drug Administration has thus far used surrogate biomarkers to license therapy only for 3 lysosomal diseases-Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and lysosomal lipase deficiency. The paucity of surrogate biomarkers reflects success in using clinically important endpoints for the licensing of therapies for Pompe disease, mucopolysaccharidosis IVA, VI, and VII, Niemann-Pick type C, and CLN2. In conclusion, biomarkers in lysosomal diseases are best used for diagnosis, patient categorization, pharmacodynamic response, and sometimes for patient prognosis and risk. Thus far, they have been less useful as surrogate biomarkers in pivotal clinical trials."

This study examined CMBs in FD and identified their association with clinical parameters. We retrospectively enrolled patients with FD followed up at two medical centers in Taiwan. All underwent brain MRI, including susceptibility-weighted imaging. CMB distribution was determined using the Microbleed Anatomical Rating Scale framework. Among the 26 enrolled patients (mean age: 55.8 years, 92 % men), 22 received regular enzyme replacement therapy before MRI. The median [interquartile] Fazekas score for periventricular and deep white matter was 1 [0,1] and 1 [1,1], respectively. CMBs were detected in 16 (62 %) patients, with 94 % (n = 15) exhibiting lobar involvement, either in a mixed pattern (n = 8) or a strictly lobar distribution (n = 7). The lobar CMB + had significantly higher plasma lyso-Gb3 levels (6.37 [4.58-18.20] vs. 3.4 [2.25-5.05] ng/mL, p = 0.021), greater left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWd; 14.4 ± 2.4 vs. 11.8 ± 2.7 mm, p = 0.019), and a higher prevalence of dipstick proteinuria (73 % vs. 18 %, p = 0.015). After adjustment for variables, LVPWd remained independently associated with lobar CMBs (odds ratio: 1.83, 95 % CI: 1.01-3.34). Lobar-predominant CMBs were common in our FD cohort and were associated with cardiomyopathy but not with cerebral small vessel disease imaging markers. Further research is needed to explore the causal relationship."

    "title": "Cryptogenic stroke: too many suspects to find a culprit?",
    "abstract": "A cerebral stroke is a heterogeneous entity and-in the context of this heterogeneity-a cryptogenic stroke, that is, of unknown origin at the time of diagnosis, finds a worthy position. Cryptogenic strokes are ∼25% of ischaemic strokes and in hindsight, they often appear to be of obvious or highly presumptive origin. Knowledge of the causes of a cerebral stroke that are not immediately evident is, therefore, fundamental for the purposes of correct secondary and, hopefully, primary prevention. Certainly, in fact, a cryptogenic stroke may require appropriate treatment, which is similar to a stroke whose origin is immediately evident. Equally certainly, however, cryptogenic stroke can benefit from specific treatments, which the lack of diagnosis of origin is destined to nullify. Therefore, it must unfortunately be accepted that a minority of cryptogenic strokes remain without a culprit and, therefore, without a specific corrective treatment. However, the insistent deepening of the diagnostic process in 'obscure' cases must also be pursued. Only the unyielding examination of these cases, in fact, is destined to identify a covert vasculitis, Fabry disease, occult atrial fibrillation, or one of the many pathologies, often far from rare, which require a therapy as specific as it is life-saving. In this brief review, therefore, we will try to fully expand on the identifiable causes of cryptogenic stroke."

    "title": "Applying artificial intelligence to rare diseases: a literature review highlighting lessons from Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Use of artificial intelligence (AI) in rare diseases has grown rapidly in recent years. In this review we have outlined the most common machine-learning and deep-learning methods currently being used to classify and analyse large amounts of data, such as standardized images or specific text in electronic health records. To illustrate how these methods have been adapted or developed for use with rare diseases, we have focused on Fabry disease, an X-linked genetic disorder caused by lysosomal α-galactosidase. A deficiency that can result in multiple organ damage. We searched PubMed for articles focusing on AI, rare diseases, and Fabry disease published anytime up to 08 January 2025. Further searches, limited to articles published between 01 January 2021 and 31 December 2023, were also performed using double combinations of keywords related to AI and each organ affected in Fabry disease, and AI and rare diseases. In total, 20 articles on AI and Fabry disease were included. In the rare disease field, AI methods may be applied prospectively to large populations to identify specific patients, or retrospectively to large data sets to diagnose a previously overlooked rare disease. Different AI methods may facilitate Fabry disease diagnosis, help monitor progression in affected organs, and potentially contribute to personalized therapy development. The implementation of AI methods in general healthcare and medical imaging centres may help raise awareness of rare diseases and prompt general practitioners to consider these conditions earlier in the diagnostic pathway, while chatbots and telemedicine may accelerate patient referral to rare disease experts. The use of AI technologies in healthcare may generate specific ethical risks, prompting new AI regulatory frameworks aimed at addressing these issues to be established in Europe and the United States. AI-based methods will lead to substantial improvements in the diagnosis and management of rare diseases. The need for a human guarantee of AI is a key issue in pursuing innovation while ensuring that human involvement remains at the centre of patient care during this technological revolution."

    "title": "Sphingolipidoses: expanding the spectrum of α-synucleinopathies.",
    "abstract": "Although α-synuclein pathology is typically associated with Lewy body diseases and multiple systems atrophy, increasing evidence indicates that it also occurs in a group of lysosomal storage disorders termed sphingolipidoses caused by the incomplete degradation, and subsequent accumulation, of a class of lipids termed sphingolipids. Notably, a number of genes that cause sphingolipidoses are also risk genes for Lewy body diseases, suggesting aetiological links between these distinct disorders. In the present review, we discuss the sphingolipidoses in which α-synuclein pathology has been reported: Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease and Anderson-Fabry disease, and describe the characteristic clinical and pathological features of these disorders, in addition to the evidence suggesting α-synuclein pathology occurs in these disorders. Finally, we evaluate the pathological mechanisms that underlie these rare disorders, with particular attention to how the enzymatic deficiency, substrate accumulation, or both, could contribute to the genesis of α-synuclein pathology and the implications of this for Lewy body diseases."

    "title": "Concomitant Pathologies and Their Impact on Parkinson Disease: A Narrative Overview of Current Evidence.",
    "abstract": "Many clinico-pathological studies point to the presence of multiple comorbidities/co-pathologies in the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Lewy body pathology, the morphological hallmark of PD, rarely exists in isolation, but is usually associated with other concomitant pathologies, in particular Alzheimer disease-related changes (ADNC), cerebrovascular pathologies (macro- and microinfarcts, cerebral small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy), TDP-43 pathology as well as multiple pathological combinations. These include cardiovascular disorders, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune and rheumatic diseases, myasthenia gravis, Sjögren's syndrome, restless leg syndrome or other rare disorders, like Fabry disease. A combination of PD and multiple sclerosis (MS) may be due to the immune function of LRRK2 and its interrelation with α-synuclein. COVID-19 and HIV posed considerable impacts on patients with PD. Epidemiological evidence points to a decreased risk for the majority of neoplasms, except melanoma and other skin cancers, while some tumors (breast, brain) are increased. On the other hand, a lower frequency of malignancies preceding early PD markers may argue for their protective effect on PD risk. Possible pathogenetic factors for the association between PD and cancer are discussed. The tremendous heterogeneity of concomitant pathologies and comorbidities observed across the PD spectrum is most likely caused by the complex interplay between genetic, pathogenic and other risk factors, and further research should provide increasing insight into their relationship with idiopathic PD (and other parkinsonian disorders) in order to find better diagnostic tools and probable disease-modifying therapies."

    "title": "Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Guidance for the Pathogenetic Definition of Cardiomyopathies.",
    "abstract": "Pathogenetics is the study of genetics in disease pathogenesis. Many abnormal gene alleles have been identified in cardiomyopathies, but their clinical utility remains limited. This review aims to examine the integration of cardiac MRI (CMR) with genetic data to enhance early detection, prognostication, and treatment strategies for cardiomyopathies. CMR is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiomyopathy evaluation, capable of detecting subtle structural and functional changes throughout the disease course. When applied to patients with genetic mutations, with or without phenotypic expression, CMR aids in early diagnosis and risk stratification. Cardiomyopathies can be categorized into at least seven clinical groups based on morphology, function, and genetic associations: (1) Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), (2) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), (3) Restrictive cardiomyopathy, including transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), iron overload, and Anderson-Fabry disease, (4) Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), (5) Non-dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy (NDLVC), (6) Peripartum cardiomyopathy, and (7) Muscular dystrophy-related cardiomyopathy. We have described left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) as a morphological trait rather than a distinct cardiomyopathy. Emerging CMR and genetic data suggest an inflammatory component in DCM and ACM, with potential therapeutic implications for immunotherapy. Advanced CMR techniques, such as quantitative perfusion, can distinguish cardiomyopathies from ischemic heart disease and detect early microvascular dysfunction, particularly in ATTR-CM and HCM. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parametric mapping (T1 and extracellular volume [ECV]) further enhance early diagnosis, prognostication and treatment response by assessing fibrosis and myocardial composition. The integration of CMR and genetic insights improves our understanding of cardiomyopathy pathogenesis, aiding in early diagnosis and prognostic assessment. Future research should leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze genetic and radiomic CMR features, including perfusion data, to establish a comprehensive pathogenetic framework. This approach could refine disease classification, identify novel therapeutic targets, and advance precision medicine in cardiomyopathy management."

The two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have been approved for marketing and have made significant contributions to preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, mRNA therapy has brought hope to some diseases that do not have specific treatment methods or are difficult to treat, such as the Zika virus and influenza virus infections, as well as the prevention and treatment of tumors. With the rapid development of in vitro transcription (IVT) technology, delivery systems, and adjuvants, mRNA therapy has also been applied to hereditary diseases such as Fabry's disease. This article reviews the recent development of mRNA vaccines for structural modification, treatment and prevention of different diseases; delivery carriers and adjuvants; and routes of administration to promote the clinical application of mRNA therapies."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme α-galactosidase A. This defect leads to the progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids, resulting in kidney, heart, and nervous system damage, which contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis is essential to prevent irreversible damage and optimize treatment strategies. Recent research aims to provide a better understanding of FD pathophysiology to improve management approaches. This study is an international, multicenter, cross-sectional analysis that used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare blood samples from 50 FD patients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The objective was to identify gene expression patterns and investigate secondary cellular pathways affected by lysosomal dysfunction. Among the more than 400 differentially expressed genes detected, 207 were protein-coding genes, most of which were overexpressed in the FD cohort. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted processes related to synaptic function, specifically concerning chemical synaptic transmission and membrane potential regulation. Identified genes included those related to voltage-gated ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, cell adhesion molecules, scaffold proteins, and proteins associated with synaptic vesicles and neurotrophic signaling, all linked to lipid rafts. Notable identified genes included those encoding voltage-gated potassium channel genes (KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNMA1) and ionotropic receptor genes involved in glutamatergic (GRIN2A, GRIN2B) and GABAergic systems (GABRA4, GABRB1, GABRG2, GABRQ). These findings suggest that lysosomal dysfunction contributes to synaptic defects in FD, paving the way for further research into the role of synaptic pathology and lipid rafts in the underlying pathogenesis and clinical outcomes in FD."

    "title": "Unraveling the Hidden Burden of Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Challenges in Children with Fabry Disease: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Fabry Disease (FD) is a multisystem X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that often manifests with nonspecific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation. These symptoms may appear early in childhood, severely impacting quality of life and delaying diagnosis, and may be linked to nutritional challenges. This systematic review aims to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, clinical relevance, and nutritional aspects of GI manifestations in pediatric FD patients to aid in early recognition and improve outcomes. A systematic literature search with meta-analysis adhering to PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception to November 2024 using fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently. Disagreements were resolved by consensus; a third reviewer was consulted, when necessary. Pooled analysis was performed by a random-effects model; heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> method. A quality assessment appraisal of the studies was carried out using the ROBINS-I tool. The review encompassed 18 studies involving 736 pediatric patients. The evaluation of the pooled prevalence of GI symptoms in FD patients was 53% (95% CI 38-68%, I<sup>2</sup> 90%), with abdominal pain being the most frequent (pooled prevalence of 46% (95% CI 33-60%, I<sup>2</sup> 86%)). Symptoms often presented early, with a summarized standardized mean difference between the mean age of symptom onset and the mean age at FD diagnosis of 2.07 years (95% CI of 0.56-3.57, I<sup>2</sup> 42%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Nutritional issues, including reduced food intake and potential malabsorption, were reported in cases with severe GI symptoms, contributing to growth impairments. GI symptoms frequently constitute the earliest clinical manifestation of FD in children. Their nonspecific nature underscores the importance of heightened clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis. Early intervention, including enzyme replacement therapy and tailored nutritional strategies, can alleviate symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent disease progression. Multidisciplinary approaches are essential to optimize patient outcomes and further research into the pathophysiology and management of GI symptoms in FD is warranted."

Although clinical manifestations of FD often appear in childhood, approved treatments for the management of FD in children and adolescents are limited. ASPIRE (NCT03500094) was a phase 3b, two-stage, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of migalastat in adolescents 12 to <18 years, ≥ 45 kg with FD and amenable GLA variants. Long-term outcomes were evaluated in the ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study (NCT04049760). Pharmacokinetic results (a primary objective of ASPIRE) were reported previously. Here, we report safety, efficacy, pharmacodynamic, and patient-reported outcome measures in adolescents treated with migalastat for up to 48 months across ASPIRE and the subsequent OLE. Outcome measures included treatment-emergent adverse events, estimated glomerular filtration rate, left ventricular mass index, plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) levels, the Fabry-specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire (FPHPQ), and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™. Overall, 21 patients (52.4 % female) received at least one dose of migalastat in ASPIRE, 11 of whom were enzyme replacement therapy experienced. Mean age at study entry was 14.7 years. Treatment with migalastat was well tolerated in this adolescent population with no new or unexpected safety findings observed. Renal and cardiac measures remained within the normal range for adolescent patients throughout ASPIRE and the OLE with no meaningful changes observed with migalastat treatment. Plasma lyso-Gb3 levels were stable. Pain related to heat or exertion (as measured by FPHPQ) improved with migalastat treatment, and other patient-reported measures of pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life remained stable. These data show a benefit of long-term migalastat treatment in this adolescent patient population with amenable GLA variants."

The aim was to propose the concept of FUO-NIL and explore its differential diagnosis. The present study is a scoping review of FUO-NIL, defined as FUO with normal serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant information. A study was considered eligible for enrolment if the final diagnosis was definitive and the CRP value was clearly noted as normal in each case. The data extracted included the patients' clinical information, final diagnosis, diagnostic tests performed, treatments, and outcomes. The full text of 342 of 3,084 articles were reviewed, and 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. The review identified 19 cases that were eligible for quantitative analysis. The disease categories were infection (n=10, 52.6 %), malignancy (n=3, 15.8 %), non-infectious, inflammatory disease (n=4, 21.1 %), and miscellaneous (n=2, 10.5 %). A more specific differential diagnosis included intracellular fungal infection, tuberculosis, malignancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatous diseases, Fabry disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and functional hyperthermia. FUO-NIL may have a unique differential diagnosis and have a different etiology from that of inflammatory FUO. In addition to the standard diagnostic work-up for FUO, tailored diagnostic strategies, including checking for a history of animal contact, the presence of hypohidrosis, and psychosocial stressors may be warranted in cases of FUO-NIL."

We aimed to investigate the health burden of 20 RNDs in Guangdong Province (GD), which contains two-thirds of the population of South China. The hospitalization data of 20 RNDs were described using hospital-based front sheet data from 3,037 hospitals of GD from 2016 to 2022. The 20 RNDs included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, congenital myotonia, congenital myasthenic syndrome, Dravet syndrome, Fabry disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Huntington disease, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalopathy (ME), multi-focal motor neuropathy, myotonic dystrophy, primary hereditary dystonia, progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinocerebellar ataxia, Wilson disease (WD) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Age were presented as mean and standard deviation while length of hospital stay as median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles). The other variables were described as number and percentage. The data were analyzed by Joinpoint regression. There were 9,351 cases, including 330 ICU and 155 death cases. The average age was 33.7 ± 22.0 y, and 63.8% of patients were male.

Conflicting or discordant results of interpretation of multiple variants in GLA were reported in literature. The aim of this article is to report the spectrum of GLA variants in Argentine population, as well as the revised interpretation of variants classification. Moreover, we intend to find a possible correlation between biochemical parameters, clinical manifestations and genetic variants of adult male Fabry patients that could be of help for interpretation of variants. Blood samples from patients with clinical suspicion of Fabry disease were evaluated for specific laboratory tests: alfa-galactosidase A enzyme activity, LysoGb3 and GLA genetic test. There are 44 males with pathogenic GLA variants which showed deficient enzyme activity. Among them, thirty-two presented the classic phenotype (72%) and twelve the late onset clinical features (28%). Mean percentage of enzyme activity was 0.9% for classical patients and 3.2% for later onset ones. LysoGb3 values were increased in all males, with classic patients showing considerable higher values than that of late onset. Our results showed that the combined analysis of the clinical picture, leukocyte enzyme activity, globotriaosylsphingosine concentration and a detailed exhaustive study of the genetic variant lead to a definite diagnosis in those cases previously interpreted as of unknown significance, together with a revised interpretation of the phenotype."

It is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene that encodes the enzyme α-galactosidase A, GLA. The classic form of the disease begins in childhood, presenting with a range of signs and symptoms that can lead to severe complications such as stroke, as well as cardiac and renal failure. In the late-onset form, the disease appears in adulthood, often with signs of cardiac involvement. The N215S (p.Asn215Ser) missense mutation represents the most common late-onset variant in European countries. In these patients, cardiac involvement is usually more prominent than extracardiac signs and symptoms, which is why this form is often referred to as a cardiac variant. Renal involvement in the N215S variant has historically been considered infrequent and relatively mild, contributing little to the overall disease burden of late-onset FD, as it has not been thoroughly investigated. In this review, we examine Fabry nephropathy in patients with the late-onset N215S variant, providing an insight into the clinical and histopathologic aspects of renal involvement in these individuals."

Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction of the cerebral vasculature and AD neuropathology interact in multiple ways. Additionally, common variants in COL4A1 and rare variants in HTRA1, NOTCH3, COL4A1, and CST3 have been associated with AD pathogenesis. We aimed to search for rare genetic variants in genes associated with monogenic small vessel disease in a cohort of Portuguese early-onset AD patients. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 104 thoroughly studied patients with early-onset AD who lacked known pathogenic variants in the genes associated with AD or frontotemporal dementia. We searched for rare (minor allele frequency < 0.001) non-synonymous variants in genes associated with small vessel disease: NOTCH3, HTRA1, COL4A1, COL4A2, CSTA, GLA, and TREX1. We identified 12 rare variants in 18 patients (17.3% of the cohort). Three male AD patients carried a pathogenic GLA variant (p.Arg118Cys). One of these patients had a definite neuropathological study, confirming the diagnosis of AD and showing concomitant Fabry pathology in CA1-CA4 and the subiculum. We also found several rare variants in other genes associated with cSVD (NOTCH3, COL4A2 and HTRA1), corroborating previous studies and providing further support for the possibility that cSVD genes may play a role in AD pathogenesis. The presence of the same GLA variant in 3 early-onset AD patients, with no other genetic cause for the disease, together with the colocalization of Fabry disease pathology in areas relevant for AD pathogenesis, suggest GLA may have a role in its pathophysiology, possibly parallel to that of GBA in Parkinson's disease, meriting further studies."

    "abstract": "The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains all primary sensory neurons, but its functional role in somatosensory and pain processing remains unclear. Recently, MR imaging techniques have been developed for objective in vivo observation of the DRG. In particular, DRG MR imaging endpoints such as DRG volume and DRG T2w signal are emerging as biomarkers with initial evidence of meaningful correlations with biochemical and genetic parameters as well as neuropathic pain as clinically relevant applications. However, the future validation and use of these novel imaging biomarkers critically depends on the development of fully automated methods for DRG image analysis. To date, DRG detection and evaluation on MR images has been limited to expert annotation through manual segmentation. Fast and operator-independent, yet accurate and robust, segmentation methods are required to enable observation of larger patient cohorts and across multiple sites. Thus, fully automated DRG segmentation is a prerequisite for the analysis of more complex microstructural and functional image datasets, such as from DRG diffusion tensor or perfusion metabolic imaging. Here, we developed a fully automated DRG segmentation workflow based on deep learning. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using the nnU-Net framework on a large dataset of high-resolution 3D T2-weighted MR images of healthy controls (220 DRGs). Automated DRG segmentations generated with this network were on par with expert annotations (dice similarity coefficient of 0.87 for human expert vs. 0.89 for trained CNN) while being faster by a factor of 10. Finally, we validated the method in Fabry disease as a genetic model disorder for DRG pathomorphological injury. The trained CNN was able to reproduce the manually segmented changes known in FD patients as a function of FD genotype and FD pain phenotype. We developed a fully automated method for DRG MRI segmentation and validated its application as a novel imaging biomarker using the DRG injury example of Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess retinal microvascular parameters (RMPs) in Fabry disease (FD) using deep learning, and analyze the correlation with brain lesions related to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). In this retrospective case control study, fundus images from 27 FD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were collected. RMPs, encompassing diameter, density, symmetry, bifurcation, and tortuosity, were quantified. Laboratory examination results, Mainz severity score index (MSSI) scores, and a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan for CSVD scores were extracted and their relationships with RMPs was analyzed. Utilizing artificial intelligence-assisted analysis, compared with controls, FD patients exhibited reduced diameter (p = 0.001 for central retinal artery equivalent, p = 0.049 for central retinal vein equivalent), density (p < 0.001 for vessel area density, p = 0.001 for length density), fractal dimension (p < 0.001), and heightened arteriolar and venular asymmetry ratios (p = 0.002 and p = 0.037, respectively), venular curvature tortuosity (p = 0.037), and simple tortuosity (p = 0.037) in retinal microvascular networks. Gender-based differences in RMPs were observed among FD patients. Furthermore, RMPs were significantly associated with disease markers such as plasma globotriaosylsphingosine and α-galactosidase A activity, as well as MSSI scores. Notably, there was a significant negative correlation between the arteriolar asymmetry ratio and CSVD-related scores (age-related white matter changes: r = - 0.683, p = 0.001; Fazekas: r = - 0.673, p = 0.001; Lacuna: r = - 0.453, p = 0.045; small vessel diseases: r = - 0.721, p = 0.012; global cortical atrophy: r = - 0.582, p = 0.009). Fabry disease patients demonstrated increased vascular tortuosity and asymmetry, reduced density and diameter, and a simpler fractal dimension in retinal microvasculature. These microvascular characteristics may serve as preliminary indicators for assessing brain lesions and could represent potential novel biomarkers for CSVD, aiding in the monitoring of FD severity and progression."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder in which α-galactosidase (GLA) deficiency leads to a build-up of globo-triaosylceramide (Gb3) in various cell types. Gb3 accumulation leads to the abnormalities of microvascular function associated with FD. Previously, we discovered significant abnormalities in vascular endothelial cells (VECs) derived from FD-induced pluripotent stem cells. We then used a cell-based system to screen a group of clinical compounds for candidates capable of rescuing those abnormalities. Lomerizine was one of the most promising candidates because it alleviated a variety of FD-associated phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Lomerizine reduced mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, ROS generation, and the maximal respiration of FD-VECs in vitro. This led to a suppression of the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and rescued FD-VEC function. Furthermore, FD-model mice (Gla-/-/TSP1Tg) treated orally with lomerizine for 6 months showed clear improvement of several FD phenotypes, including left ventricular hypertrophy, renal fibrosis, anhidrosis, and heat intolerance. Thus, our results suggest lomerizine as a novel candidate for FD therapy."

    "abstract": "Acral and triggerable pain is a hallmark of diseases involving small nerve fiber impairment, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. A key role is attributed to pain-related proteins located within the neuronal plasma membrane of nociceptive neurons. To explore this, we employed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory-like neurons and enriched their surface proteins by biotinylation. Samples from three independent cell differentiations were analyzed via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Detected proteins were categorized by cellular location and function, followed by generating an interaction network for deregulated surface proteins. Gene expression of selected proteins was quantified using real-time PCR. A comparative analysis was performed between a patient with Fabry disease (FD) and a healthy control, which we used as model system. We successfully extracted surfaceome proteins from human sensory-like neurons, revealing deregulation of 48 surface proteins in FD-derived neurons. Among the candidates with potential involvement in pain pathophysiology were CACNA2D3, GPM6A, EGFR, and ABCA7. Despite the lack of gene expression differences in these candidates, the interaction network indicated compromised neuronal network integrity. Our approach successfully enabled the extraction and comprehensive analysis of the surfaceome from human sensory-like neurons, establishing a novel methodological framework for investigating human sensory-like neuron biology and cellular disease mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked deficiency in glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by pathogenic variation in <i>GLA</i>. FD can mimic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we present a South African patient of European ancestry with HCM where subsequent genetic analysis led to a diagnosis of FD. He was diagnosed with HCM at the age of 53 when he presented with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and a left occipital cerebral infarction. He reported receiving treatment for recurrent pneumothoraxes in his mid-20s and suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) seven years prior to his diagnosis. During follow-up, he developed progressive chronotropic incompetence with AF and symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacing, as well as progressive dyspnea with obstructive lung disease, mild proteinuria with grade 1 chronic kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Genetic research led to the identification of a pathogenic frameshift variant (<i>GLA</i> c.774_775delAC; p.Pro259ArgfsTer5) in the patient and his mother. This is an ultra-rare 2 bp pathogenic deletion in the causative gene for FD. Therefore, a diagnosis of FD was considered in this family and subsequently confirmed by an enzyme activity test. The proband was started on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to preserve kidney function and prevent other organ involvement, although it was not expected to reverse cardiac hypertrophy. This case demonstrates that non-cardiac disease may precede cardiac presentation in FD, emphasizing the importance of a detailed medical history in patients presenting with HCM. Testing for <i>GLA</i> variation should be considered in patients with similar phenotypic presentation, as diagnosis of HCM phenocopies such as FD can have important implications on treatment and management. Timely treatment of FD with ERT is crucial to prevent end-stage organ damage and preserve quality of life."

    "abstract": "In 2015, Illinois added Fabry disease to the newborn screening (NBS) panel, and numerous individuals who have the controversial p.A143T GLA variant were identified. Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago identified 80 individuals with this variant. Of the 80 individuals, 34/80 were identified by NBS, 2/80 were identified by gene panel testing, and 44/80 were identified by cascade testing. These individuals were from 36 families and ranged in age from 7 months to 71 years. Most individuals identified by NBS were male (90.9%) and 35.96% had the p.A143T variant. All newborns with known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in GLA had enzyme leukocyte activities below 20% of the percentage of mean of normal. This threshold could serve as a guideline for determining risk of symptom development for p.A143T and other variants of unknown significance. No person with p.A143T had significant lyso-GL3 elevation in this cohort. These data suggest the variant impacts enzyme levels, but its effect on health outcomes remains unclear. We further characterize clinical and biochemical data on individuals with the p.A143T GLA variant to help provide guidance on its clinical significance."

We prospectively enrolled 60 participants, with 20 patients each in the CA, FD and HV groups. Echocardiogram, blood exams and walking test were achieved.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease and Gaucher disease are rare genetic disorders characterized by defective degradation of glycosphingolipids caused by enzymatic deficiencies in α-galactosidase A and β-glucocerebrosidase, respectively, and often require life-long treatment. Treatment options for these disorders include replacing the deficient enzymes via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease and velaglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease are two ERT options with demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability. ERT infusions administered by a health care provider (HCP) in the clinic/hospital, or at the patient's home are considered HCP-supported infusions. Self-administration of ERT (by patient, partner, relative, or caregiver) is optional in patients who tolerate the HCP-supported infusions at home and have a suitable home environment. This analysis explored the safety profiles of self-administered agalsidase alfa (202 patients) and velaglucerase alfa (30 patients) versus HCP-supported infusions using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) and Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) registries. The frequency of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) adverse events (AEs) recorded in the two registries was lower in patients self-administering (FOS: 4.5%, GOS: 0%) versus patients receiving HCP-supported infusions (FOS: 13.6%, GOS: 1.6%). In the FOS registry, AE rates per 100 patient-years (100PY) of follow-up were similar between the self-administration (7.99) and HCP-supported infusion (6.78) groups. In patients self-administering agalsidase alfa, cardiac disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (19 [9.4%] patients) and serious AEs (12 [5.9%]) and gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported IRRs (3 [1.5%]). In the GOS registry, AE rates per 100PY were similar between self-administration (4.97) and HCP-supported infusion (4.67) groups. In patients self-administering velaglucerase alfa, skin and subcutaneous disorders (4 [13.3%]) and infections and infestations (2 [6.7%]) were the most reported AEs and serious AEs, respectively, and no IRRs were reported. These findings suggest that self-administration of agalsidase alfa or velaglucerase alfa infusions are not associated with additional safety risks compared with HCP-supported infusions and are a suitable option for qualifying patients. Further research is warranted to support these findings and to explore further the long-term safety and efficacy of ERT self-administration. FOS trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03289065.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-GalA), leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and multi-organ dysfunction, particularly affecting the cardiovascular and renal systems. Disease-modifying treatments such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and oral chaperone therapy (OCT) have limited efficacy, particularly in advanced disease, prompting a need for innovative therapeutic approaches targeting underlying molecular mechanisms beyond glycosphingolipid storage alone. Recent insights into the pathophysiology of FD highlights chronic inflammation and mitochondrial, lysosomal, and endothelial dysfunction as key mediators of disease progression. Adjunctive therapies such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) demonstrate significant cardiovascular and renal benefits in conditions including heart failure and chronic kidney disease. These drugs also modulate pathways involved in the pathophysiology of FD, such as autophagy, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. While theoretical foundations support their utility, dedicated trials are necessary to confirm efficacy in the FD-specific population. This narrative review highlights the importance of expanding therapeutic strategies in FD, advocating for a multi-faceted approach involving evidence-based adjunctive treatments to improve outcomes. Tailored research focusing on diverse FD phenotypes, including females and non-classical variants of disease, will be critical to advancing care and improving outcomes in this complex disorder."

The dorsal root ganglia (DRG) play a key role in Fabry-related neuropathy, but non-invasive biomarkers of DRG involvement and their association with overall disease severity remain limited. This study evaluated lumbosacral DRG T2 relaxation time (DRG-T2) in FD patients as a potential imaging biomarker of FD severity. <b>Methods</b>: In a prospective, single-centre study, 80 genetically confirmed FD patients underwent 3T MRI with quantitative T2 mapping of the lumbosacral DRG. DRG-T2 was analysed in relation to sex, genetic subtype and Fabry-specific biomarkers. <b>Results</b>: Results showed that DRG-T2 was higher in patients with classical FD mutations than in those with nonclassical mutations (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Furthermore, DRG-T2 showed a negative correlation with body weight (ρ = -0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and BMI (ρ = -0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.004), while no associations were found with lyso-Gb3 levels or alpha-galactosidase A activity. The inter-rater and test-retest reliability of DRG-T2 were good to excellent (ICC = 0.76 and 0.89, respectively). <b>Conclusions</b>: These results demonstrate DRG-T2 as a marker of neuronal involvement, making it a strong and reliable imaging biomarker of disease severity in FD.

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder caused by lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids due to the deficiency of α-Galactosidase (α-GAL), which leads to pathology in multiple organ systems. The standard of care is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant native α-GAL protein. Shortcomings of the native α-GAL include low stability, a short circulating half-life, and inadequate uptake by affected tissues that limits the efficacy of ERT and could potentially reduce AAV gene therapy (GT) benefits. Cross-correction by secreted α-GAL is essential for liver-targeted as well as ubiquitous AAV GT due to poor transduction and/or short half-life of some of the significantly affected cell types. <b>Methods</b>: To overcome potential limitations of AAV GT delivering native α-GAL, we used an engineered <i>GLA</i> transgene product to improve enzyme stability and reduce predicted immunogenicity. <b>Results</b>: The stabilized α-GAL variant, Eng-C, had an extended circulatory half-life, allowing for enhanced distribution and efficient uptake by target organs. AAV gene therapy with Eng-C demonstrated significantly greater substrate reduction in the severe Fabry G3Stg/<i>Gla</i>KO mouse model across all affected tissues. Efficacy of the Eng-C AVV GT was equal to or greater than the efficacy of the higher doses of the AAV GT with native α-GAL. Furthermore, this study is the first to demonstrate that the pre-existing pathology in some tissues in G3Stg/<i>Gla</i>KO mice can be reversed with efficient treatment. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our findings demonstrate that an AAV-based gene therapy expressing an engineered α-GAL with improved stability and lower immunogenicity could be effective at lower doses than other AAV GTs, potentially offering lower safety risks typically associated with high AAV vector doses."

A survey was conducted at nine Italian FD centers to evaluate routine management of females with FD; results were discussed at a meeting of eleven Italian specialists and recommendations developed. Of the 227 females managed by the physicians surveyed, 85% were diagnosed through family screening and 38.5% were symptomatic at presentation. Female patients usually underwent cardiac, renal, and neurologic monitoring, and measurement of plasma lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine (Gb3) levels at 6- or 12-month intervals. Treatment was initiated in 54%, mostly enzyme replacement therapy. Experts recommended screening all female relatives of index cases and evaluating all potentially affected organ systems. Diagnosis should be based on genetic analysis. Individualized monitoring of asymptomatic females must balance the need to detect organ damage while maintaining adherence. Treatment decisions should be based primarily on signs/symptoms of FD, but age, family screening results, <i>GLA</i> mutations, Gb3/lyso-Gb3 accumulation, and organ damage should be considered in asymptomatic females.

A total of 513 enzyme tests, 284 lyso-Gb3 tests, and 994 NGS tests were conducted on 1380 individuals (708 female, 661 male, 11 sex unknown) with clinical suspicion, or family history or abnormal newborn screening (NBS) results who participated in the project from December 2018-April 2023. Among these individuals, 21 % (103 male and 2 sex unknown) had abnormal α-Gal A levels (range 0.054-1.069 μM/h, normal level ≥ 1.10 μM/h), and 70 % (79 female, 115 male and 2 sex unknown) had elevated lyso-Gb3 levels (range 1.12-130.56 ng/mL, normal level ≤ 1.11 ng/mL). A total of 137 different reportable variants have been identified in this cohort including novel variants c.[351T>G;361G>C] (p.I117M;A121P), c.370-558_370-1del, c.548del, and c.1165C>T (p.P389S). All female patients with loss-of-function (LOF) variants and biomarker results were found to have elevated lyso-Gb3 levels. In contrast to those with LOF variants, females with missense GLA variants had various lyso-Gb3 results. Pathogenic (P)/likely pathogenic (LP) missense variants [including c.1087C>T (p.R363C), c.1088G>A (p.R363H), c.593T>C (p.I198T), c.644A>G (p.N215S), c.335G>A (p.R112H), c.337T>C (p.F113L), and c.835C>G (p.Q279E)] were identified in 16 female patients with normal lyso-Gb3 levels. These findings suggest that the use of lyso-Gb3 testing without GLA sequencing may result in missed diagnosis in some female patients with FD missense variants. Different biochemical and DNA variant profiles have been observed between NBS and non-NBS male patients. Among the non-NBS males, both enzyme and biomarker results correlate with age at the time of testing, which appear to be an approximated indicator for age of onset and disease severity. Among all the NBS males with both enzyme and lyso-Gb3 results, abnormal α-Gal A levels were found in all having P/LP variants except for the 11 who had c.427G>A (p.A143T) or c.870G>C (p.M290I), while normal lyso-Gb3 results have been found in many males with various P/LP variants - though it should of course be noted that lyso-Gb3 levels may increase over time. Our observation in NBS male patients may suggest that the enzyme test has a higher sensitivity, while lyso-Gb3 test has a higher specificity, and when combined with DNA test results, can provide a more comprehensive and reliable result. This manuscript presents the largest-to-date, comprehensive, multi-testing Fabry cohort with demographic information and biochemical phenotypes from a single clinical laboratory. The results from this dataset demonstrate that the integration of enzyme, biomarker, and NGS testing can enhance screening/diagnostic efficiency for FD, particularly for female patients."

Nonspecific treatment involves symptomatic management of organ involvement. On the other hand, disease-specific treatment is to regulate the activity of the corresponding enzymes, which is targeted. Among them, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a classical therapy. Several studies have demonstrated the significant ameliorative effect of agalactosidase-α (ALTA-a) on cardiac and renal function in patients with FD. Despite the excellent clinical performance, there are limited pharmacoeconomic studies on ERT for FD worldwide. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of ERT for FD in China from the perspective of the healthcare system. We constructed a five-state Markov model based on the disease characteristics of FD. The modeling period was 1 month. The time horizon was 3 years. The willingness-to-pay threshold was chosen as 1-3 times the gross national product (GDP) <i>per capita</i>. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the base case analysis, and one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. The ICER value is ¥148071.95/QALY, which is between 1-3 times GDP <i>per capita</i>. The sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of ALTA-a had a significant effect on ICER and proved the stability of the results. ERT therapy is a cost-effective program compared to \"No ERT\" therapy."

Motor neuron disease is an uncommon condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. He experienced a positive neurological recovery, enabling the cardiology team to investigate the cause of his arrest. Despite his considerable coexisting health issues and reliance on medical and non-medical interventions, he seemed to enjoy a good quality of life. By working together, the multidisciplinary team, alongside the patient and their family, reached an agreement on the treatment offered. In light of his ongoing medical conditions, the patient underwent a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) implantation to reduce the risk of infection while ensuring he got the relevant protection in the event of further life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. He had a successful recovery, maintaining his quality of life and independence. Here, we describe the challenges involved in ensuring the best interest decision was taken, which required extensive collaboration from various specialties following a cardiac arrest."

    "title": "Phenotypic Evolution in Fabry Disease: Our Experience in Indian Cohort.",
    "abstract": "The current study aimed to explore phenotypic evolution in Fabry disease according to demographics, genotype, specific enzyme activity and pathogenicity scores. We integrated clinical, biochemical, and genomic data of 88 Fabry cases (23 from our cohort, 65 from other published data on Indians) to achieve this objective. The affected cases showed profound impairment in the alpha galactosidase enzyme activity (0.73 ± 1.38% mean normal) while carriers showed 15.64 ± 3.68% mean normal activity. The mutation spectrum is highly heterogeneous with eight different mutations identified in eight different patients in our cohort, while the total data is representative of 68 mutations in Indians. The mean CADD score for these mutations was 20.63 ± 10.38. Highly conserved mutations are associated with renal involvement (<i>p</i> = 0.005), while neuropathic pain is observed even in mutations in less conserved regions (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The age of onset showed a positive association with the percentage of specific enzyme activity (<i>r</i> = 0.375, <i>p</i> < 0.001), renal disease (<i>r</i> = 0.328, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and cardiac problems (<i>r</i> = 0.278, <i>p</i> = 0.026). Consistent with this, we had a very early onset neonatal Fabry with 0% specific enzyme activity harbouring c.613C > G (p.Pro205Ala) mutation in the <i>GLA</i> gene. This emphasizes that many patients with rare genetic diseases can experience delays in diagnosis due to their infrequent occurrence and nonspecific symptoms, which are not easily recognizable. A holistic approach with a combination of WES and biochemical assays will be helpful in arriving at the early and accurate diagnosis through rigorous phenotypic evaluation."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease, a rare X-linked hereditary lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, affecting multiple organs. However, functional validation data on the pathogenicity of novel mutations and research on the effects of migalastat intervention at different mutation sites is lacking. To explore the pathogenicity of novel missense mutations in the GLA gene in Fabry disease and the intervention effect of migalastat on the disease model of novel mutation sites. We retrospectively screened novel mutations from the clinical data of 163 patients with Fabry disease, investigated the pathogenicity of these mutations by clinical data and pedigree analysis, bioinformatics prediction, protein structure modeling prediction, and cell experiment. Additionally, this study further assessed the effects of migalastat intervention on these novel mutation sites combined with the amenable mutation criteria for GLA gene mutations applicable to DGJ proposed by the Good Laboratory Practice Human Embryonic Kidney 293 in vitro cell experiment analysis (GLP HEK assay). Ninety-five different mutation sites were detected, comprising 13 novel mutation sites with nine definite pathogenic mutations (nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations and large fragment deletions) and four missense mutations. The variants c.102T > A, c.130T > G, and c.778G > T showed high pathogenicity (pathogenicity prediction score: 9), suggesting significant spatial conformation changes in the mutated protein, while c.194G > A showed a low pathogenicity (score: 5), indicating a mild impact on protein conformation. Cellular functional experiments revealed significantly reduced GLA gene mRNA, α-Gal A protein expression, and enzyme activity levels in the mutant cells. Migalastat intervention significantly normalized α-Gal A protein expression and enzyme activity, particularly in the variant c.194G > A, meeting amenable mutation criteria for migalastat. This study reports 13 novel mutation sites in the GLA gene for Fabry disease, including nine definite pathogenic mutations and four missense mutations confirmed to be pathogenic in this study, thereby enriching the Fabry disease gene mutation database. Migalastat intervention improved enzyme activity in these mutation models, especially in cases with minor changes in protein structure and function, which are expected to guide clinical treatment."

    "title": "Lysosomal Storage-Independent Fabry Disease Variants with α-Galactosidase A Misprocessing-Induced ER Stress and the Unfolded Protein Response.",
    "abstract": "Clinical findings in Fabry disease have classically been attributed to loss-of-function variants in the GLA gene that result in α-galactosidase A deficiency, intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramides and clinical manifestations. However, over time, increasing number of patients have been identified with GLA variants causing either non-classic Fabry disease or having unclear clinical effects. Searching for additional etiologic and lysosomal storage-independent factors, investigators have recently identified that certain missense GLA variants not only affect enzymatic activity, but also encode for misfolded α-galactosidase A that itself induces chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response. Thus, Fabry disease pathogenesis may be caused by decreased enzymatic activity as well as cellular toxicity from accumulation of the misfolded α-galactosidase A protein, with the contribution of each factor determined by the type of the genetic variant and host factors. Defective proteostasis and misfolding of certain missense α-galactosidase A variants induce chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response that may contribute to intra-familial and inter-familial variation in disease penetrance and clinical expressivity. Pharmacologic modulation of defective proteostasis may have therapeutic implications in Fabry disease."

FD can be characterized by neurological symptoms that can occur in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Cerebrovascular involvement is common in FD and is considered an important cause of cryptogenic strokes. This study aimed to describe the neurological symptoms in patients with FD in general and, specifically, to determine the frequency of association between this disease and cerebrovascular manifestations in our environment. This retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study included all patients in the FD registry of the nephrology and cardiology Departments of our center. A descriptive analysis of demographic, neurological, clinical, and neuroimaging variables was performed, with a particular focus on their association with stroke or other cerebrovascular events prior to diagnosis. A total of 25 patients were included, with 14 (68%) of them being women. The median age of the patients was 52 years (relative intensity of collaboration [RIC] = 24.5). The patients belonged to five families with specific galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) mutations. Neuroimaging was performed in 13 (52%) patients, most of whom did not have neurological symptoms but had normal imaging results. Only 2 (8%) patients had nonspecific white matter hyperintensities. Among the 11 (44%) patients with neurological involvement, the most common symptom was pain in the extremities (32%). Stroke was identified in only one patient (4%), which occurred prior to the diagnosis of FD and was determined to be of cardioembolic etiology. FD is found to be associated with several neurological symptoms. In our study, the most common neurological symptom was limb pain, which had varied characteristics. On the other hand, the incidence of stroke was significantly lower than that expected."

    "title": "Enzyme Replacement and Immunosuppression in Heart Transplant Recipients with Fabry Cardiomyopathy: A 7-Year Case Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Fabry disease (FD) is a rare storage disorder caused by the absence or deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A, which leads to accumulation of glycosphingolipids in tissues, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and multiple-organ dysfunction. There are only a few cases of orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) in patients with FD in the literature. This report shows the manifestation of FD, its course in OHT recipient and outcome of 4-year enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) combined with post-transplant immunosuppression. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old female patient had cardiomegaly revealed by a chest X-ray. Subsequent diagnostics included transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Despite typical therapeutic management, she had progression of heart failure (HF) symptoms. After 6 years, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed myocardial fibrosis. This finding and TTE analysis led to suspicion of storage disease with cardiac involvement. Further biochemical and genetic diagnostics showed low activity of alpha-galactosidase A and detected mutations of the GLA gene. Five years after the first cardiac symptoms, Fabry cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. Due to HF progression, she underwent OHT with subsequent standard immunosuppressive treatment. As soon as ERT was available in Poland, it was included to the treatment. Currently, there is no evidence of cardiac involvement of FD or graft rejection. CONCLUSIONS Severe HF not responding to medical therapy in patients with FD can be successfully treated with cardiac transplantation. The risk of disease recurrence in the graft appears to be low. The anti-inflammatory action of post-transplant immunosuppression may play a role in that phenomenon, but further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis."

A total of 36 patients, equally divided into patients with FD and patients with ESRD (control group), were administered the following tools: the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (MCMI-III) to evaluate personality psychopathology and the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) to assess symptoms of psychopathology. Significantly higher levels of Schizoid, Depressive, and Negativistic personality traits emerged in FD patients. Moreover, statistically significant differences in Anxiety, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Obsessive-Compulsive, Depression, Somatization, and Psychoticism dimensions of the SCL-90-R were found, with higher levels of each dimension in patients with FD than ESRD. The literature, albeit limited, highlights how patients with FD are at higher risk of developing psychological distress and psychopathology than patients presenting other chronic diseases such as ESRD. Using psychological therapies together with standard treatments for FD can promote condition acceptance, reduce emotional burden, and relieve psychopathological symptoms in FD patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease, the second most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids (GSL), mainly globotriaosylceramide (also known as Gb3). This aberrant GSL metabolism subsequently causes cellular dysfunction; however, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown. There is growing evidence that damage to organelles, including lysosomes, mitochondria, and plasma membranes, is associated with substrate accumulation. Current methods for the detection of Gb3 are based on anti-Gb3 antibodies, the specificity and sensitivity of which are problematic for glycan detection. This study presents a robust method using lectins, specifically the B-subunit of Shiga toxin (StxB) from <i>Shigella dysenteriae</i> and LecA from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, as alternatives for Gb3 detection in Fabry fibroblasts by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. StxB and LecA showed superior sensitivity, specificity, and consistency in different cell types compared to all anti-Gb3 antibodies used in this study. In addition, sphingolipid metabolism was analyzed in primary Fabry fibroblasts and α-Gal A knockout podocytes using targeted tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our findings establish lectins as a robust tool for improved diagnostics and research of Fabry disease and provide evidence of SL changes in cultured human cells, filling a knowledge gap."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is characterized by an X sex chromosome gene mutation caused by α-galactosidase A deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in various organs, which induces end-organ lesions. In Fabry disease, enzymes with lost or decreased activity in the body are replaced by exogenous supplementation of normal-function α-galactosidase A. Currently, agalsidase α and agalsidase β are widely used for ERT therapy. However, this therapy has limitations such as high cost, short half-life, and production of neutralizing drug antibodies. The use of Migalastat as chaperone therapy has been approved in many countries, and it plays a therapeutic role by enhancing enzyme activity. However, companion therapy drugs are only suitable for patients with decreased enzyme activity, so the scope of their application is limited. In addition, there are several therapeutic drugs in development, including a new generation of ERT therapies, drugs resistant to neutralizing anti-drug antibody drugs, and substrate reduction therapy drugs. Due to the limitations of existing therapeutic drugs, researchers have begun to explore new therapeutic drugs for Fabry disease, so new pathogenic mechanisms and adjuvant therapeutic drugs have been continuously discovered, and the development of related drugs will contribute to disease control and treatment. This article summarizes the existing and potential drugs for treating Fabry disease to facilitate the selection of suitable and effective drugs for treatment."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal disorder due to alpha-galactosidase-A enzyme deficiency, accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) which lead to proinflammatory effects. Males develop progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) followed by fibrosis; females develop nonconcentric hypertrophy and/or early fibrosis. The inflammatory response to Gb3/lyso-Gb-3 accumulation is one of the suggested pathogenic mechanisms in FD cardiomyopathy when the secretion of inflammatory and transforming growth factors with infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into tissue promotes cardiofibrosis. This study aims to evaluate inflammation-driving cytokines and cardio-hypertrophic remodeling biomarkers contributing to sex-specific HCM progression. Biomarkers were studied in 20 healthy subjects and 45 FD patients. IL-2, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were elevated in all patients, while IL-1α, MCP-1, and TNFR2 showed sex-specific differences. The increased cytokines were associated with the NF-kB pathway in FD males with HCM, revealing a correlation between MCP-1, IFN-γ, VEGF, GM-CSF, IL-10, and IL-2. In female patients, the impaired TNFα/TNFR2/TGFβ cluster with correlations to MCP-1, VEGF, GM-CSF, and IL-1α was observed. The activation of cytokines and the NF-kB pathway indicates significant inflammation during HCM remodeling in FD males. The TNFα/TNFR2/TGFβ signaling cluster may explain early fibrosis in females with FD cardiomyopathy. Sex-specific inflammatory responses in FD influence the severity and progression of HCM."

    "abstract": "Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) often maintain preserved left ventricular ejection fraction in the early stages of the disease. There is a need to identify simple and reliable variables beyond left ventricular ejection fraction to recognize those at risk of developing adverse clinical outcomes. To examine left atrial (LA) strain in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and Fabry disease (FD), pathologies known to cause LVH, and the relationship between LA strain and adverse clinical outcomes. In this retrospective cohort study, LA strain was measured and compared among patients with HCM, CA and FD. Relationships between LA and left ventricular strain, and LA strain and adverse cardiovascular events were evaluated. The primary outcome was first occurrence of cardiovascular mortality, device implantation, heart failure hospitalization, new-onset atrial fibrillation or stroke. A total of 191 patients were included (24 with FD, 87 with HCM, 80 with CA). LA reservoir strain was highest in patients with HCM (26%, interquartile range [IQR] 20%, 32%), followed by those with FD (20.5%, IQR: 14%, 27.8%) and CA (11%, IQR: 7%, 18.8%) (P<0.001). LA strain correlated well with left ventricular strain in patients with LVH, with CA showing the best correlation (r=-0.70, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: -0.80 to -0.56; P<0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that LA reservoir strain was significantly associated with the primary outcome in all patients (hazard ratio: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.99; P=0.03) and in those with CA (hazard ratio: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.99; P=0.023). LA strain was more reduced in CA than in FD and HCM, probably as a result of atrial wall infiltration, and was associated with adverse clinical outcomes in our heterogenous LVH population and patients with CA."

    "abstract": "Two-thirds of patients with Fabry disease suffer debilitating pain attacks triggered by exercise, fever, and exposure to environmental heat. These patients face an even greater risk of heat-related episodic pain in the face of global climate change. Almost nothing is known about the biological mechanisms underlying heat-induced pain crises in Fabry disease, and there is no preclinical model available to study Fabry crises. Here, we established the first model of heat-induced pain attacks in Fabry disease by exposing transgenic Fabry rats to environmental heat. Heat exposure precipitated robust mechanical hypersensitivity, closely matching temporal features reported by patients with Fabry disease. At the cellular level, heat exposure sensitized Fabry dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons to agonists for transient receptor potential cation channel A1 (TRPA1), but not TRPV1. The heat shock response, which normally confers heat-resilience, was impaired in Fabry disease, and we demonstrated that heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90) regulate TRPA1. Strikingly, pharmacologically inhibiting HSP90 completely prevented cellular and behavioral sensitization by environmental heat in Fabry disease. Together, this work establishes the first model of episodic pain in Fabry disease, implicates the heat shock response in heat-evoked pain episodes, and identifies a novel heat shock protein-TRPA1 regulatory axis."

In this study we investigated whether early-stage globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation, occurring before the formation of inclusion bodies, could cause significant stress and potentially irreversible damage of the cardiac tissue in patients with FD. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting were performed on fibroblasts from FD IVS4 patients and myocardial biopsies from G3Stg/GLAko mice as well as 3 IVS4 patients (aged 44, 37, and 41 years). Notably, all biopsies showed detectable Gb3 accumulation under immunoflourescence (IF) but lacked the typical pathology of FD (Gb3 inclusion bodies). Staining targeted nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), interleukin-18 (IL-18), phospho-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. In addition, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) IF staining was conducted to identify myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts from FD patients, along with cardiac tissues from both G3Stg/GLAko mice and FD patients, exhibited significant accumulation of inflammatory markers such as NF-κB IL-18, and phospho-p42/44 MAPK, as well as the oxidative stress marker iNOS. Despite the absence of typical FD pathology, the presence of fibrogenesis was confirmed in myocardial biopsies from these patients through strong positive staining of α-SMA. Significant cellular stress and potential irreversible damage may occur before the onset of typical pathologic changes in the cardiac tissues of FD patients. Our findings raise an intriguing question: Should enzyme replacement therapy be initiated much earlier than currently recommended? To answer this, validation through rigorous randomized controlled trials is needed to draw definitive conclusions."

Using Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase, a total of 968 studies were retrieved by January 1, 2024. All clinical studies describing the skin characteristics and abnormalities of FD patients were included. After inclusion of articles, the methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 critical appraisal checklist. Twenty-three studies were included. Different skin manifestations were described in FD patients. Fifteen studies described angiokeratomas, five studied telangiectasias, 13 studied sweat abnormalities (anhidrosis/hypohidrosis/hyperhidrosis), nine described lymphoedema, and two reported hair abnormalities. Sweat abnormalities were the most common skin manifestation, affecting 57.6% of patients with FD; angiokeratomas were observed in 51.5% of patients. A high prevalence (16.5%) of lymphoedema was seen in a large study (n = 5487). Skin involvement appeared age-dependent and increased with age. Quality assessment showed high or unclear risk of bias in 19/23 studies. We summarized data on skin manifestations in 10 757 FD patients. The pathogenesis of sweat abnormalities and the occurrence of cutaneous vascular lesions, such as angiokeratomas and telangiectasias, in only half of FD patients remains poorly understood. Enzyme replacement therapy generally did not reduce skin manifestations in FD patients. Direct comparisons between studies were challenging due to variations in reported outcomes."

We aimed to investigate RA structural and functional remodeling in patients with FD vs. healthy controls using 2D speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) and to explore whether any differences exist in FD patients with and without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We prospectively enrolled patients with FD and controls matched for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with FD were divided in two groups according to the presence/absence of LVH (LVH+: left ventricular wall thickness >12 mm). All patients underwent standard echocardiography and STE analysis investigating the mechanics of all cardiac chambers, including RA reservoir, contractile and conduit strain. A total of 64 patients with FD (50% males; mean age 50 ± 17 years; 51.5% LVH+) and 64 control patients were included in the study. Focusing on right chambers, RA and right ventricular (RV) dimensions were similar between FD and controls. No differences were found for tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (<i>p</i> = 0.073) and RV fractional area change (<i>p</i> = 0.461), while RV systolic Tissue Doppler velocity was reduced in patients with FD (<i>p</i> = 0.041). STE analysis revealed impaired strain values for all cardiac chambers in FD vs controls, specifically: left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS, <i>p</i> < 0.001), left atrial (LA) reservoir strain (<i>p</i> = 0.001), conduit strain (<i>p</i> = 0.012), and contractile strain (<i>p</i> < 0.001), RV-GLS and RV free wall strain (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Similarly, all RA strain phases were significantly reduced in patients with FD compared with control patients (RA reservoir 27.4 ± 11.1 vs. 41.9 ± 8.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001; RA contractile 9.9 ± 5.1 vs. 18.0 ± 4.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.001; RA conduit 19.1 ± 8.1 vs. 24.1 ± 8.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). When comparing FD patients without LVH to controls, it was found that RA reservoir and contractile strains were significantly reduced in the former (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In multivariable linear regression analyses, LA reservoir strain (<i>p</i> = 0.010) and LV-GLS (<i>p</i> = 0.044) emerged as independent correlates of RA mechanics after adjustments were made for RA dimensions, RV systolic function parameters and hypertrophy, and LV maximal wall thickness. In FD impaired RA strain is a common finding. RA reservoir and contractile strains are reduced in FD patients even before LVH ensues, as compared to controls. LA reservoir strain and LV-GLS show an independent correlation with RA reservoir strain."

    "title": "When Proteins Go Berserk: The Unfolded Protein Response and ER Stress.",
    "abstract": "The cellular proteostasis machinery is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by employing quality control systems that identify, sequester, and eliminate damaged or misfolded proteins. However, the accumulation of misfolded proteins can overwhelm these protective mechanisms, disrupting proteostasis. This phenomenon is a hallmark of numerous pathologies, including a variety of genetic disorders. In the secretory pathway, the buildup of misfolded proteins triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR serves as an adaptive mechanism, aiming to alleviate stress and restore cellular homeostasis. However, if ER stress is prolonged or severe, the UPR may fail to restore balance and apoptosis is induced. This review introduces the intricate signaling pathways activated by the three UPR transmembrane sensors: protein-kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). We briefly present the roles of the distinct transcriptional programs activated by each sensor in modulating the cellular response to protein stress and in determining cell fate. We discuss how genetic variants and environmental factors contribute to the heterogeneity observed in protein misfolding diseases. Finally, we critically evaluate select therapeutic strategies, specifically protein stabilization, trafficking modulation, and UPR sensor targeting approaches. This review introduces the potential consequences of protein misfolding, which may not only impair protein function but can also lead to toxic protein accumulation and stress induction. Using Fabry disease as a compelling example, we suggest that future therapeutic intervention may require nuanced, combination approaches that address both loss and gain of protein function."

    "abstract": "Despite life-long pharmacotherapy for many people affected by lysosomal storage diseases, no data are available on their beliefs about their treatments. Therapeutic options range from disease-specific, with varying levels of effectiveness, to purely supportive. This spectrum is illustrated by the three diseases Gaucher disease type 1 (effective disease-specific therapies), Fabry disease (disease-specific therapies with variable effectiveness), and mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (supportive care only). Employing the Necessity-Concerns Framework of the Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire, we investigated intra- and intergroup variability in adults with Gaucher disease type 1, Fabry disease, and parents of children with mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B. Participants rated <i>necessity</i> and <i>concern</i> items on a Likert scale, leading to categorization as <i>accepting</i>, <i>skeptical</i>, <i>indifferent</i>, or <i>ambivalent</i>. Self-reported demographic, disease-, and therapy-related data were also obtained. Eighty-one surveys were completed. Gaucher disease respondents (<i>n</i> = 15) were overwhelmingly categorized as <i>accepting</i> (high necessity, low concern). Female Fabry disease respondents (<i>n</i> = 43) were almost equally distributed over all categories except <i>accepting.</i> Male Fabry disease respondents (<i>n</i> = 16) were mostly <i>ambivalent</i> or <i>accepting</i>, indicating overall high necessity scores but varying concern. All mucopolysaccharidosis type III participants (<i>n</i> = 7) were categorized as <i>indifferent</i> (low necessity, low concern). The Beliefs in Medicine Questionnaire emerged as a valuable and feasibly employable tool for individual and group assessments in these populations. It reveals differences in beliefs aligned with current unmet medical needs. Expansion of this approach is warranted to optimize personalized counseling on therapeutic choices and to align drug development with the needs and beliefs of potential recipients."

    "title": "Salvageable locoregional recurrence and stoma rate after local excision of pT1-2 rectal cancer - A nationwide cross-sectional cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Screening has increased the incidence of early-stage rectal cancer and interest in rectal-preserving treatment strategies. Although guidelines recommend completion total mesorectal excision (cTME) in the presence of histological risk factor(s) after local excision, surgery-related morbidity often deters patients from cTME. Additionally, locoregional recurrences (LR) identified during surveillance may still be salvageable. This study evaluates oncological and surgical outcomes in pT1-2 rectal cancer patients who received local excision with or without additional therapy. A retrospective cross-sectional national cohort study was conducted in 67 Dutch hospitals, including all patients who underwent curative surgical resection for rectal cancer in 2016. Patients with pT1-2 tumours who received surveillance, cTME or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after local excision were selected. The primary outcome was LR. Secondary endpoints included ostomy rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Of 3057 patients, 219 underwent local excision, followed by surveillance in 74 % (n = 162), cTME in 23 % (n = 51), and adjuvant (chemo)radiation in 3 % (n = 6). Median follow-up was 46 months (IQR 29-54). Four-year LR rates were 14 % and 4 % after surveillance and cTME, respectively (p = 0.033). In the surveillance group, 16 of 20 patients (80 %) who developed LR were treated with curative intent. cTME resulted in a substantially higher ostomy rate (43 % vs 4 %, p = 0.001). No significant differences were found in 4-year DFS and OS. Despite a LR rate of 14 % after local excision alone, the majority of these recurrences could be treated with curative intent. Additionally, the risk of stoma was 10-fold lower after surveillance compared to cTME. ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT05539417, https://www. gov/ct2/show/NCT05539417."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease. Earlier studies have mentioned dizziness/balance issues and vestibular involvement as a symptom of Fabry disease. Research on the matter remains scarce. This pilot study aims to show the prevalence of dizziness/balance issues and whether it is due to peripheral, central, or other factors. <b>Methods</b>: A Dizziness Handicap Inventory, with added questions, was sent out to 91 Fabry patients to estimate the prevalence of dizziness/balance issues. Additionally, this study reports analyses from eight Fabry patients with self-reported dizziness/balance issues who were offered referrals for in-depth investigations of their condition. All eight underwent a comprehensive oto-neurological examination, Videonystagmography, a Video Head impulse test, vestibular myogenic evoked potential, and audiometry. <b>Results</b>: A total of 55 of the 91 patients with Fabry disease answered the survey. Of these, 78.2% felt symptoms of dizziness/balance issues. The most common form of dizziness/balance issues was short-lasting attacks. All eight ENT-examined patients had normal outer and middle ear conditions. Five of eight Fabry patients had abnormal results in the optokinetic test and audiometry. <b>Conclusions</b>: The survey showed a high prevalence of dizziness/balance issues in Fabry patients. The abnormal optokinetic test suggested a central cause and was the only objective measurement we found that could lead to an explanation for dizziness/balance issues. Polypharmacy was present in all eight examined patients and could also explain the dizziness/balance issues in Fabry patients. There is no other clear pattern regarding the characteristics of dizziness/balance issues in Fabry patients in this exploratory study."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Fabry disease (FD) is an inborn error of the glycosphingolipid metabolism with variable kidney, heart, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. CNS-related FD manifestations include early ischemic stroke and white matter lesions (WMLs) related to cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD), possibly resulting in cognitive impairment. We studied 40 adult FD patients (17 male) to assess: (i) prevalence of cerebrovascular and cognitive manifestations in FD and their correlation with heart and renal involvement; and (ii) the potential value of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels as an indicator of WMLs in FD. <b>Methods:</b> Patients underwent detailed diagnostic assessment related to FD, also including Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), neuropsychological tests, brain MRI to assess WMLs by the modified Fazekas score (mFS), and NfL determination by single-molecule array (SiMoA) (<i>n</i> = 22 FD patients vs. 15 healthy controls). <b>Results:</b> Overall, 4 FD patients had a history of ischemic stroke and 13/32 patients (40.6%) had an mFS ≥ 1. Almost two-thirds of FD patients (27/39, 69.2%) showed impairment on at least one cognitive test. On univariate analysis, only a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with an increased likelihood of having WMLs on brain MRI. Serum NfL levels were higher in FD patients vs. controls, with a trend toward significance (<i>p</i> = 0.08). <b>Conclusions:</b> Mild-to-moderate CSVD is a characteristic brain \"signature\" in FD patients. Both cardiac and renal involvement correlate with WML load, but only renal involvement appears to be predictive of CNS damage. Brain microvascular damage is associated with mild cognitive impairment in FD, and serum NfL might represent a potential biomarker of CSVD in FD."

    "abstract": "Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and systemic manifestations such as chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neurological symptoms. Unlike other EDS subtypes with known genetic mutations, hEDS lacks definitive markers, suggesting a multifactorial etiology involving both mitochondrial dysfunction and non-mitochondrial pathways. This scoping review, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, highlights mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential unifying mechanism in hEDS pathophysiology. Impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and calcium dysregulation disrupt cellular energetics and extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis, contributing to the hallmark features of hEDS. We reviewed candidate genes associated with ECM remodeling, signaling pathways, and immune regulation. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed interconnected pathways linking mitochondrial dysfunction with these candidate genes. Comparative insights from Fabry disease and fragile X premutation carriers underscore shared mechanisms such as RNA toxicity, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activation, and ECM degradation. These findings may suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction amplifies systemic manifestations through its interplay with non-mitochondrial molecular pathways. By integrating these perspectives, this review provides a potential framework for understanding hEDS pathogenesis while highlighting latent avenues for future research into its molecular basis. Understanding the potential role of mitochondrial dysfunction in hEDS not only sheds light on its complex molecular etiology but also opens new paths for targeted interventions."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in <i>GLA</i>, which encodes α-galactosidase A (GLA). The loss or reduced activity of GLA leads to damage to multiple organs, resulting in the intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various organs, including the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. Pathological changes in the heart typically result in concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an intractable disease characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and is typically characterized by asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. We performed a causative gene analysis in patients with a rare subtype of HCM, HCM with mid-ventricular obstruction (HCM-MVO), and identified four patients with different pathogenic variants of <i>GLA</i>, which were clinically confirmed as FD. All four patients with FD and rare HCM-MVO morphology were female, and all cases involved the classical form of the disease. Three cases in whom lymphocyte Lyso-Gb3 was measured showed a marked decrease in Lyso-Gb3 after initiating enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). However, even after ERT, myocardial involvement worsened in the long term, and two patients experienced fatal arrhythmias. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of myocardial involvement in FD using a lymphocyte-based Lyso-Gb3 assay system. In addition, none of these female patients had renal dysfunction, indicating a different pattern of organ damage compared with that previously reported in male patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) results from pathogenic <i>GLA</i> variants, leading to a deficiency in lysosomal α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) and accumulation of the sphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). This leads to severe renal and cardiovascular complications, primarily affecting kidney podocytes. As a multisystemic disorder, FD initiates at the cellular level; however, the mechanism(s) underlying Gb3-induced cell dysfunction remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify potential drivers of FD and explore the underlying cell pathology in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived podocytes from patients with FD. iPSCs were derived from patients with FD with <i>GLA</i> <sup>c.851T>C</sup> or <i>GLA</i> <sup>c.1193_1196del</sup> variants and compared with controls or CRISPR-Cas9-corrected cell lines. iPSCs were differentiated into podocytes; and α-Gal A activity, Gb3 accumulation, and cell morphology were assessed. Label-free mass spectrometry identified the top, differentially expressed proteins which were validated by using western blot. Podocytes derived from patients with FD exhibited expression of podocyte-specific markers and morphological features of FD. Reduced α-Gal A activity was observed in FD iPSC-derived podocytes along with the accumulation of Gb3. Proteomic profiling revealed distinct proteomic signatures between control and iPSC-derived podocytes from a patient with FD, with apparent variations among FD lines, highlighting <i>GLA</i> variant-specific proteomic alterations. Notably, the ferroptosis-associated protein, arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), was the most upregulated protein in FD podocytes and ferroptosis was the most enriched pathway. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of ALOX15 in FD podocytes, with validation of other markers implicating ferroptosis in FD pathology. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of FD and, for the first time, implicate ferroptosis as a potential common pathway driving its pathology."

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has crucial roles in metabolically active cells, including protein translation, protein folding and quality control, lipid biosynthesis, and calcium homeostasis. Adverse metabolic conditions or pathogenic genetic variants that cause misfolding and accumulation of proteins within the ER of kidney cells initiate an injurious process known as ER stress that contributes to kidney disease and its cardiovascular complications. Initiation of ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular defence mechanism that functions to restore ER homeostasis. However, severe or chronic ER stress rewires the UPR to activate deleterious pathways that exacerbate inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis, resulting in kidney injury. This insidious crosstalk between ER stress, UPR activation, oxidative stress and inflammation forms a vicious cycle that drives kidney disease and vascular damage. Furthermore, genetic variants that disrupt protein-folding mechanisms trigger ER stress, as evidenced in autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease and Fabry disease. Emerging therapeutic strategies that enhance protein-folding capacity and reduce the burden of ER stress have shown promising results in kidney diseases. Thus, integrating knowledge of how genetic variants cause protein misfolding and ER stress into clinical practice will enhance treatment strategies and potentially improve outcomes for various kidney diseases and their vascular complications."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the follow-up of patients with Fabry disease. Our hypothesis was that LV functional parameters and native myocardial T1 and T2 values could be used to monitor treatment efficacy. This prospective, observational, multicenter study included patients with Fabry disease who underwent two cardiac MRI examinations performed at 1.5 T 24 months apart at five University Hospitals between March 2017 and December 2022. Changes in cardiac MRI parameters were compared between two groups of patients according to whether or not they were receiving specific treatment. Twenty-six patients with Fabry disease were enrolled. There were 17 women and 9 men, with a mean age of 45.3 ± 17.4 (standard deviation [SD]) years. Both treated and untreated patients showed an increase in native T1 values over time, but the T1 increase was higher in treated patients (global T1, +39.4 ± 28.9 [SD] ms) than in untreated ones (global T1, +14.5 ± 30.3 [SD] ms) (P = 0.04). T2 values decreased in treated patients (global T2, -2.11 [SD] ms ± 3.36 but increased in untreated ones (global T2, +0.57 ± 1.63 [SD] ms) (P = 0.02). No significant changes in extracellular cardiac volume, left ventricular functional parameters, late gadolinium enhancement or left atrial volume were observed. However, LV mass index increased in untreated patients and decreased in treated patients. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility of T1 measurements showed mean biases of -0.18 ms (limit of agreement:11.61, 11.24) and -0.64 ms (limit of agreement:23.82; 22.54), respectively. Variations in native myocardial T1 values at cardiac MRI are significantly greater in patients with Fabry disease receiving treatment than in untreated patients, suggesting an effect of treatment on lipid storage. In addition, changes in T2 values suggest an anti-inflammatory effect of the treatment."

    "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an immunomodulatory medication used for decades. HCQ is a weak base accumulating in acidic cytoplasmic vesicles, such as lysosomes. This accumulation raises the pH and interferes with the functions of the lysosomal enzymes, including α-galactosidase A, resulting in a unique clinical and pathologic feature. We present a case with severe HCQ-induced cardiomyopathy to show the pattern of cardiac involvement and available imaging and pathologic modalities. The case involves a 76-year-old woman with a history of Sjögren's disease who had been treated with HCQ for 13 years and presented with symptoms of heart failure. An echocardiogram showed thick ventricles with reduced ejection fraction, and cardiac MRI revealed mid-wall, subepicardial, and patchy late gadolinium enhancement with a non-ischemic distribution, lack of edema and perfusion abnormality, left ventricle wall thickening, biventricular hypokinesis, bilateral atrial enlargement, and mild to moderate mitral valve and tricuspid valve regurgitation, which are compatible with HCQ-induced cardiomyopathy. An endomyocardial biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed myocyte vacuolization. The periodic acid-Schiff stain was positive. A decrease in color intensity within the vacuoles was observed when diastase was added. Electron microscopy demonstrated inclusion bodies, described as myeloid and curvilinear bodies, confirming the diagnosis. HCQ-induced cardiomyopathy is a rare, potentially fatal side effect. Given the frequent use of this medication, it is important to consider it while evaluating patients with unexplained deterioration in cardiac function after prolonged use."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of the enzyme α-galactosidase A, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various tissues, including the heart. Cardiac involvement is a prominent feature and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Fabry disease, manifesting as left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischaemia, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Secondary mechanisms, triggered by lysosomal storage, contribute to myocardial damage, in particular, myocardial inflammation. Early cardiac involvement can be subtle, but with disease progression, it becomes a major determinant of morbidity and mortality. Recent progresses in diagnostic techniques, such as advanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with T1 and T2 mapping, have improved early detection of Fabry-related cardiac disease. Enzyme replacement therapy and newer treatments like chaperone therapy have shown potential in managing cardiac manifestations when initiated early, while the progression of cardiac involvement may be difficult to halt in patients diagnosed late in the disease course. Gene therapy and substrate reduction therapy are emerging treatment modalities that hold promise but require further clinical evaluation. The limited efficacy of available therapies and the variability of cardiac response to treatment represent main unresolved issues, together with challenges in monitoring disease progression, and the need for additional therapeutic strategies targeting secondary mechanisms. Unmet needs in clinical practice include the identification of disease-specific and cardiac-specific biomarkers for early detection, staging, and monitoring cardiac damage. Similarly, strategies for prognostic stratification and better prevention of cardiovascular complications are essential to improve the care of these patients."

Data from 3 consecutive visits of 102 female FD patients from 6 Fabry centers were retrospectively analyzed. According to their FD-specific treatment, patients were separated in 5 groups: Newly agalsidase-beta- [n = 18], agalsidase-alfa- [n = 29] and migalastat-[n = 14] treated patients, and long-term agalsidase-beta- [n = 7] and agalsidase-alfa-[n = 34] treated patients. Clinical presentation and laboratory data, including plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> levels were assessed. Treatment with agalsidase-beta, agalsidase-alfa, and migalastat was safe and severe adverse events were rare. Newly and long-term-treated patients presented a stable disease course over time. None of the patients required hospitalization due to cardiac events. Overall septum thickness remained stable in all groups (p > 0.05). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) only slightly decreased in patients treated with agalsidase-alfa [newly- and long-term-treated: -1.5 ± 3.2 and - 1.3 ± 3.9 ml/min/1.73 m²/year; p = 0.0056 and p = 0.0187, respectively] but the decrease was in the range of natural eGFR decline. eGFRs in agalsidase-beta and migalastat-treated patients were stable. No clinically relevant differences concerning treatment efficacy between agalasidase-beta, agalsidase-alfa, and migalastat were detected. We conclude that treatment of females with agalsidase-beta, agalsidase-alfa, and migalastat was safe. Independent of the chosen treatment regimen, nearly all patients presented with a stable disease course over time. In our cohort, a comparison of therapy efficacies showed no relevant clinical differences between the groups."

Data regarding therapeutic regimen and organ involvement (heart, kidney, and brain) of each patient were reviewed. Patients underwent full ophthalmological examination including best-corrected visual acuity, retinography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and FIAOO imaging grading of retinal vessels. The number of inner-retinal HRFs was determined within the central 2500 μm at the foveal level in each patient and correlation with ocular imaging findings and systemic involvement parameters was assessed through Spearman correlation analysis and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with a robust Huber White standard error estimation. Inner retinal HRFs number showed a significant association with male gender, use of enzyme replacement therapy and presence of retinal vessel tortuosity (all p < 0.001). Severity of NHYA class and presence of cornea verticillata reached a quasi-significant association (p = 0.089 and p = 0.07, respectively). Increase of FIAOO grading was associated to increased HRFs number (p < 0.001) and increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate was inversely associated with HRFs number (p = 0.04). Inner retinal HRF number correlated with organ involvement and ocular imaging findings in FD patients.

    "title": "The Inflammatory Pathogenetic Pathways of Fabry Nephropathy and Agalopathy: GLA Variant Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a monogenic disease with highly variable clinical features. This variability suggests that additional pathogenetic pathways may exist besides the intra-lysosomal deposition of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form globotriaosylsphingosine (LysoGb3) caused by an enzyme deficiency. It has been demonstrated that intralysosomal accumulation of Gb3 and LysoGb3 triggers an inflammatory response. Monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells overexpress the adhesion molecules, and cytokines release occurs, including interleukin β, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and transforming growth factor beta. These processes determine the activation of inflammation processes associated with chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis. The pathogenetic mechanisms stimulated by Gb3 and LysoGb3 deposition could break free from the original activation, causing an irreversible effect, in which Fabry disease-specific therapy can play a limited role. A new disease mechanism, \"Agalopathy\" would coexist with enzyme deficiency. Missense variants in the coding sequence of the GLA gene would generate the misfolding of the altered protein alpha-galactosidase A. Emergence of misfolded proteins may generate stress of the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributes to inflammatory status. This mechanism could be activated independently of glycolipid deposition, and its relationship with inflammatory pathways deserves more research. Strikingly, a zebrafish GLA knockout model that naturally lacks the enzyme that synthesizes Gb3 shows many alterations in lysosomal functions. These pieces of evidence suggest the involvement of alternative pathways independent of Gb3 in FD pathogenesis. This review aims to describe these processes' role in the pathogenesis of renal damage in FD or Agalopathy nephropathies."

We compared the differences between the sexes (heterozygous and hemizygous) and phenotypes (classical and non-classical). The epithelial deposit detection rate with IVCM was statistically higher (52/60, 86.67%) compared to the biomicroscopic evaluation of CV using a silt lamp (46/60, 76.67%) (<i>p</i> = 0.031). A higher prevalence of corneal epithelial deposits was observed in the classical phenotype as compared to the non-classical phenotype (<i>p</i> = 0.023). Surprisingly, cardiac variants previously lacking cornea verticillata show a high prevalence (85.71%) of corneal epithelial deposits under IVCM. The prevalence and severity of deposits, especially in limbal epithelial rete pegs, were higher in FD than in controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Compared with slit-lamp microscopy, IVCM provides a more effective tool for examining the epithelial deposits in patients with FD. Patients with FD demonstrated a profound bilateral increase in corneal epithelial deposits and limbal hyperreflective cells compared to controls, with more prominent pathological changes observed in classical phenotype individuals. The high prevalence of epithelial deposits observed through IVCM in the cardiac variant highlights the essential ability of IVCM as an effective diagnostic tool."

Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in Fabry patients; however, a lack of understanding of the pathological mechanism impedes the development of effective therapies. Here, we used a Gla knockout (KO) mouse model and investigated its impact on cardiomyopathy. We found that globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) increased the uptake and accumulation of fatty acids in KO hearts by increasing the expression levels of CD36 and ACC2. The augmented fatty acid metabolism further increased autophagy activity, leading to age-related late-onset cardiac hypertrophy. Additionally, increased autophagy facilitates disturbances in fatty acid metabolism. The inhibition of autophagy by supplementation with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or the overexpression of GLA by the cardiomyocyte-specific adeno-associated virus for 2 months could rebalance abnormal fatty acid metabolism and ameliorate cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in KO hearts, suggesting a central role of autophagy in GLA deficiency-related cardiomyopathy."

This review highlights the diagnostic and prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography in the assessment of cardiomyopathies. While echocardiography remains the first-line imaging modality, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and cardiac computerized tomography (CCT) offer superior tissue characterization, morphological assessment, and functional evaluation, crucial for phenotyping cardiomyopathies into hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic, and non-dilated left ventricular subtypes. For hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, CMR enables precise identification of fibrosis, hypertrophy distribution, and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death. CMR is pivotal in identifying phenocopies, like cardiac amyloidosis and Anderson-Fabry disease, and differentiating between pathological and physiological remodeling in athlete's heart. For dilated cardiomyopathy, late gadolinium enhancement, T1 mapping, and extracellular volume measurements aid in distinguishing etiologies and predicting adverse outcomes. In arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, CMR demonstrates superior sensitivity for detecting structural abnormalities in the right ventricle, and the presence of fibrosis which is associated with arrhythmic risk. CCT main roles are excluding coronary artery disease and complementing CMR. This review proposes a diagnostic pathway integrating multimodality imaging for clinical management in cardiomyopathies."

The diagnostic evaluation for AFD involves clinical assessment and family history, supported by biochemical testing (α-Gal A enzyme activity and Lyso-Gb3 levels) and genetic analysis of the GLA gene. In cases of unexplained renal impairment or when genetic analysis is inconclusive, kidney biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis and guide targeted treatments. However, histological findings in kidney biopsies may sometimes be nonspecific, complicating the diagnostic process.

The second case describes the 36-year-old brother, who was diagnosed through family screening and, despite normal initial cardiac ultrasound findings, exhibited early cardiac involvement through reduced T1-mapping values. Immediate initiation of ERT led to normalization of T1 values and successful renal transplantation. <b>Conclusions</b>: This report underscores the importance of family screening and early diagnosis in FD and highlights the role of CMR in detecting preclinical cardiac involvement."

    "title": "Fabry Disease and Inflammation: Potential Role of p65 iso5, an Isoform of the NF-κB Complex.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease, caused by mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene on the X chromosome, resulting in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-GAL. This leads to the progressive accumulation of Gb3 in cells, causing multi-systemic effects. FD has been classified as a subgroup of autoinflammatory diseases. NF-κB is a family of ubiquitous and inducible transcription factors that play critical roles in inflammation, in which the p65/p50 heterodimer is the most abundant. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) represents the physiological antagonists in the inflammation process. A novel spliced variant of p65, named p65 iso5, which can bind the dexamethasone, enhancing GR activity, has been found. This study investigates the potential role of p65 iso5 in the inflammation of subjects with FD. We evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), from over 100 FD patients, the p65 iso5 mRNA level, and the protein expression. The results showed significantly lower p65 iso5 mRNA and protein expression levels compared to controls. These findings, along with the ability of p65 iso5 to bind dexamethasone and the regulation of the glucocorticoid response in the opposite way of p65, strongly suggest the involvement of p65 iso5 in the inflammatory response in FD."

    "title": "Telomere Length, Oxidative Stress, and Kidney Damage Biomarkers in Fabry Nephropathy.",
    "abstract": "Fabry nephropathy is a life-threatening complication of Fabry disease characterized by complex and incompletely understood pathophysiological processes possibly linked to premature aging. We aimed to investigate leukocyte telomere length (LTL), oxidative stress, and kidney damage biomarkers in relation to kidney function. The study included 35 Fabry patients and 35 age and sex-matched control subjects. Based on the estimated slope of the glomerular filtration rate, the patients were divided into two groups. Relative LTL was quantified by qPCR, urinary biomarkers 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) by UHPLC-MS/MS, and kidney damage biomarkers by flow cytometry. There was no statistically significant difference in LTL between Fabry patients and controls. However, a significant difference was observed in male patients compared to their matched control subjects (<i>p</i> = 0.013). Oxidative stress biomarkers showed no differences between patients and controls, while significant differences were observed in urinary IGFBP7, EGF, and OPN levels between Fabry patients with stable kidney function and those with progressive nephropathy (FDR = 0.021, 0.002, and 0.013, respectively). Significant differences were also observed in plasma levels of cystatin C, TFF3, and uromodulin between patients with progressive nephropathy and controls (all FDR = 0.039). Along with these biomarkers (FDR = 0.007, 0.017, and 0.010, respectively), NGAL also exhibited a significant difference between the two patient groups (FDR = 0.017). This study indicates accelerated telomere attrition, which may be related to disease burden in males. Furthermore, analyses of urinary oxidative stress markers revealed no notable disparities between the different kidney function groups, indicating their limited utility. However, promising differences were found in some biomarkers of kidney damage in urine and plasma."

    "title": "Development of selective nanomolar cyclic peptide ligands as GBA1 enzyme stabilisers.",
    "abstract": "The stabilisation of recombinant glycosidases by exogenous ligands, known as pharmacological chaperones or enzyme stabilisers, has recently garnered great clinical interest. This strategy can prevent enzyme degradation in the blood, reducing required dosages of recombinant enzyme and extending IV injection intervals, thereby reducing side effects, improving patient lifestyles and treatment costs. While this therapeutic approach has been successfully implemented for treating Pompe and Fabry diseases, clinical studies for Gaucher disease using chaperones alone or in combination with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been limited, and no small molecule chaperones have yet been approved for this condition. Developing such therapies requires selective and effective reversible GBA1 ligands. Here, we describe the development of a new class of selective macrocyclic peptide GBA1 ligands using random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) technology, and demonstrate their ability to bind and stabilise rhGBA1 in plasma at nanomolar concentrations. These cyclic peptides do not inhibit endogenous GBA1 in cells due to poor cell permeability but can stabilise extracellular rhGBA1 in plasma, presenting significant potential as a combinatorial ERT-pharmacological chaperone therapy for Gaucher disease."

While infusion-related reactions (IRRs) are known to occur at the initiation of ERT owing to immune responses, there is limited information on IRRs during long-term ERT. We report the case of a female patient with Fabry disease who developed unexpected hypotension after six years of stable treatment with agalsidase α, leading to a switch to agalsidase β. Continuous monitoring may be essential to identify potential IRRs in female patients with Fabry disease receiving long-term ERT."

    "abstract": "The clinical impact of enzyme replacement therapy on advanced Fabry disease cardiomyopathy appears to be limited. The pathologic mechanisms involved are still unclear. Ten male patients with advanced Fabry disease cardiomyopathy on enzyme replacement therapy, whose disease progressed from maximal wall thickness of 15.4±2.2 to 19.3±2.1 mm in 8.6±1.4 years of follow-up, underwent left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy before and 4 hours after β-agalsidase infusion (1 mg/kg). Comparative studies between pre- and postinfusion samples included the following: histology, electron microscopy and assessment of myocardial α-galactosidase A activity; immunohistochemistry for α-galactosidase A and semiquantitative evaluation (from 0 to 3) of its cardiomyocyte content; and ultrastructural immunogold analysis with anti-α-galactosidase A ab; and Western blot quantification of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Controls were surgical biopsies from patients with mitral stenosis. Histologic and ultrastructural evaluation showed myocarditis in 7 of 10 patients, There was no removal of storage material while myocardial fibrosis was 9.8%±6.8% versus 3.8%±2.0% of controls. At ultrastructural immunogold analysis, myocardial α-galactosidase A activity increased in postinfusion samples by overall 1.89-fold. Alpha-galactosidase A immunostaining in cardiomyocytes was absent at baseline in all patients and did not significantly improve in postinfusion samples. Immunogold particles increased by 1.33-fold (17.6±3.6 preinfusion versus 21.5±5.9 postinfusion), remaining far from normal controls (86.9±6.6). Protein analysis showed mannose-6-phosphate receptors to be 81% lower than in a normal heart. In spite of enzyme delivery to cardiac tissue, our study shows a low accessibility to enzyme replacement therapy of cardiomyocytes affected by advanced Fabry disease cardiomyopathy. It is sustained by myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, and severe down-regulation of mannose-6-phosphate receptors."

All physicians who participated in the SSIEM adult metabolic physicians group paper in 2014 were contacted to provide updated data on their IEM patients. Fifteen adult centres responded to our survey with information on their patients. Nine thousand, six hundred fifty-one patients were included in the final cohort, compared with 6 182 in the previous analysis. There were 394 separate diagnoses. The most common diseases were phenylketonuria (19.6%), mitochondrial disorders (12.3%) and lysosomal storage disorders such as Fabry disease (20.1% of LSD's), Pompe disease (3.1%), and Gaucher disease (2.8%). Among the disorders that can present with acute metabolic decompensation, the urea cycle disorders (4.0%), were most common (ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency 2.6%), followed by maple syrup urine disease (1.1%) and glycogen storage disease type I (0.7%). Patients were frequently diagnosed as adults, particularly those with mitochondrial disease and lysosomal storage disorders. Many patients are only diagnosed in adulthood (> 40%) and the cohort is increasing substantially with 9 651 patients included in the final analysis (34% increase compared to our original paper).

    "abstract": "Obesity is a devastating worldwide metabolic disease, with the highest prevalence in children and adolescents. Obesity impacts neuronal function but the fate of functional hyperemia, a vital mechanism making possible cerebral blood supply to active brain areas, is unknown in organisms fed a high-caloric Western Diet (WD) since adolescence. We mapped changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the somatosensory cortex in response to whisker stimulation in adolescent, adult, and middle-aged mice fed a WD since adolescence. To this aim, we used non-invasive and high-resolution functional ultrasound imaging (fUS). We efficiently mimicked the metabolic syndrome of adolescents in young mice with early weight gain, dysfunctional glucose homeostasis, and insulinemia. Functional hyperemia is compromised as early as 3 weeks of WD and remains impaired after that in adolescent mice. These findings highlight the cerebrovascular vulnerability to WD during adolescence. In WD, ω-6:ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) ratio is unbalanced towards proinflammatory ω-6. A balanced ω-6:ω-3 PUFAs ratio in WD achieved by docosahexaenoic acid supplementation efficiently restores glucose homeostasis and functional hyperemia in adults. WD triggers a rapid impairment in cerebrovascular activity in adolescence, which is maintained at older ages, and can be rescued by a PUFA-based nutraceutical approach."

Outcomes of interest included cardiac structure and mass, cardiac events, and cerebrovascular events. Fifty-two citations (41 studies) were included. Reductions in interventricular septal thickness (IVST) and/or left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) were demonstrated in six studies (follow-up 1-6 years, <i>n</i> = 4 using echocardiography, <i>n</i> = 2 cardiac MRI). IVST ranged from 12.1-14.9 mm at baseline and 10.8-14.1 mm at follow-up (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). LVPWT ranged from 11.7-16.0 mm at baseline and 10.7-13.0 mm at follow-up (all <i>p</i> < 0.05).

Rates of composite cardiac events (3.8%-24.0%; four studies, follow-up 2-10 years) and cerebrovascular events (0.0%-18.9%; 12 studies, follow-up 1-10 years) were numerically lower than rates for placebo (follow-up 3 years).

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive, multisystemic X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, often leading to renal failure. Although several screening programs have been conducted, the prevalence of FD in patients with chronic kidney patients who are not dependent on dialysis (NDD-CKD) is likely underestimated due to restrictive inclusion criteria and methodological shortcomings. This study aims to assess the prevalence of FD in NDD-CKD patients using an expanded screening approach. Ongoing outpatients attending Italian nephrology clinics were screened by assay of plasma α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity. Genetic testing was also performed in all females and males with low α-Gal A activity. Inclusion criteria were: (1) females ≥18 years old; (2) males aged between 18 and 70 years; (3) NDD-CKD stages 1-5. Patients with histological diagnosis of glomerulonephritis or diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) were excluded. Demographic data and laboratory results were also collected. Among 385 NDD-CKD outpatients, 173 underwent screening. One patient with three family members carrying a novel mutation (c.320 A > G, p.Q107R); one patient with three family members carrying a silent mutation (c.48 T > G, p.L16L) and two patients with a missense mutation (c.376A > G, p.S126G), were identified. Overall, the prevalence of FD was 2.3%, increasing to 5.4% (10 in 183) with family screening. FD may be more common than previously believed, particularly within NDD-CKD populations. FD screening should be expanded to include NDD-CKD patients with known causes of CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and genetic testing should be routinely used for female patients."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a rare genetic disease with X-linked transmission characterized by a defect in the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which impairs glycosphingolipid metabolism and leads to an excessive storage of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) within lysosomes. AFD involves renal, cardiac, vascular, and nervous systems and is mainly observed in male patients with onset in childhood, although cardiac manifestation is often shown in adults. AFD cardiomyopathy is caused by the accumulation of Gb3 within myocytes first showed by left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy and systolic heart failure with biventricular involvement. The diagnosis of AFD cardiomyopathy may be insidious in the first stages and requires accurate differential diagnosis with other cardiomyopathies with hypertrophic phenotype. However, it is fundamental to promptly initiate specific therapies that have shown promising results, particularly for early treatment. A careful integration between clinical evaluation, genetic tests, and cardiac imaging is required to diagnose AFD with cardiac involvement. Basic and advanced echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear imaging may offer pivotal information for early diagnosis (Graphical Abstract), and the management of these patients is often limited to centres with high expertise in the field. This clinical consensus statement, developed by experts from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging of the ESC, aims to provide practical advice for all clinicians regarding the use of multimodality imaging to simplify the diagnostic evaluation, prognostic stratification, and management of cardiac involvement in AFD."

Given the potential of improving HRQoL for the long-term outcomes of kidney transplantation, we conducted a rapid review of the last 5 years of quality of life evaluation after adult allogeneic kidney transplantation. A rapid evidence analysis was carried out using a literature search in MEDLINE in the period 2019-2024. The primary literature search yielded 554 hits, and ultimately only 12 cohort studies could be included, of which 2 were retrospective and 10 prospective cohort studies. Kidney transplant patients have better HRQoL than patients with end-stage renal disease. HRQoL is influenced by physical, psychological, and social factors. Further improvement of HRQoL or the primary influencing factors has the potential to further enhance the outcomes of kidney transplantation. However, studies to identify suitable interventions are lacking. Interesting factors to be influenced could be, for example, respiratory symptoms and support for professional reintegration. Future studies should focus on the identification of adequate interventions to further improve HRQoL in kidney transplant recipients."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease is a hereditary, progressive, multisystemic lysosomal storage disorder caused by a functional deficiency of the enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-GalA). This defect is due to mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene, located in the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq21-22). Functional deficiency of the α-GalA enzyme leads to reduced degradation and accumulation of its substrates, predominantly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), which accumulate in the lysosomes of numerous cell types, giving rise to the symptomatology. Clinical diagnosis can still be difficult today due to the peculiarities of the disease, which presents with clinical manifestations that overlap with those of other pathologies and a wide possibility of differential diagnoses, which lead to missed diagnoses, misdiagnosis, or a diagnostic delay. Patients with clinical suspicion of Fabry disease undergo a diagnostic workup that includes an evaluation of α-GALA enzyme activity, genetic analysis of the <i>GLA</i> gene, and the measurement of blood Lyso-Gb3, a soluble derivative of Gb3. In this paper, we describe four novel mutations identified in the <i>GLA</i> gene which are associated with absent or reduced α-GalA activity, pathological accumulation of the specific substrate, and characteristic clinical manifestations of Fabry disease. We identified two mutations (c.583insGAATA and p.Y207X) that result in the formation of a premature translation stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein and thus a completely non-functional enzyme. The other two identified gene alterations (p.G261C and c.786G>T, which determine p.W262C) are missense mutations that cause reduced α-GALA activity, the accumulation of blood Lyso-Gb3, and symptoms consistent with Fabry disease, and therefore may be associated with this disorder. The identification of these new mutations in patients with symptoms attributable to Fabry disease increases the molecular knowledge of the <i>GLA</i> gene and provides important support to the clinician, for a more accurate and timely diagnosis of the pathology."

The partial or total defect of this lysosomal enzyme, which is caused by variants in the <i>GLA</i> gene, leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, mainly globotriaosylceramide in the lysosomes of different cell types. The clinical presentation of Fabry disease is multisystemic and can vary depending on the specific genetic variants associated with the disease. To date, more than 1000 different variants have been identified in the human <i>GLA</i> gene, including missense and nonsense variants, as well as small and large insertions or deletions. The identification of novel variants in individuals exhibiting symptoms indicative of Fabry disease, expands the molecular comprehension of the <i>GLA</i> gene, providing invaluable insights to physicians in the diagnosis of the disease. In this article, we present the case of two members of the same family, mother and son, in whom a new pathogenic variant was identified. This variant has not been previously described in the literature and is not present in databases. The two family members presented with a number of typical clinical manifestations of the disease, including cornea verticillata, neuropathic pain, left ventricular hypertrophy, angiokeratomas and abdominal pain. The son, but not his mother, showed reduced alpha-galactosidase A activity, while high levels of Lyso-Gb3 in the blood, a specific substrate accumulation biomarker, were found in both. Sequencing of the <i>GLA</i> gene revealed the presence of a variant, c.484delT, which is characterised by the deletion of a single nucleotide, a thymine, in exon 3 of the gene. This results in a frameshift variant, which introduces a premature stop codon, thereby generating a truncated and consequently non-functional protein. Therefore, the clinical and laboratory data indicate that the novel p.W162Gfs*3 variant described herein is associated with the classical form of Fabry disease."

These cardiomyopathies are often difficult to diagnose and so result in significant morbidity and mortality. The human microbiome, composed of billions of microorganisms, influences various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that gut dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition of intestinal bacteria, can contribute to systemic inflammation, a key factor in many cardiovascular conditions. An increase in gut permeability, frequently caused by dysbiosis, allows bacterial endotoxins to enter the bloodstream, activating inflammatory pathways that exacerbate cardiac dysfunction. Recent reports highlight the potential role of microbiome in amyloidogenesis, as certain bacteria produce proteins that accelerate the formation of amyloid fibrils. Concurrently, advancements in amyloidosis treatments have sparked renewed hopes, marking a promising era for managing these kinds of diseases. These findings suggest that the gut-heart axis may be a potential factor in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease like RCM, opening new paths for therapeutic intervention.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is one of the treatment options for FD and the most recently approved ERT agent, pegunigalsidase alfa, has shown clinical efficacy in three phase 3 clinical trials of adults with FD: BALANCE, BRIDGE, and BRIGHT. Recent published guidelines support the mapping of health utility state data to the EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) index to align with the preferred methodology used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to estimate EQ-5D-3L values in clinical trials of pegunigalsidase alfa for FD for future cost-utility analyses. A mixed effects model was developed to predict values derived from EQ-5D-3L for the following health states used in cost-utility analyses: no Fabry clinical event (FCE)/no pain-related adverse event (AE), pain-related AE, cardiac FCE, cerebrovascular FCE, and renal FCE. The baseline EQ-5D-3L utility value had a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) impact on utility values, whereas study, age, sex, disease type, treatment arm, kidney function, and serious AE were not statistically significant. Health state utility values with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the final model were as follows: no FCE/no pain-related AE, 0.8005 (0.7675, 0.8334); pain-related AE, 0.7737 (0.7262, 0.8211); cardiac FCE, 0.7189 (0.6274, 0.8103); cerebrovascular FCE, 0.7923 (0.6633, 0.9212); and renal FCE, 0.6881 (0.3887, 0.9874). The utility values generated by the present study are generally in line with EQ-5D values in the FD literature and can be used to inform both economic evaluations and our understanding of the impact that FD has on quality of life.

    "abstract": "Hereditary heart disease (HHD) is a series of cardiac disorders associated with monogenic or polygenic abnormalities and is one of the leading causes of sudden death, particularly in young adults. The updated European Cardiology guideline for cardiomyopathies provides the first comprehensive summary of genotyping, imaging, and therapy recommendations for inherited cardiomyopathies, but still lacks a comprehensive discussion of research advances and future trends in genetic diagnosis and therapy of HHD. Our research aims to fill this gap. Bibliometric analysis software (CiteSpace 6.3.R1, VOSviewer 1.6.18, and Scimago Graphica) was used to analyze the general information, trends, and emerging foci of HHD in the past 20 years, including author, country, institution, keyword, and so on. There were 5,757 publications were screened and aggregated in the database, including 1876 reviews and 3,881 articles. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), Brugada syndrome (BrS), myocardial amyloidosis, and Fabry disease (FD) were the main types of HHD that were explored in greater depth. Moreover, new diagnostic methods, clinical cohorts, and genetically targeted therapies for HHD patients are key research hotspots. The relationship between the pathogenicity of genes and prognosis will become increasingly important for therapy."

The hemodynamic change in FD patients remains unclear. To explore HDF changes in FD and the potential of HDF measurements as diagnostic markers indicating early cardiac changes in FD. Single-center, prospective, observational study. Forty-six FD patients (age: 38 ± 12, females: 45.65%) and 46 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). 3 T, cardiac MRI including steady-state free precession cine imaging (during multiple breath-holds), phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, and motion-corrected modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence for T1 mapping. Analysis of strains and HDF were performed on the cine imaging. HDF parameters includes apical-basal force, systolic impulse, systolic peak, systolic-diastolic transition, diastolic deceleration, and atrial thrust. Moreover, FD patients were categorized with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH+) (the maximal wall thickness >12 mm) or without LVH (LVH-). Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) score was calculated to measure the progression of FD. Group comparison tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were performed. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. FD patients showed significantly lower native T1 (1161.1 ± 55.4 vs. 1202.8 ± 42.0 msec) and higher systolic impulse (33.8 ± 9.9 vs. 24.8 ± 9.5%). The systolic impulse in HDF analysis increased even in the pre-hypertrophic stage. The increased myocardial global longitudinal strain (r = 0.419) and systolic impulse (r = 0.333) showed positive correlations with a higher MSSI score. The AUC of systolic impulse and global native T1 showed no significant difference (0.764 vs. 0.790, P = 0.784). Increased systolic impulse and systolic peak can be observed in FD patients. Systolic impulse showed potential ability for screening pre-LVH FD patients and correlated with disease severity in FD patients. This study explored hemodynamic changes in patients with Fabry disease (FD) using hemodynamic force (HDF) analysis based on cardiac MRI. 46 FD patients were included and analysis of cardiac function, native T1, strains, and hemodynamic changes on cardiac MRI images were performed. The results showed that systolic impulse and systolic peak of HDF analysis were increased in FD patients, and systolic impulse may increase even in the pre-hypertrophic stage. Systolic impulse was correlated with disease severity in patients with FD, which may be a potential image-based diagnosis and monitoring marker in FD patients. 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2."

    "abstract": "T1 mapping on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is useful for diagnosis and prognostication in patients with light-chain cardiac amyloidosis (AL-CA). We conducted this study to evaluate the performance of T1 mapping parameters, derived from artificial intelligence (AI)-automated segmentation, for detection of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and their prognostic values in patients with AL-CA. A total of 300 consecutive patients who underwent CMR for differential diagnosis of LVH were analyzed. CA was confirmed in 50 patients (39 with AL-CA and 11 with transthyretin amyloidosis), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 198, hypertensive heart disease in 47, and Fabry disease in 5. A semi-automated deep learning algorithm (Myomics-Q) was used for the analysis of the CMR images. The optimal cutoff extracellular volume fraction (ECV) for the differentiation of CA from other etiologies was 33.6% (diagnostic accuracy 85.6%). The automated ECV measurement showed a significant prognostic value for a composite of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in patients with AL-CA (revised Mayo stage III or IV) (adjusted hazard ratio 4.247 for ECV ≥40%, 95% confidence interval 1.215-14.851, p-value = 0.024). Incorporation of automated ECV measurement into the revised Mayo staging system resulted in better risk stratification (integrated discrimination index 27.9%, p = 0.013; categorical net reclassification index 13.8%, p = 0.007). T1 mapping on CMR imaging, derived from AI-automated segmentation, not only allows for improved diagnosis of CA from other etiologies of LVH, but also provides significant prognostic value in patients with AL-CA."

Echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) have an established diagnostic role, but their prognostic value remains unresolved. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to assess the prognostic implications of imaging parameters in FD. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for studies from inception through 1 May 2024. Studies including FD patients undergoing baseline imaging assessment and clinical follow-up were selected. Pre-defined study outcomes were a cardiovascular endpoint and a composite clinical endpoint. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID CRD42022342394). Fourteen studies, including 1713 FD patients (44.7% males), were selected.

T1-mapping was associated with the composite endpoint (HR: 0.99 per msec increase; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00). Meta-regression analysis did not show any significant interaction between each of the potential effect modifiers. Several imaging parameters were significant predictors of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with FD. Late gadolinium enhancement showed the strongest association with adverse prognosis."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in molecular biomarkers and therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease have brought into focus the need for greater progress in the second most common cause of dementia, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We examine how the study of monogenic causes of VCID has contributed to the understanding of its pathophysiology and potential biomarker and treatment research. It is widely accepted that conditions which disrupt the cerebral small vessels contribute to vascular pathologies including stroke and cerebral microbleeds, ultimately leading to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Among these conditions are a range of monogenic small vessel diseases (SVDs) such as CADASIL, CARASIL, Fabry disease and COL4A-related disorders. This review indicates the importance of furthering research into monogenic SVDs in order to gain insight into the pathomechanisms of VCID more broadly. Monogenic conditions are easier to model than sporadic VCID and can serve as a guide for identifying biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring and intervention outcomes."

Although Fabry disease is X-linked, <i>GLA</i> gene variants in females can exhibit a wide range of symptoms, challenging the traditional view of Fabry as an X-linked recessive disease. A family is presented here with a 36-year-old female who is symptomatic with chronic kidney disease and her oligosymptomatic 70-year-old father, both of whom have a heterozygous and hemizygous GLA pathogenic variant, respectively, c.1087C>T (p.R363C). Interestingly, the proband's Lyso-GL-3 levels were lower than her father's despite her more severe clinical presentation. The discordance between clinical severity and Lyso-GL-3 levels, particularly in the context of migalastat therapy, raises questions about the appropriate interpretation and use of this biomarker. The earlier and more severe symptom onset in the female proband suggests the potential role of genetic modifiers or other factors influencing disease expression. This report underscores the complexity of Fabry disease phenotypes and the limitations of current biomarkers in predicting disease severity, particularly in females. The observed paradox between clinical symptoms and biomarker levels suggests the need for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving phenotypic variability in Fabry disease."

Of these, at least 30 present with central nervous system (CNS) neurodegeneration and overlapping aetiology. Substrate accumulation and dysfunctional neuronal lysosomes are common denominator, but how variants in 30 different genes converge on this central cellular phenotype is unclear. Equally unresolved is how the accumulation of a diverse spectrum of substrates in the neuronal lysosomes results in remarkably similar neurodegenerative outcomes. Conversely, how is it that many other monogenic LSDs cause only visceral disease? Lysosomal substance accumulation in LSDs with CNS neurodegeneration (nLSD) includes lipofuscinoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses and glycoproteinoses. Here, we review the latest discoveries in the fundamental biology of four classes of nLSDs, comparing and contrasting new insights into disease mechanism with emerging evidence of unifying convergence."

    "abstract": "The study was designed to investigate the characteristics of atrial ventricular coupling and left atrial (LA) function impairment in patients with Fabry disease (FD), especially those in the early stages of the condition. A total of 65 patients with Fabry disease who completed echocardiographic examinations from January 2018 to May 2024 were ultimately included. Among them, 25 patients with FD did not have left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH). Additionally, 65 healthy controls were matched to the overall FD population by gender and age, from which 25 controls were selected to match 25 FD patients without LVH based on gender and age. The differences in left atrioventricular coupling index (LACI) and left atrial function between the total FD patients and the healthy control group, as well as between the FD patients without LVH and the healthy control group, were compared. The effect of age on the evolution of LA strain and LACI in FD patients without LVH was examined by adding an interaction term (FD × age) to the models. The correlation between LA and LV parameters in early and total FD patients was evaluated using the Pearson's correlation. For early Fabry disease patients without LVH, LA reservoir function, contractile function, and LACI were all impaired compared to the control group. LACI in early FD patients increased by 0.007 more per year than in healthy controls (P = 0.004). This increase was mainly due to the faster increase in the minimum LA volume in early Fabry disease patients (P = 0.001). In early FD patients, LACI was positively correlated with age and E/e', and negatively correlated with LASr. This study found that both LA function and LACI were impaired in early FD patients, with LACI exhibiting a faster upward trend in early-stage FD compared to the control group, further highlighting its value in Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare disorder resulting from a genetic mutation characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipids in various cells throughout the human body, leading to progressive and irreversible organ damage, particularly in males. Genetically-determined deficiency or reduced activity of the enzyme (alpha - Galactosidase; α-Gal) leads to the accumulation of sphingolipids in the lysosomes of various cell types, including the heart, kidneys, skin, eyes, central nervous system, and digestive system, triggering damage, leading to the failure of vital organs, and resulting in progressive disability and premature death. FD diagnostics currently depend on costly and time-intensive genetic tests and enzymatic analysis, often leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses, which contribute to rapid disease progression. In this research, mid-infrared Fiber Evanescent Wave Spectroscopy (FEWS) supported by statistical analysis and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is shown to be an innovative and reliable method to detect globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) FD biomarker in urine and serum samples by monitoring infrared spectra alone. ML showed a high selectivity for FD in the spectral range of Amide A and Amide I in blood serum, and α-D-galactosyl residues of glycosphingolipids in urine. The developed approach offers a promising, cost-effective express diagnostic tool sensitive enough for early FD detection and monitoring."

This non-classic presentation may make reaching a diagnosis more difficult. In our case, a 63-year-old woman with family history of AFD presenting with chest pain underwent echocardiography which showed LVH. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed confirming LVH as well as identifying extensive late gadolinium enhancement. T1 values were normal.

The abundance of structured clinical data, combined with the mathematical nature of this specialty, makes it an attractive option for AI applications. AI can also play a significant role in addressing health inequities, especially in organ transplantation. It has also been used to detect rare diseases such as Fabry disease early. This review article aims to increase awareness on the basic concepts in machine learning and discuss AI applications in nephrology. It also addresses the challenges in integrating AI into clinical practice and the need for creating an AI-competent nephrology workforce. Even though AI will not replace nephrologists, those who are able to incorporate AI into their practice effectively will undoubtedly provide better care to their patients. The integration of AI technology is no longer just an option but a necessity for staying ahead in the field of nephrology. Finally, AI can contribute as a force multiplier in transitioning to a value-based care model."

    "abstract": "Kidney failure is a prevalent condition with tendency for familial clustering in up to 27% of the affected individuals. Living kidney donor (LKD) transplantation is the optimal treatment option; however, in Canada, more than 45% of LKDs are biologically related to their recipients which subjects recipients to worse graft survival and donors to higher future risk of kidney failure. Although not fully understood, this observation could be partially explained by genetic predisposition to kidney diseases. Genetic testing of potential LKDs may improve risk assessment and inform the safety of donation. The strategies to evaluate these donors are still evolving. In Canada, little is known about the practice of assessing for genetic conditions among LKDs. The aim was to examine the Canadian practices regarding LKDs genetic assessment. Questionnaires were sent to 23 Canadian adult transplant centers to examine their protocols for LKDs genetic assessment. The questionnaire comprised of 10 sections and 21 questions including case scenarios of different LKD encounters. Major domains of the survey addressed general demographics, information sharing practices, effect of mode of inheritance on candidacy decision, having a policy for LKD genetic evaluation, and case scenarios covering the following conditions: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Alport syndrome, Fabry disease, familial focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD), sickle cell, and apolipoprotein L1 mutation (APOL1). The questionnaire was sent to the living-donor assessment committee representative (nephrologist) in adult and pediatric kidney transplant centers across Canada. In total, 16 of 23 Canadian centers responded to the survey. Of the 8 surveyed genetic conditions, ADPKD, Alport syndrome, and aHUS were the most frequently encountered. More centers have specific policies for donor evaluation for ADPKD (25%) and aHUS (21.4%) vs none to very few for other genetic conditions. The most cited guidelines are Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), Canadian Society of Nephrology/Canadian Society of Transplantation (CSN/CST), and the Canadian Blood Services' Kidney Paired Donation Protocol. Canadian transplant centers follow a case-by-case approach rather than a standard protocol for genetic assessment of LKDs given that current guideline recommendations are based on expert opinion due to a lack of a reliable body of evidence. With the expected rise in utilization of the increasingly available genetic testing, early multidisciplinary assessment including medical geneticists has the potential to improve personalized management. Studies examining long-term donor and graft outcomes are needed to construct the basis for evidence-based recommendations and inform the safety of donations."

FD prevalence in high-risk HCM populations ranges from 0.3% to 11.8%. Early diagnosis of FD is crucial due to available treatments, but its rarity and diverse symptoms complicate identification. Heart-specific FD variants often lead to late diagnoses due to the absence of typical FD symptoms. This prospective study (NCT04943991) was conducted to identify patients with undiagnosed FD using electronic health records (EHR) at a German tertiary-care hospital. Over 20 years (2000-2020), 2824 patients with 'left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)' or 'hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)' were identified by full-text search. Exclusion criteria were age over 85, other diagnosed cardiomyopathies, significant valvular heart disease, death, active malignancy and prior FD testing. The remaining patients received an invitation for FD genetic testing. Of the 2824 identified patients, 2626 (93%) fulfilled the exclusion criteria. Among the 198 included patients, 96 responded, and 55 underwent genetic testing, yielding a response rate of 48% and a testing rate of 28%. In one patient (1.8% of tested), FD was diagnosed with the <i>p.N215S</i> variant. Subsequent family screening revealed six additional FD cases, with four initiating FD-specific therapies. Comprehensive clinical evaluations were conducted in five of the seven identified patients. Genetic testing of patients with unexplained LVH/HCM using EHR is effective for identifying FD. Subsequent family screening further identified at-risk individuals, promoting regular follow-ups and if needed FD-specific therapies. This approach highlights the potential for broader application in high-risk populations to uncover treatable genetic conditions. The next phase should focus on automating the executed search process.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to a deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) activity. Our goal was to correct the enzyme deficiency in Fabry patients by transferring the cDNA for α-gal A into their CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Overexpression of α-gal A leads to secretion of the hydrolase; which can be taken up and used by uncorrected bystander cells. Gene-augmented HSPCs can circulate and thus provide sustained systemic correction. Interim results from this 'first-in-the-world' Canadian FACTs (Fabry Disease Clinical Research and Therapeutics) trial were published in 2021. Herein we report 5-year 'End-of-Study' results. Five males with classical Fabry disease were treated. Their HSPCs were mobilized, enriched, and transduced with a recombinant lentivirus engineering expression of α-gal A. Autologous transduced cells were infused after conditioning with a nonmyeloablative, reduced dose, melphalan regimen. Safety monitoring was performed. α-Gal A activity was measured in plasma and peripheral blood (PB) leucocytes. Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and lyso-Gb3 levels in urine and plasma were assessed by mass spectrometry. qPCR assays measured vector copy number in PB leucocytes. Antibody titers were measured by ELISA. Body weight, blood pressure, urinary protein levels, eGFR, troponin levels, and LVMI were tracked. Four out of 5 patients went home the same day as their infusions; one was kept overnight for observation. Circulating α-gal A activity was observed at Day 6-8 in each patient following infusion and has remained durable for 5+ years. LV marking of peripheral blood cells has remained durable and polyclonal. All 5 patients were eligible to come off biweekly enzyme therapy; 3 patients did so. Plasma lyso-Gb3 was significantly lower in 4 of 5 patients. There was no sustained elevation of anti-α-gal A antibodies. Patient weight was stable in 4 of the 5 patients. All blood pressures were in the normal range. Kidney symptoms were stabilized in all patients. This treatment was well tolerated as only two SAEs occurred (during the treatment phase) and only two AEs were reported since 2021. We demonstrate that this therapeutic approach has merit, is durable, and should be explored in a larger clinical trial. This was the first gene therapy clinical trial to be completed for Fabry disease. There were no adverse events of any grade attributable to the cellular gene therapy intervention or host conditioning throughout the follow-up interval of 5 years. After reduced-intensity melphalan treatment, all patients engrafted their autologous modified α-gal A expressing cells. All patients synthesized and secreted α-gal A throughout the course of the study. Expression of α-gal A resulted in a decrease in plasma lyso-Gb3 in four of five patients and stabilization of kidney symptoms in all patients."

The aim of NBS is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns as early as possible, before the onset of disease symptoms. Early diagnosis enables timely treatments and improves the quality of life for affected patients. A pilot project for dried blood spot (DBS) NBS of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), including Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPSI, IDUA α-L-iduronidase deficiency), Pompe disease (GAA α-glucosidase acid deficiency), Gaucher disease (GBA β-glucosidase deficiency) and Fabry disease (GLA α-galactosidase deficiency), was conducted using the digital microfluidic (DMF) technique. DBS were analyzed in a multiplexed assays for the enzymatic activities of four lysosomal enzymes (IDUA, GAA, GBA, GLA), and subjects identified as deficient in any of these enzymes were referred to the clinical reference center for diagnosis confirmation. From June 6th, 2022, to May 12th, 2023, a total of 7650 newborns were analyzed and 1 subject affected by Pompe disease was identified together with two additional subjects, suspected of Pompe and Fabry disease respectively, for whom continued follow-up is mandatory to determine the phenotype. The pilot project for DBS NBS of four LSDs in Campania Region validated the effectiveness of DMF method, established enzymatic activity cut-offs, and identified newborns referred to the clinical center for integrated diagnostics, including genetic analyses. The results suggest that this technique can effectively detect potentially affected newborns, who will require further diagnostic confirmation and clinical follow-up.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) patients are known to be at high risk of developing neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression and cognitive deficits. Despite this, they are underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is unknown whether these symptoms arise from pathological glycosphingolipid deposits or from cerebrovascular abnormalities affecting neuronal functions in the central nervous system. We therefore aimed to fill this knowledge gap by exploring a transgenic FD mouse model with a combination of behavior, transcriptomic, functional and morphological assessments, with a particular focus on the hippocampus. Male FD mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field test, accompanied by a reduced exploratory drive in the Barnes maze, which could be related to the increased deposition of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) identified in the dentate gyrus (DG). Hippocampus single-cell sequencing further revealed that Gb3 accumulation was associated with differential gene expression in neuronal and non-neuronal cell populations with granule, excitatory and interneurons, as well as microglia and endothelial cells as the main clusters with the most dysregulated genes. Particularly FD hippocampal neurons showed decreased electrical baseline activity in the DG and increased activity in the CA3 region of acutely dissected hippocampal slices. Our study highlights transcriptional and functional alterations in non-neuronal and neuronal cell clusters in the hippocampus of FD mice, which are suggested to be causally related to anxiety-like behavior developing as a consequence of FD pathology in mouse models of the disease and in patients."

It can affect both males and females and can be classified into classic or later-onset phenotypes. The disease severity in females ranges from asymptomatic to the more severe, classic phenotype. Most females are hemizygous and the X-linked inheritance is associated with variable X-activation pattern and residual enzymatic activity. The heterogeneity of clinical presentation in females requires different approaches to diagnosis and management than males. A European group of 7 physicians, experienced in the management of Fabry disease, convened to discuss patient perspectives and published guidelines. The experts discussed the need to focus on psychological treatment in relation to individual coping styles when monitoring targets, and the lack of data supporting the use of plasma globotriaosylsphingosine over enzyme activity in the diagnosis of these patients. It was suggested that the high phenotypic variability in female patients may be related to the dynamic nature of the X-chromosome inactivation process and further understanding of this process could help predict the progression of Fabry disease in females and facilitate timely intervention. Due to the range of disease severity they exhibit, female patients with Fabry disease may require a more individualized treatment approach than males. Despite current recommendations, the experts agreed that early disease-specific treatment initiation in high-risk females could improve clinical outcome."

Since then, MC has been detected in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife in the lagoon. Potential public health effects associated with MC exposure along the IRL include an increased risk of non-alcoholic liver disease among area residents. Yet, there are limited studies characterizing liver disease, as well as the potential role of MC, in humans and animals in this region. Thus, histopathology reports (<i>n</i> = 133) were reviewed in the stranded common bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus truncatus</i>) (<i>n</i> = 156, 2005-2024) to describe liver lesions in this important IRL sentinel. Liver and fecal samples (<i>n</i> = 161) from stranded individuals were screened for MC via an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). These samples were then confirmed via the 2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid technique (MMPB) to evaluate whether liver histopathologic lesions were linked to MC exposure. Minimally invasive MC screening methods were also assessed using respiratory swabs and vapor. Inflammation (24%, <i>n</i> = 32), fibrosis (23%, <i>n</i> = 31), lipidosis/vacuolation (11%, <i>n</i> = 15), and necrosis (11%, <i>n</i> = 14) were the most common liver anomalies observed. These non-specific lesions have been reported to be associated with MC exposure in numerous species in the peer-reviewed literature. Ten bottlenose dolphins tested positive for the toxin via ELISA, including two individuals with hepatic lipidosis, but none were confirmed by MMPB. Thus, this study did not provide evidence for MC-induced liver disease in IRL bottlenose dolphins. Other causes should be considered for the lesions observed (e.g., heavy metals, metabolic disease, and endoparasites). Respiratory swabs require further validation as a pre-mortem MC screening tool in free-ranging wildlife."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including severe complications, such as end-stage renal disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cerebrovascular disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), when initiated early, has been shown to reduce the incidence of severe events and slow disease progression. In the classic form, characterized by the absence of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) enzyme activity, diagnosis is straightforward. However, when residual activity is present, the delayed and less obvious presentation can make diagnosis more challenging. Ophthalmological alterations, which can be detected through non-invasive examinations may play a crucial role in correctly assessing the patient in terms of diagnosis and prognosis, particularly in these atypical cases. Recognizing these ocular signs allows for timely intervention with ERT, leading to improved patient outcomes. This review highlights the importance of ophthalmological findings in FD, emphasizing their role in diagnosis and treatment planning. By raising awareness among ophthalmologists and healthcare specialists, this review aims to improve disease management, offering tools for early detection and better long-term prognosis in patients with FD."

The use of urine samples dried on filter paper (DUS) is a non-invasive strategy that simplifies the collection, storage, and shipping of samples compared to using liquid urine specimens. (1) Develop and validate a multiplex ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) methodology using DUS to quantify twenty-one lysosphingolipids normalized to creatinine for eight different sphingolipidoses. (2) Establish normal reference values to evaluate the clinical utility of the methodology. Samples were eluted from a 5 cm filter paper disk (~1 mL of urine) and extracted on Oasis MCX solid-phase extraction cartridges prior to injection in the UPLC-MS/MS system. Urinary lysosphingolipids were stable on DUS at -80 °C and -30 °C for 117 days, at 21.5 °C and 4 °C for at least 26 days, and at 35 °C for 3 days. Globotriaosylsphingosine, glucosylsphingosine, and their analogs were elevated in patients with Fabry disease and Gaucher disease, respectively, compared to controls (<i>p</i>-value < 0.0001). The analysis of related analog profiles suggests a better overall reliability in detecting patients early, especially for Fabry patients. This approach is feasible and might be useful for the early detection, monitoring, and follow-up of patients with sphingolipidoses."

At cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), the left ventricle was of normal volumes and preserved global ejection fraction with an asymmetric wall hypertrophy. The evaluation of native myocardial T1 has been calculated at an average global value of 924 ms, compatible with hypertrophic phenotype cardiomyopathy with reduced native T1 values as observed in Anderson-Fabry disease. The genetic analysis confirmed the Anderson-Fabry disease with a mutation in the exon 5 of the GLA gene, revealing the mutation c.644 A>G. This case report demonstrated that the images obtained in CMR and the analysis of the T1 native mapping, compared with the normal values obtained in the Center, may be considered a gatekeeper in the diagnostic assessment, avoiding redundant examinations, reducing costs, and radiological exposure."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) belongs to the group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD), characterized by insufficient enzyme activity responsible for the intra-lysosomal breakdown of various substrates. The result is an uncontrolled accumulation of by-products of cellular metabolism. Lysosomal storage diseases are inherited and transmitted mainly in an autosomal recessive fashion. Without a positive family history, an early diagnosis can often be missed. In addition, the age of clinical manifestation can range from infancy to adulthood - a distinction is made between severe \"classic\" variants of the disorders, presenting in childhood, and forms with late onset. Some of the conditions in this group may not show typical signs of tissue storage, such as liver and spleen enlargement, especially in subtypes associated with neurodegenerative changes. The aim of this expert opinion of the Polish Cardiac Society and the Polish Forum for Fabry Disease is to summarize the current knowledge on FD, present advances in diagnosis and therapy, and disseminate known diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for this group of patients."

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) needs careful differentiation from other cardiomyopathies. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing, but genetic data on differential diagnoses and their relation with clinical outcomes in HCM are still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of genetic variants and the proportion of other cardiomyopathies in patients with suspected HCM in Korea and compare the outcomes of HCM according to the presence of sarcomere gene mutation. We enrolled 1,554 patients with suspected HCM having left ventricular hypertrophy on transthoracic echocardiography between April 2012 and February 2023. Patients who declined genetic testing or who had pure apical HCM without a familial history were excluded. Genetic testing was performed using a next-generation sequencing panel or whole-exome sequencing for cardiomyopathies. We performed cardiovascular magnetic resonance if the diagnosis was inconclusive. Genotype-positive HCM was defined as sarcomere gene mutations of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Adverse clinical outcomes were defined as a composite of all-cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure-related admission, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks, and stroke. Of 492 patients (mean age 49.6 ± 14.7 years, 29.4% women) who underwent genetic testing, 214 (43.5%) had disease-causing gene mutations. After combining gene tests, multi-imaging modality, and clinical information, 447 (90.9%) had HCM, and 27 (5.5%) had Fabry disease. Among the HCM patients, 182 (40.7%) were genotype-positive, and 265 (59.3%) were genotype-negative. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that genotype-positive HCM patients experienced more composite outcomes (log-rank, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In multivariable Cox analysis, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.12; <i>P</i> = 0.010), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% (HR, 5.50; 95% CI, 2.68-11.27; <i>P</i> < 0.001), LA reservoir strain (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; <i>P</i> = 0.037), and positive sarcomere gene mutation (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04-2.78; <i>P</i> = 0.034) were significantly association with composite outcomes. Sarcomere gene mutation had incremental value for predicting adverse outcomes added on NSVT and LVEF < 50%. Genetic testing is helpful in diagnosing HCM, and sarcomere gene mutations in HCM are significantly associated with clinical outcomes."

    "abstract": "Patients with cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of patients who experience high morbidity and mortality. Early cardiac assessment and intervention with access to genetic counselling in a multidisciplinary Cardiomyopathy Clinic may improve outcomes and prevent progression to advanced heart failure. Our prospective cohort study was conducted at a multidisciplinary Cardiomyopathy Clinic with 421 patients enrolled (42.5% female, median age 58 years), including 224 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, 42.9% female, median age 57 years), 72 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, 43.1% female, median age 60 years), 79 with infiltrative cardiomyopathy (65.8% female, median age 70 years) and 46 who were stage A/at risk for genetic cardiomyopathy (54.3% female, median age 36 years). Patients were seen in follow-up at a median of 18 months. A pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant was identified in 28.5% of the total cohort, including 33.3% of the DCM cohort (28% TTN mutations) and 34.1% of the HCM cohort (60% MYBPC3 and 20% MYH7) who underwent genetic testing. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (48.3-69.5% of total cohort, P < 0.001), β-blockers (58.4-72.4%, P < 0.001), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (33.9-41.4%, P = 0.0014) and sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (5.3-27.9%, P < 0.001) all increased at follow-up. Precision-based therapies were also implemented, including tafamidis for transthyretin amyloidosis (n = 21), enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease (n = 14) and mavacamten (n = 4) for HCM. Optimization of medications and devices resulted in improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 27% to 43% at follow-up for DCM patients with reduced LVEF at baseline (P < 0.001) and reduction in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) from 156 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 128 g/m<sup>2</sup> at follow-up for HCM patients with abnormal LVMI at baseline (P = 0.009). Optimization of therapies was associated with stable plasma biomarkers in stage B patients while lowering levels of BNP (619-517.5 pg/mL, P = 0.048), NT-proBNP (777.5-356 ng/L, P < 0.001) and hsTropT (31-22 ng/L, P = 0.005) at follow-up relative to baseline values for stage C patients. Despite stage B patients having overt cardiomyopathy at baseline, stage A and B patients had a similarly high probability of survival (χ2 = 0.204, P = 0.652). The overall cardiovascular mortality rate was low at 1.7% for the cohort (0.5% for stage B and 3.3% for stage C) over a median of 34-month follow-up. Our study demonstrates that a multidisciplinary cardiomyopathy clinic can improve the clinical profiles of patients with diverse genetic cardiomyopathies."

We report our exclusive new surgery for patients with LVOT obstruction, percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA) procedure™ (percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation). The patient recovered well 7 months after operation, and no LVOT obstruction and arrhythmia occurred. A 51-year-old woman with chest tightness after satiety for ∼10 years, aggravated for 2 months. The patient had a history of multiple syncope, syncope after activity or emotional excitement. Echocardiogram demonstrated ventricular septal thickness of 22 mm by the report. Genetic testing revealed gene mutation, which was consistent with FD (GLA: c.643A > C). Biochemical evaluation reported reduced serum α-galactosidase A activity and abnormal serum Lyso-GL-3 enzyme activity. The patient and her families decided to perform PIMSRA operation. After the operation, the septal thickness steadily decreased to 16 mm over the course of 7 months. However, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. This is the first case of cardiac involvement caused by FD mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated with the innovative PIMSRA procedure. Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation procedure can be one of the effective treatments to alleviate cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular obstruction in FD."

Data from 3 consecutive visits of 159 female FD patients from 6 Fabry centers were retrospectively analyzed. According to their treatment, patients were separated in 3 groups (untreated, n = 71; newly ERT-treated, n = 47; long-term ERT-treated, n = 41). Clinical presentation and laboratory data, including plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>) levels were assessed. The observation time ranged from 49 to 62 months. ∼90% of female patients treated with ERT presented with at least one organ manifestation justifying treatment according to current European guidelines. Untreated females showed a less severe disease load with less FD-typical organ damage. All groups presented with a stable cardiac status (all p > 0.05) over time. ERT-treated females presented with a slight yearly loss of estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) over time (both p < 0.05), which was comparable to the natural decline for this age. Plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> levels were higher in ERT-treated females and decreased by 0.95 [-4.44 to 4.08] ng/ml/year (p = 0.0002) in those who were newly ERT-treated. Severely affected females with FD who were treated with ERT, and less severely affected untreated females, showed a broadly stable disease course over 5 years. The treatment decisions were largely based on the European guidelines for FD. In untreated females, it is crucial to explore if organ involvement is FD-related in order to make the correct treatment decision."

Evidence shows that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) can reduce proteinuria and slow progression to end-stage kidney disease in both diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. Evaluate the effects of SGLT2I on kidney function and albuminuria in patients with Fabry disease. Single-centre real-world case series reviewing electronic medical records of patients with Fabry disease who initiated therapy with dapagliflozin or empagliflozin (n = 11). Changes in urine albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR) and creatinine before and after treatment with SGLT2I were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Two-tailed P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Eleven patients were followed for up to 19 months after commencement of SGLT2I. An overall significant reduction in albuminuria (P = 0.05) was seen with SGLT2I use in the Fabry cohort. Median uACR before SGLT2I was 76 mg/mmol (interquartile range (IQR) 47-141) and after SGLT2I was 39 mg/mmol (IQR 18-95) (P = 0.05). All patients with uACR >100 mg/mmol had reduction in albuminuria over the study period. SGLT2Is were well tolerated overall, with only one case resulting in cessation of treatment due to adverse effects. These results suggest SGLT2Is can significantly reduce albuminuria in a portion of patients with Fabry-related kidney disease and offer additional treatment for Fabry nephropathy. Given the nature of the study design and small case numbers, further long-term controlled studies are required to evaluate the long-term efficacy of this medication class in both cardiac and renal outcomes in Fabry disease."

Agalsidase beta, a recombinant form of α-Gal A, is fundamental to enzyme replacement therapy for FD but requires close monitoring for adverse events (AEs). This study retrospectively analyzed the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for agalsidase beta-related AEs. Disproportionality analysis was used for data analysis. A total of 7,611 AE reports for agalsidase beta were analyzed. The most common AEs included pyrexia, pain, chills, malaise, and nausea. Several system organ classes including Cardiac Disorders, General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, and Vascular Disorders, showed positive signals. Subgroup analysis by gender revealed differences in AE reporting, with males exhibiting a higher reporting odds ratio for certain preferred terms such as Renal Transplant and Drug Specific Antibody Present. The FAERS database analysis of agalsidase beta AEs identified a significant number of cardiovascular, renal, and cerebrovascular system-related reports. While agalsidase beta is generally well-tolerated, the study underscores the necessity for gender-specific treatment approaches due to the higher incidence of certain AEs in males."

    "abstract": "The clinical significance of a number of missense variants of <i>α</i>-galactosidase A is often ambiguous. Defective proteostasis of some missense <i>α</i>-galactosidase A variants induced chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response may explain clinical manifestations of non-classic Fabry disease. Classic Fabry disease is caused by <i>GLA</i> mutations that result in loss of enzymatic activity of <i>α</i>-galactosidase A, lysosomal storage of globotriaosylceramide, and a resulting multisystemic disease. In non-classic Fabry disease, patients have some preserved <i>α</i>-galactosidase A activity and a milder disease course. Heterozygous female patients may also be affected. While Fabry disease pathogenesis has been mostly attributed to catalytic deficiency of mutated <i>α</i>-galactosidase A, lysosomal storage, and impairment of lysosomal functions, other pathogenic factors may contribute, especially in nonclassic Fabry disease. We characterized the genetic, clinical, biochemical, molecular, cellular, and organ pathology correlates of the p.L394P <i>α</i>-galactosidase A variant that was identified initially in six individuals with kidney failure by the Czech national screening program for Fabry disease and by further screening in an additional 24 family members. Clinical findings in affected male patients revealed a milder clinical course, with approximately 15% residual <i>α</i>-galactosidase A activity with normal plasma lyso-globotriaosylceramide levels and abnormally low ratio of these values. None of the four available kidney biopsies showed lysosomal storage. Laboratory investigations documented intracellular retention of mutated <i>α</i>-galactosidase A with resulting endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response, which were alleviated with BRD4780, a small molecule clearing misfolded proteins from the early secretory compartment. We observed similar findings of endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response in five kidney biopsies with several other classic and non-classic Fabry disease missense <i>α</i>-galactosidase A variants.

We explored the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with Fabry disease at a major UK referral centre in Greater Manchester serving over 7 million people, to inform early predictors of kidney disease and possible treatment planning. Data were sourced from the electronic records of registered participants from November 2020 to February 2022 of adults diagnosed with Fabry disease, with at least 1 year of follow-up. Four hundred and five participants (female = 223, male = 182) met the initial eligibility criteria. Our study focused on identifying factors linked to incident CKD, with 395 evaluable individuals undergoing outcome analysis over a median of 6.4 years. Findings concluded that 60.5% of participants received disease-modifying treatments, 29.7% experienced non-fatal cardiovascular events, 3.3% developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and 7.3% died. Men had higher use of disease modifying therapy, progression to ESKD requiring kidney replacement therapy, cardiovascular events, and mortality compared to women. Subgroup analysis over 9 years revealed that older age, cardiovascular history, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use, and higher urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) were predictors of faster estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and increased mortality. At baseline, 47.8% of 249 patients with uACR data had CKD, and 25.4% of the remaining individuals developed CKD during follow-up, associated with higher uACR and lower, albeit normal eGFR levels. Over 60% of Fabry disease patients are at lifetime risk of developing CKD, with a substantial risk of mortality, even with initially normal uACR and eGFR values."

    "abstract": "A 60-year-old woman with a recent history of presumed cardiogenic cerebral infarction was referred for surgical removal of a left ventricular mass. She was diagnosed with Fabry disease eight years before. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a mobile echogenic mass in the left ventricular apex. Emergency surgery was carried out to prevent the recurrence of embolism. On cardiopulmonary bypass, the left ventricle was opened in its apical portion and a pedunculated mass was removed from the left ventricular wall. Direct suturing closure followed. The mass was histologically a thrombus composed mainly of erythrocytes and fibrin, without a tumor component. The patient was put on a standard \"heparin taken over by warfarin\" anticoagulation regimen. The postoperative course was clinically uneventful, but immediate transthoracic echocardiography showed an immobile thrombus on the left ventricular suture line. The patient was followed up with intensified anticoagulation and additional antiplatelet therapy. At 7 months after surgery, the patient had not experienced recurrence of embolism. Early thrombogenesis at the surgical site against anticoagulation may feature the highly thrombogenic status in Fabry disease. Therefore, early and strong warfarinization with antiplatelet therapy may be recommended for patients who undergo cardiotomy with this pathology. Fabry disease accelerates thrombogenesis in blood vessels but does so uncertainly in the cardiac chambers. We describe a patient who developed cerebral infarction from left ventricular thrombosis. After a successful surgical removal of the thrombus from the left ventricle, a new thrombus recurred over the ventricular suture line against a diligent but standard anticoagulation regimen."

Enzyme replacement and gene therapies are being developed, and mRNA and oligonucleotide therapies are more recently being considered. Overcoming the challenges of the blood-brain barrier and blood-ocular barrier is crucial for effectively targeting the brain and eye, whatever the therapeutic approach. Nanoparticles and extracellular vesicles are small carriers that can encapsulate a cargo and pass through these cell barriers. They have been investigated as drug carriers for other pathologies and could be a promising treatment strategy for Batten disease. Their use in gene, enzyme, or mRNA replacement therapy of all lysosomal storage disorders, including Mucopolysaccharidoses, Niemann-Pick diseases, and Fabry disease, is investigated in this systematic review. Different nanocarriers can efficiently target the lysosome and cross the barriers into the brain and eyes.

Various immunological methods, particularly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are widely used to measure serum ADA titers in patients with Fabry disease. However, estimating and comparing results of ELISA is challenging because of the absence of a reference antibody. In this study, we developed a genetically engineered chimeric immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody with mouse-derived variable regions that can react with recombinant GLA drugs and human constant regions that are necessary for recognition by the enzyme-conjugated antihuman signal antibody. Using this chimeric antibody as a reference, a new ELISA-based test was designed to measure anti-GLA antibody concentrations in serum samples. After validating the method, serum anti-GLA antibody titers were measured in 31 patients with Fabry disease, and three representative patients were monitored for 36 months after ERT initiation, achieving successful results, particularly in patients with high ADA titers."

    "abstract": "We developed a novel adeno-associated virus 5 gene therapy (AAV5-GLA) expressing human alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) under the control of a novel, small and strong, liver-restricted promoter. We assessed the preclinical potential of AAV5-GLA for treating Fabry disease, an X-linked hereditary metabolic disorder resulting from mutations in the gene encoding GLA that lead to accumulation of the substrates globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine, causing heart, kidney, and central nervous system dysfunction. Effects of intravenously administered AAV5-GLA were evaluated in (1) GLA-knockout mice aged 7-8 weeks (early in disease) and 20 weeks (nociception phenotype manifestation) and (2) cynomolgus macaques during an 8-week period. In both species, AAV5-GLA was observed as safe, generated detectable vector DNA and mRNA levels in liver, and produced stable enzyme activity in liver and plasma. In mice, dose-dependent transgene enzyme activity, cross-correction (substrate reduction) in kidney and heart, and improved nociception lasted over 6 months. Moreover, after delayed administration when animals displayed the nociception phenotype, target organ enzyme activity was present, and accumulated substrates were reduced. Given the strong, durable expression of active GLA with this promoter and favorable profile of adeno-associated virus 5-based gene therapy in humans, AAV5-GLA warrants further investigation in clinical trials for Fabry disease."

    "title": "Overcoming Resistance in Anderson-Fabry Disease: Current Therapeutic Challenges and Future Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) remains a therapeutic challenge despite advances in early diagnosis and the availability of enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs). While early initiation of therapy can mitigate disease progression, resistance mechanisms-such as the development of anti-drug antibodies-limit the efficacy of current treatments, particularly in patients with severe genetic variants. Chaperone therapy provides a targeted option for a subset of patients, yet significant gaps remain in treating those with complete enzyme deficiency. This perspective article explores the existing therapeutic landscape and reflects on emerging treatments, such as mRNA and gene therapies, which hold promise for overcoming the resistance mechanisms. By addressing the limitations of current pharmacological options and considering future innovations, this article aims to outline the path forward for more effective and personalized treatment strategies in Anderson-Fabry disease."

    "title": "Screening for Fabry Disease-Related Mutations Among 829 Kidney Transplant Recipients.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Fabry disease (FD) is a genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by a pathogenic variant in GLA gene coding for a functional alpha-galactosidase A enzyme whose disfunction leads to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in cells, which results in multiple organ disorders. The aim of this study was to identify mutations associated with Fabry disease among 829 kidney transplant recipients and to investigate the correlation between the factors such as age, dialysis vintage, eGFR, proteinuria and corticosteroid dose and the deviations in alpha-galactosidase A and lyso-Gb3 levels. <b>Methods:</b> Dry blood spot samples were collected for genetic analysis. The GLA genetic variants were analysed by an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing approach in all female patients and in male patients with reduced alpha-galactosidase A levels. Alpha-galactosidase A and Lyso-Gb3 were not determined in female patients. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the above-mentioned factors with the activity of alpha-galactosidase A and Lyso-Gb3. <b>Results:</b> Genetic testing was performed in 476 patients, all female patients (334), 69 male patients with decreased level of alpha-galactosidase A activity, one male patient with alpha-galactosidase A levels above the quantification limit and 72 male patients with no interpretable results of alpha-galactosidase A activity due to preanalytical error. In 3 (0.4%) male patients, hemizygous mutations associated with Fabry disease were found, and those were c.427G>A p.(Ala143Thr), c.1181T>C p.(Leu394Pro), and c.352C>T p.(Arg118Cys). The dose of corticosteroid therapy seemed to be positively correlated to alpha-galactosidase A activity and negatively to Lyso-Gb3 levels in blood. <b>Conclusions</b>: Genetic testing of individuals with chronic kidney disease and reporting of genetic variants associated with the Fabry phenotype are important to improve the overall knowledge of the disease. Further research is needed to define factors influencing levels of alpha-galactosidase A and Lyso-Gb3."

    "abstract": "For years, the treatment of many cardiomyopathies has been solely focused on symptom management. However, cardiomyopathies have a genetic substrate, and directing therapy towards the pathophysiology rather than the epiphenomenon of the disease may be a winning strategy. Gene therapy involves the insertion of genes or the modification of existing ones and their regulatory elements through strategies like gene replacement and gene editing. Recently, gene therapy for cardiac amyloidosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy has received approval, and important clinical trials are currently evaluating gene therapy methods for rare heart diseases like Friedreich's Ataxia, Danon disease, Fabry disease, and Pompe Disease. Furthermore, favorable results have been noted in animal studies receiving gene therapy for hypertrophic, dilated, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. This review discusses gene therapy methods, ongoing clinical trials, and future goals in this area."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT is being administered either in specialized clinics or in the home care setting. Studies indicate that home-based ERT can be considered safe and positively effects patient reported outcomes. Due to the higher level of individual care required by nurses when administering ERT at home, questions arise whether this will result in additional costs for health care systems. Since cost data to the German health care system are currently unavailable, this study aims to assess home care ERT costs of LSD patients. The longitudinal study assessed the direct costs of home-based ERT for patients with LSD diseases Fabry, Pompe, Gaucher, and MPS I from 2019 to 2021 on a patient-by-patient basis by evaluating the healthcare documentation. Costs assessed included ERT drug and further administration equipment, time needed to prepare, administer, and post-process the infusion, and travel expenses of nursing staff. Data from 62 patients was analyzed: of these, 29 (46.8%) with Fabry disease, 19 (30.6%) with Pompe disease, 10 (16.1%) with Gaucher disease, and 4 (6.5%) with MPS I. Patients ranged in age from 3 to 79 (mean 40 years); 42% of patients reported comorbidities (19.4% with hypertension, and 10% with heart disease). Mean total ERT-related costs were €369,047 per year across all patients. Approximately 98.5% of these costs were attributable to the infusion therapy and administration itself (€363,880), and approximately 1.5% were attributable to personnel and travel costs. Patients with Pompe disease incurred the highest average annual costs (€483,907) and patients with Fabry disease the lowest (€264,896). Cost differences among underlying LSDs were due primarily to ERT drug costs; the drug infused for Fabry disease costs about half as much as that for Gaucher or for Pompe disease. Despite MPS I patients requiring about twice as many infusions, significantly lower drug costs for this disease resulted in the second lowest total mean costs of all LSD subtypes analyzed. As total costs are almost entirely driven by infusion-related material, especially the ERT drug, moving ERT into the home environment is not expected to increase costs."

    "abstract": "The central nervous system represents a major target tissue for therapeutic approach of numerous lysosomal storage disorders. Fabry disease arises from the lack or dysfunction of the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) enzyme, resulting in substrate accumulation and multisystemic clinical manifestations. Current enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) face limited effectiveness due to poor enzyme biodistribution in target tissues and inability to reach the brain. We present an innovative drug delivery strategy centered on a peptide-targeted nanoliposomal formulation, designated as nanoGLA, engineered to selectively deliver a recombinant human GLA (rhGLA) to target tissues. In a Fabry mouse model, nanoGLA demonstrated improved efficacy, inducing a notable reduction in Gb3 deposits in contrast to non-nanoformulated GLA, even in the brain, highlighting the potential of the nanoGLA to address both systemic and cerebrovascular manifestations of Fabry disease. The EMA has granted the Orphan Drug Designation to this product, underscoring the potential clinical superiority of nanoGLA over authorized ERTs and encouraging to advance it toward clinical translation."

The patient presented to the nephrology clinic with microscopic haematuria and proteinuria on routine tests. A kidney biopsy revealed mesangial matrix widening, mesangial cell proliferation, and podocyte enlargement with prominent lacy and clear cytoplasm, as observed with haematoxylin and eosin staining. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated diffuse immunoglobulin A deposits in the mesangium. Electron microscopy identified myelin-like figures in the cytoplasm of podocytes and electron-dense deposits in the mesangium, confirming IgAN and suggesting FD. Subsequent testing showed low alpha-galactosidase A (α-gal) enzyme activity in the patient's white blood cells, confirming the FD diagnosis. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated following the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the coexistence of FD, IgAN, and CD in a single patient. This case highlights the importance of considering FD in patients with proteinuria, emphasising the need for comprehensive diagnostic evaluations in complex cases."

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), antigens, and antigen-presenting cells drain from the central nervous system (CNS) into lymphatic vessels near the cribriform plate and dura, yet the role of these vessels during stroke is unclear. Using a mouse model of ischemic stroke, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), we demonstrate stroke-induced lymphangiogenesis near the cribriform plate, peaking at day 7 and regressing by day 14. Lymphangiogenesis is restricted to the cribriform plate and deep cervical lymph nodes and is regulated by VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling. The use of a VEGFR-3 inhibitor prevented lymphangiogenesis and led to improved stroke outcomes at earlier time points, with no effects at later time points. VEGF-C delivery after tMCAO did not further increase post-stroke lymphangiogenesis, but instead induced larger brain infarcts. Our data support the damaging role of VEGF-C acutely and a pro-angiogenic role chronically. This nuanced understanding of VEGFR-3 and VEGF-C in stroke pathology advises caution regarding therapeutic VEGF-C use in stroke."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder. The abnormal accumulation of metabolic substrates induces inflammation and fibrosis in cells, resulting in organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of FD are diverse and non-specific. In the present study, we report a case initially treated as obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for several years, which was finally identified as FD through whole-exome sequencing (WES). The patient, diagnosed with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, underwent left ventricular outflow tract surgery before visiting our hospital. WES was proposed by our cardiomyopathy center and, unexpectedly, a mutation [c.595T>C (p.Val199Met)] in exon 4 of the GLA gene was identified. A subsequent analysis of plasma α-galactosidase and globotriaosylsphingosine levels confirmed the diagnosis of FD. Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was initiated immediately after diagnosis, the patient experienced aortic valve damage and left heart enlargement 2 years later. Subsequently, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This case implies that FD should be considered a potential cause in patients with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. Delayed initiation of ERT may compromise its efficacy."

Additionally, the mutations in α-galactosidase lead to Fabry disease. Inhibitors targeting these enzymes are prescribed as anti-diabetic medications and as effective chaperones for Fabry disease. Comprehending the function - regulation of α-glycosidases requires accurate quantification methods. In this work, we highlight the design of a simple luminescent 'turn-on' assay for sensing these two α-glycosidases in a supramolecular TbCh hydrogel matrix using 1-α-glycosides as pro-sensitizers. The protocol offers a cost-effective method for selectively sensing α-glycosidases in the detection limit of the subnanomolar range. Importantly, the developed enzyme sensors functioned as a platform for rapid screening of drug molecules based on their inhibition potency. Therefore, the protocol is useful for facilitating the advancement of therapeutics and diagnostics targeting this important class of enzymes."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disorder leading to multiorgan dysfunction, including renal impairment and the risk of significant accumulation for renally excreted drugs. Migalastat, an approved therapy in FD patients with amenable variants, is primarily eliminated in urine; however, its use had not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving dialysis therapy. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK), dialyzability, and tolerability of 123 mg migalastat in non-FD subjects with ESRD on stable hemodialysis/hemodiafiltration (EudraCT 2018-003684-57). Results were analyzed by population PK and physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling and intended to propose dose regimens resulting in negligible migalastat trough levels in plasma and comparable concentrations above the threshold in target tissues in FD patients with ESRD. Subjects with ESRD received 123 mg migalastat 24 hours before dialysis and, following an 8-day washout, immediately before dialysis. Matched controls with normal renal function (NRF) received migalastat 123 mg. Migalastat concentrations were measured in plasma, urine, and dialysate, and modeled to select regimens providing similar disposition to NRF. Migalastat was extracted by hemodialysis/hemodiafiltration (74%/72%). PBPK modeling predicted that 123 mg every other week (QOW) with regular dialysis 2-3 times weekly in ESRD subjects produced: a fraction of time above EC50 similar to FD patients with NRF; adequate Cmax for intracellular trafficking of mutant α-galactosidase A to the lysosome; and Ctrough levels near the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) similar to NRF subjects receiving 123 mg every other day. Migalastat 82 mg weekly produced a greater fraction of time above EC50 and longer duration of concentrations above the LLOQ, potentially resulting in accumulation in tissues. Migalastat was well extracted by hemodialysis/hemodiafiltration. Migalastat 123 mg QOW is the proposed dose regimen for further evaluation in FD patients with ESRD, which could inform expansion of treatment options.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that is characterized by renal, neurological, and cardiovascular dysfunction. Four treatments are currently available for patients with FD; three enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs; agalsidase alfa, agalsidase beta, and pegunigalsidase alfa) and one pharmacological chaperone (migalastat). This review focuses on the evidence for the benefits of ERTs and migalastat, and provides an overview of their impact on disease manifestations and quality of life (QoL). Agalsidase beta is associated with renal, neurological, and cardiovascular benefits, and may prevent renal disease progression. Agalsidase alfa provides stabilizing effects across all main organ systems, although minor sex-specific differences exist in patients with more advanced baseline disease. The benefits of agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta are similar but depend on the extent of baseline disease. Some data indicate that agalsidase beta may be preferable over the longer term. Both agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta are associated with improved gastrointestinal and pain symptoms, as well as improved QoL. Patients with advanced end-organ damage tend not to respond as optimally to ERTs as those who initiate ERTs before irreversible organ fibrosis develops, highlighting the need for early treatment initiation. Migalastat, which is only approved for patients with amenable missense gene variants, generally stabilizes renal parameters and provides cardiovascular benefits. Migalastat also improves diarrhea and pain, and stabilizes QoL (although ERT may be more effective for pain management), but the neurological effects of migalastat have not been studied. Real-world data raise concerns about effective in vivo amenability of some genetic variants. Future studies with direct treatment comparisons in patients with FD are needed."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare metabolic disorder which presents with considerable heterogeneity in disease characteristics. Given the absence of interventional studies comparing all available treatments, it is important for indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) to account for potential treatment effect modifiers (TEMs). This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to identify patient characteristics that may impact clinical outcomes by analyzing real-world evidence (RWE) in FD. An SLR was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, with searches performed in the EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases (1946-2022; with a recent update in April 2023). Full-text articles reporting clinical outcomes from RWE studies of pharmacological therapies for the treatment of FD were included. Including studies from the recent SLR update, a total of 119 original studies met the PICOS criteria and 25 studies provided insights into TEMS. Potential TEMs in FD were identified: sex, age, timing of treatment initiation (early/delayed), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, presence of anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs) at baseline, and previous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In three studies (two including ERT-treated patients and one study of migalastat-treated patients) males showed worse renal outcomes than females. Five studies found that younger patients and those who received initial ERT before the age of 25 years had greater reductions in plasma-lysoGb3, as well as more favorable renal, cardiac, and biochemical outcomes. Seven studies identified associations between LVH and reduced eGFR at baseline, along with an increased risk of cardiovascular, renal, and neurological events. In four studies, lower baseline eGFR and proteinuria were associated with faster annual eGFR decline despite ERT; high baseline proteinuria was a significant predictor of renal disease progression. Baseline ADAs were linked to lower eGFR, increased left ventricular mass, and reduced treatment impact on plasma/urine-lysoGb3. Migalastat was effective in treatment-naïve patients, while those previously treated with ERT experienced deteriorations in mean lysoGb3, eGFR, and left ventricular mass. This SLR highlighted several patient characteristics that influence treatment effectiveness in FD. It is important to account for these characteristics in ITCs to ensure unbiased outcomes."

Enzyme replacement therapy or pharmacological chaperone therapy can improve prognosis, especially in patients in the early phase of cardiac involvement. Longitudinal strain (LS) evaluated using speckle tracking echocardiography can detect early contractile dysfunction. However, there have been no reports of LS in Japanese Fabry disease patients. We recruited 56 patients with Fabry disease (22 men, 34 women) who were followed up at Jikei University Hospital. Fifty-eight control subjects without overt cardiac diseases were also included in the study. We evaluated LS in each patient, and the values of each of the 17 segments of the left ventricle (LV) were averaged, and global LS (GLS) was also calculated. GLS was significantly worse in Fabry disease patients without LV hypertrophy than in control subjects (-18.5±2.8% vs. -20.4±1.6%; P<0.05). In addition, Fabry disease patients without LV hypertrophy had significantly worse lateral LS (-16.4±5.0% vs. -19.3±1.8%; P<0.05), basal LS (-16.5±3.2% vs. -18.5±1.7%; P<0.05), and mid LS (-18.7±1.7% vs. -20.8±1.6%; P<0.05) than control subjects.

Asthma biomarkers hold promise for stratifying patients into distinct clinical phenotypes, paving the way for targeted and personalized treatment approaches. This study aimed to evaluate the association between novel and non-established semi-invasive circulating and well-known exhaled inflammatory biomarkers in two distinct pediatric asthma populations stratified by disease severity. Forty-four asthmatic children aged 8-12 years meeting inclusion criteria were recruited from hospitalized patients. The first group (n=15, mean age 9.8 years) consisted of patients with mild persistent asthma who did not require regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The second group (n=29, mean age 9.8 years) consisted of children with moderate to persistent asthma who received regular ICS treatment. Serum levels of interleukins (IL-13, IL-1β), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and surfactant protein D (SPD) were measured by ELISA in all participants. In addition, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and blood eosinophil counts were evaluated. No significant differences were observed in the baseline plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers (IL-13, IL-1β, SPD, and EDN) or exhaled FeNO between the ICS-treated and non-ICS-treated groups. Further inter-individual analysis confirmed significant positive correlations between IL-13, SPD, and IL-1β (Pearson's r = 0.591-0.781) in both groups of patients. Interestingly, the ICS-treated group compared to the nontreated group showed an exclusive moderate negative correlation between FeNO and IL-1β. In contrast, FeNO exhibited a positive correlation with EDN and a strong association with eosinophil count in all the study groups. Our findings highlight the complex and unresolved role of asthma biomarkers in routine clinical practice for the management of childhood asthma, particularly in predicting exacerbations. By comparing the relationships of carefully selected biomarkers, we can achieve a greater clinical predictive value."

The most frequent manifestations were acroparesthesias (71.2%), hypohidrosis or anhidrosis (48.1%), heat intolerance (46.2%), and proteinuria (42.3%). Renal and neurological manifestations were more prevalent in males than females. Cardiac involvement included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolf-Parkinson-White arrhythmia.

We found a novel variant GLA c.122C>G that causes an atypical FD phenotype with predominantly neurological involvement in two unrelated patients, one of them with a forthright clinical and radiological overlap of Multiple Sclerosis and normal biological biomarkers, thus requiring a renal biopsy that helped confirm the diagnosis of FD. The genotype and phenotype of Mexican patients with FD are similar to other populations. Atypical phenotype of FD, such as the one associated with the novel variant c.122C>G, can be a diagnostic challenge, as it can be mixed up with MS.

Pharmacokinetics of pegunigalsidase alfa, amino acid, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-specific antibodies and immune complexes were measured in treated patients (11 switched, two naïve). Measurements were performed in serum samples drawn directly before and after infusions over three to ten consecutive infusions. Only three patients started directly with 1.0 mg/kg body weight. No infusion-associated reactions were reported under pegunigalsidase alfa during the observation. Patients without pre-existing neutralizing anti-AGAL antibodies showed high enzymatic AGAL peak activities and sustained AGAL serum concentrations until the next infusion, which was not observed in those with neutralizing anti-AGAL antibodies. Nine (69.2%) patients presented with pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies (IgG or IgM), which seemed to have no impact on pharmacokinetics during the observation. No new anti-PEG or anti-AGAL antibody formation was observed after treatment initiation. Three (75.0%) patients with pre-existing neutralizing anti-AGAL antibodies showed a titer increase and one (25.0%) patient a decrease. In patients with anti-AGAL antibodies (n = 4) immune-complex formation was detected. The pharmacokinetics of pegunigalsidase alfa show different profiles depending on the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, with reduced plasma half-life and peak enzyme activity after infusion in patients with antibodies. The clinical significance of a reduced pegunigalsidase alfa half-life and the formation of immune complexes in antibody-positive patients needs to be analyzed in future studies."

Minigene experiments demonstrated that this variant affected the splicing of GLA, resulting in the production of a truncated protein (p.Pro214SerfsTer10). Western blotting (WB) showed that the truncated protein was retained, while immunofluorescence (IF) analysis indicated partial lysosomal localization. In vitro assays confirmed that the retained protein was non-functional and exerted a dominant-negative effect on the normal GLA protein. Molecular docking analysis further revealed that the truncated protein could bind to the wild GLA monomer, significantly reducing cellular GLA enzyme activity. These findings indicate that, beyond being non-functional, the c.640-814T>C mutation may also exerts a dominant-negative effect that impairs the function of the wild GLA protein. These results highlight the importance of recognizing deep intronic mutations in the diagnosis and treatment of FD, contributing to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms, enriching mutation databases, and providing insights into genotype-phenotype correlations."

    "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of Fabry Disease (FD) can be challenging due to the clinical heterogeneity, especially in females. Patients with FD often experience a prolonged interval between the onset of symptoms and receiving a diagnosis. Genetic testing is the gold standard for precise diagnosis of FD, however conventional genetic testing could miss deep intronic variants and large deletions or duplications. Although next-generation sequencing, which analyzes numerous genes, has been successfully used for FD diagnosis and can detect complex variants, an effective and rapid tool for identifying a wide range of variants is imminent, contributing to decrease the diagnostic delay. The comprehensive Analysis of FD (CAFD) assay was developed for FD genetic diagnosis, employing long-range PCR coupled with long-read sequencing to target the full-length GLA gene and its flanking regions. Its clinical performance was assessed through a comparative analysis with Sanger sequencing. Genetic testing was performed on 82 individuals, including 48 probands and 34 relatives. The CAFD assay additionally identified variants in two probands: one had a novel and de novo pathogenic variant with a 1715 bp insertion in intron 4, and the other carried two deep intronic VUS variants in cis-configuration also in intron 4. In total, CAFD identified 47 different variants among 48 probands. Of these, 42 (89.36%, 42/47) were pathogenic, while 5 (10.64%, 5/47) were VUS. Sixteen (34.04%, 16/47) of the variants were novel, including 15 SNV/Indels and one large intronic insertion. Pedigree analysis of 21 probands identified four de novo disease-causing variants. Hence, FD exhibits not only variable clinical presentations but also a wide spectrum of variants. Utilizing a comprehensive testing algorithm for diagnosing FD, which includes enzyme activity, clinical features, and genetic testing, the diagnostic yield of CAFD is 97.92% (47/48), which is higher than that of conventional Sanger sequencing, at 95.83% (46/48). The duration between initial clinical presentation and diagnosis remains long and winding. CAFD provides precise diagnosis for a wide spectrum of GLA variants, promoting timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment for FD patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme ⍺-galactosidase-A (⍺-Gal A), resulting in widespread accumulation of terminal galactose-containing glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and the impairment of multiple organ systems. Thrombotic events are common in Fabry patients, with strokes and heart attacks being significant contributors to a shortened lifespan in patients of both genders. Previously, we developed an ⍺-Gal A-knockout (KO) murine model that recapitulates most Fabry symptomologies and demonstrated that platelets from KO males become sensitized to agonist-mediated activation. In the current report, we used mass spectrometry, platelet-based assays and histology to define further the mechanisms linking GSL accumulation with thrombotic phenotypes in both sexes. Sera and platelets from ⍺-Gal A-KO females have elevated levels of Fabry-associated GSLs relative to wild-type females, but accumulated less of these GSLs than KO males. Correspondingly, KO females demonstrate a less severe thrombotic phenotypes than KO males. Notably, treatment of platelets from wild-type animals with globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) increased baseline platelet activation and aggregation. In contrast, several control GSLs did not stimulate platelet responses. These data suggest that chronically high concentrations of the Fabry-associated GSL, Gb3, contributes to the prothrombotic phenotypes experienced by Fabry patients by directly stimulating platelet activation."

    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), primarily cystinosis, Fabry disease, and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), are genetic conditions that typically result in multi-organ disease manifestations. Kidney function progressively deteriorates in many cases, with patients eventually reaching end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and requiring renal replacement therapy. Kidney transplantation has been deemed the optimal renal replacement therapy option to achieve long-term survival in patients with IMD. Whilst improved long-term survival is expected, the patterns of clinical evolution for IMD after transplantation remain largely unknown. <i>Methods:</i> Our group conducted a retrospective observational study that included 37 adult patients with IMD (11 with cystinosis, 20 with Fabry disease, and 6 with MMA). The study evaluated the clinical status and progression of these patients following kidney transplantation between January 2010 and December 2023. <i>Results:</i> This generally resulted in good graft outcomes for patients with IMD. Standard immunosuppression regimes included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. The mean graft survival duration was noted to be 12 years in patients with cystinosis, 11 years in patients with Fabry disease, and 7 years in patients with MMA. Suboptimal outcomes were noted with grafts of cadaveric origin and poor adherence to the prescribed post-transplant immunosuppression regime. A greater extra-renal morbidity burden was associated with a reduced duration of graft function and increased mortality in patients with IMD. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our findings emphasise the need for a multi-disciplinary approach in the care of IMD patients following kidney transplantation."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the galactosidase alpha (<i>GLA</i>) gene, resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacetylated form, globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) in various tissues and fluids throughout the body. This pathological accumulation triggers a cascade of processes involving immune dysregulation and complement system activation. Elevated levels of complement 3a (C3a), C5a, and their precursor C3 are observed in the plasma, serum, and tissues of patients with Fabry disease, correlating with significant endothelial cell abnormalities and vascular dysfunction. This review elucidates how the complement system, particularly through the activation of C3a and C5a, exacerbates disease pathology. The activation of these pathways leads to the upregulation of adhesion molecules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1), and complement receptor 3 (CR3) on leukocytes and endothelial cells. This upregulation promotes the excessive recruitment of leukocytes, which in turn exacerbates disease pathology. Targeting complement components C3a, C5a, or their respective receptors, C3aR (C3a receptor) and C5aR1 (C5a receptor 1), could potentially reduce inflammation, mitigate tissue damage, and improve clinical outcomes for individuals with Fabry disease."

Although enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant agalsidase beta has demonstrated clinical benefits, the standard fortnightly, multi-hour infusion regimen imposes a substantial burden on patients. We assessed the safety and feasibility of shortening the agalsidase beta infusion time to 90 min in adult patients with classic or later-onset Fabry disease in the absence of premedication. A total of 39 consecutive adult patients (agalsidase-naïve: n = 7; with significant comorbidities: n = 15) with no recent infusion-associated reactions underwent a total of 85 agalsidase beta infusions in our tertiary reference centre for lysosomal diseases. Each infusion was administered at a constant rate (between 0.78 and 1.17 mg/min, depending on the total dose administered). No adverse events of any type (including discomfort and infusion-associated reactions) were reported during or after infusions. The patients' vital signs and physical examination remained stable, and patients' satisfaction was high. Our results suggest that shortening the agalsidase beta infusion time to 90 min is safe and feasible in stably treated adult patients with Fabry disease and no recent infusion-associated reactions."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) causes multiorgan sphingolipid accumulation, with cardiac involvement responsible for the largest burden of morbidity and mortality. Exercise intolerance in FD is prevalent, yet the mechanisms of this are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to assess exercise intolerance in FD and identify whether this correlates with the phase of cardiomyopathy. This was a retrospective observational study of adults with FD undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX) between September 2011 and September 2023 at a national referral centre in the UK. The primary outcome measure was peak oxygen uptake (V̇O<sub>2peak</sub>), with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) used to quantify respiratory impairment. Age-normalised/sex-normalised values were additionally calculated, based on published normal ranges for subgroups of age and sex. The cardiomyopathy phase was classified on a 4-point scale by two FD experts using contemporaneous imaging and biochemistry results. CPEX was completed by 42 patients, with a median age of 54 years and of whom 62% were male. Patients were approximately equally distributed across the four cardiomyopathy phases. At phase I, the mean (±SD) V̇O<sub>2peak</sub> was 28.7±7.7 mL/kg/min, which represented a significant underperformance of 23%, relative to age-normalised and sex-normalised values (expected mean: 37.3±3.2 mL/kg/min, p=0.006). V̇O<sub>2peak</sub> declined significantly across the cardiomyopathy phases (p=0.010), reaching a mean of 21.2±6.1 mL/kg/min at phase IV. Normalised FEV<sub>1</sub> was not found to show a corresponding significant change with cardiomyopathy phase (p=0.683). Impaired left atrial global longitudinal strain as well as biochemical markers of inflammation were associated with impaired V̇O<sub>2peak</sub>. This study identifies significantly impaired aerobic capacity in FD, even in those without phenotypic cardiomyopathy. No corresponding changes in respiratory impairment were observed, suggesting that exercise intolerance may be due to early cardiac sphingolipid accumulation and subsequent atrial and ventricular dysfunction, which increases as cardiomyopathy progresses. As such, peak V̇O<sub>2peak</sub> holds promise as a therapeutic marker of response to FD-specific therapy."

The M13 bacteriophage (M13) has found utility in sensor applications like disease diagnosis and detection of harmful substances due to its potential for controlling interaction with target substances through adjustments in electrochemical and mechanical properties via genetic engineering technology. However, while optimizing reactivity or binding affinity between M13 and target materials is crucial for sensor performance enhancement, precise dynamic measurement methods for this were lacking. This study demonstrates the application of an M13-based dynamic actuator in a Fabry-Pérot etalon (M13-FPE) as a spacer for precise measurement of humidity and reactivity to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The transmission spectrum is optimized by adjusting the reflectance and cavity gap size (d<sub>M13</sub>) of the two mirrors comprising the M13-FPE, and changes are measured in a rainbow-color-dotted (RCD) pattern using a customized spectrometer. Utilizing the peak wavelengths of the RCD pattern, the change in d<sub>M13</sub> is dynamically and precisely measured, revealing approximately 3% and 0.3% swelling for ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. M13 demonstrates binding affinities of 827 ppb and 158 ppb for ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, respectively, with its low reactivity measured precisely, exhibiting an error of 0.03 nm using the peak wavelength change rate."

CB2R was highly elevated in the plasma of Farber disease and mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA mice, followed by Fabry disease and MPS type I mice. Mice with acid sphingomyelinase-deficient Niemann-Pick disease (ASMD) and rats with MPS type VI exhibited little or no plasma CB2R elevation. High-level expression of CB2R was also observed in tissues of Farber and MPS IIIA mice. Treatment of MPS IIIIA patient cells with CB2R agonists led to a reduction of CB2R and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemotactic factor that is elevated in this LSD. Treatment of MPS IIIA mice with one of these agonists (JWH133) led to a reduction of plasma and tissue CB2R and MCP-1, a reduction of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the brain, and an improvement in hanging test performance. JWH133 treatment of Farber disease mice also led to a reduction of MCP-1 in tissues and plasma, and treatment of these mice by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) led to a reduction of plasma CB2R, indicating its potential to monitor treatment response. Overall, these findings suggest that CB2R should be further examined as a potential therapeutic target for the LSDs and may also be a useful biomarker to monitor the impact of therapies."

Decreased native T1 mapping and a unique late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging are specific imaging markers for FD. Explore the performance of multiparametric CMR imaging in screening for FD in patients with a HCM phenotype. A prospective cohort of 602 patients with a HCM phenotype was assessed from April 2012 to December 2022. Participants underwent CMR imaging and genetic testing. FD diagnosis was according to genetic testing and enzyme-activity test of α-galactosidase A. Multiparameter CMR imaging included cardiac function, native T1 mapping, extracellular volume (ECV), T2 mapping, LGE, and myocardial strains. Diagnostic performance of CMR parameters in identifying FD from HCM was done by analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. FD prevalence was 1.8% (11 cases) in this cohort with HCM. Native T1 mapping was significantly lower in FD compared with HCM (FD vs. HCM: native T1 mapping: 1174.08 ± 60.60 vs. 1293.94 ± 55.86, p < 0.001). Ventricular function, mass, ventricular wall thickness, and strains did not show significant differences between the two groups.

Initially we started molecular analysis of culture cells, model animals and patients with Fabry disease and G<sub>M1</sub>-gangliosidosis. Some mutant enzyme proteins did not express the catalytic activity because of unstable molecular structure in somatic cells. The small molecule compound (chaperone) corrected misfolding of the unstable mutant protein, resulting in restoration of the enzyme activity (chaperone therapy). This pathological molecular event was studied first in endogenous mutant enzymes. Then a similar molecular interaction was found between the chaperone and the exogenous protein supplied for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease. This new chaperone-ERT combination therapy will become another useful technology in order to expand the application of chaperone therapy to a wide range of lysosomal diseases. Thus, chaperone therapy is expected in future for stabilization and enhancement of exogenously supplied ERT enzymes as well as endogenous mutant enzymes."

Furthermore, echocardiographic evaluation is the essential imaging method to support the physician also in the follow-up and risk stratification of AFD patients. Therefore, echocardiography is useful in all stages of the disease, both to reveal the first signs of cardiac involvement and to guarantee timely treatment in the preclinical stage and to estimate the extent of cardiac involvement, define possible complications, and evaluate the response to treatment in patients with established cardiomyopathy.

It contributes to the scientific literature by exploring the intricate relationship between diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders, emphasizing the need for heightened awareness and comprehensive management strategies. The patient, a 34-year-old with longstanding type 1 diabetes, exhibits progressive bilateral camptodactyly, accompanied by peripheral neuropathy and bilateral cataracts. Key clinical findings include permanent flexion deformities of the proximal interphalangeal joints, positive Phalen's and Tinel's signs, and reduced grip strength, highlighting the complex nature of the musculoskeletal manifestations of diabetes. The main diagnoses in this case involve type 1 diabetes mellitus, bilateral camptodactyly, peripheral neuropathy, and potential genetic predisposition to Fabry disease. Therapeutic interventions include insulin therapy for diabetes management, pharmacological interventions for dyslipidemia, surgical intervention for cataracts, and conservative measures such as splinting and occupational therapy for camptodactyly. Despite some stabilization in glycemic control, the patient's hand deformities show limited improvement, emphasizing the challenges in managing complex musculoskeletal complications of diabetes. The main takeaway from this case is the importance of considering atypical complications in diabetes management and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to address complex clinical presentations.

Among prevalent KRT patients, IKD-CAKUT (18.5%) and glomerulonephritis (18.7%) were the two most common causes of kidney failure overall, while IKD-CAKUT was the most common cause in women (21.6%) and in patients <45 years of age (29.1%). IKD and CAKUT are common causes of kidney failure among KRT patients. Distinct categorization of IKD and CAKUT better characterizes the epidemiology of the causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and highlights the importance of genetic testing in the diagnostic workup of CKD."

    "abstract": "Measurement of lysosomal disease (LD) biomarkers can reveal valuable information about disease status. Lyso-globotriaosylceramide (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>), glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>1</sub>), galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), and glucose tetrasaccharide (Glca1-6Glca1-4Glca1-4Glc, Glc<sub>4</sub>) are biomarkers associated with Fabry, Gaucher, Krabbe, and Pompe disease, respectively. Clinical biomarker testing is performed to guide patient management, including monitoring disease progression and initiating treatment, and in diagnostic evaluations of either symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history or abnormal newborn screen. Biomarker analysis can be performed through independent analysis of a single analyte or as a multiplex assay measuring analytes for more than one disorder utilizing liquid chromatographic separation and tandem mass spectrometric detection. These guidelines were developed to provide technical standards for biomarker analysis, results interpretation, and results reporting, highlighting Fabry, Gaucher, Krabbe, and Pompe diseases as examples."

    "title": "Impact of the Covid19 pandemic on health-related quality of life in patients with Fabry disease - implications for future care of patients with rare diseases.",
    "abstract": "The worldwide Covid19 pandemic caused by the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represented a unique challenge for patients and healthcare professionals. Patients with chronic rare diseases had to face novel burdens, like the inability to perform regular on-site visits or even difficulties in the supply of medication. Patients with Fabry disease (FD) are affected by a variety of organ manifestations leading to physical but also psychological burden and limitations, which are usually presented in low health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). We sought to examine the impact of the Covid19 pandemic on HR-QoL in patients with FD and their implications for the future care of patients with rare diseases. This single-center study included patients seen shortly prior to and after the peak of the Covid19 pandemic in 2020 at our study site. All patients had a confirmed genetic diagnosis of FD. Subjects with presumed apathogenic to benigne genetic variants in the GLA gene were excluded. The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) was used to obtain patients'self-reported outcome. Clinical data and SF-36 scores were collected and analysed for the time period prior to and after the peak of the pandemic. In total, 60 patients (mean age 47.9 ± 15 years, 53.3 % male) were included. The majority presented with a pathogenic gene variant (63.3 %) associated with classic phenotype. At baseline, 66.7 % were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), and 21.7 % on chaperone therapy. Predominant organ manifestations were cardiac (42/60, 70.0 %) and neurological (39/60, 65.0 %). After paired comparison prior and post peak of the pandemic in 2020, all eight items of the SF-36 score showed a numeric decline. Three items presented with a intergroup difference: social functioning (72.5 ± 29.3 vs. 64.8 ± 29.3, <i>p</i> = 0.012), energy/fatigue (56.8 ± 21.7 vs. 48.3 ± 23.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and role limitations due to physical health (64.2 ± 42.0 vs. 51.1 ± 45.5, <i>p</i> = 0.007).Subgroup analysis (regarding gender, age, and treatment) revealed that especially male and older (≥50 years) patients with FD showed reductions in multiple categories of HR-QoL. The item \"energy/fatigue\" presented significant declines among all subgroups. The worldwide Covid19 pandemic had a persistent negative affect on self-reported HR-QoL in patients with FD, including both mental and physical aspects. It remains unclear to what extend the disease itself and accompanying circumstances including local and governmental actions and restrictions contributed to these deteriorations. Our findings stress the importance for meticulous and constant interdisciplinary care including psychosocial aspects in patients with chronic progressive diseases as well as the need for a change in mindset concerning future medical care including further progress in digitalisation and a strengthening of the remote health care sector by authorities."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, leading to reduced α-galactosidase (α-Gal A) activity. Current treatments, like enzyme replacement, have limitations affecting efficacy and patient outcomes. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools may offer the potential to develop therapeutic strategy via correcting GLA mutations. In this study, we diagnosed a female FD patient with a missense mutation in exon 1 of the GLA gene (c.146G > A, p.R49H). Bioinformatic predictions and biochemical analyses in GLA-knockout cells revealed that this mutation significantly reduced α-Gal A stability and activity, confirming its pathogenicity. To correct this, we used adenine base editing. The mutation, along with a nearby bystander A, was efficiently edited by the traditional N-terminal adenine base editor. To avoid unwanted bystander editing, we developed a series of domain-inlaid base editors with the aim of narrowing editing window. The most effective variant, with deaminase inserted between the 947th and 948th residues of the RUVC3 domain, was further optimized by modifying linker rigidity. These adjustments shifted the editing window, eliminating bystander editing. Our findings clarify the pathogenic nature of a novel GLA mutation and demonstrate the potential of a customized base editor for therapeutic application in FD."

    "abstract": "Infiltrative heart disease (InHD) is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances in the heart tissue, causing diastolic, less often systolic, dysfunction of the ventricle(s). Their classification still does not exist. In 2013, the MOGE(S) classification of cardiomyopathies was published, taking into account, along with the morphological and functional characteristics of the heart, damage to other organs, the presence of genetic mutations, acquired causes (e.g., myocardial inflammation, autoimmune diseases, storage diseases, amyloidosis), etc. By analogy with it we offer the MORAL-STAGE classification for InHD. It includes ten features: morphofunctional characteristics (M), organ damage (O), risk of cardiac death (R), age of clinical presentation, age of disease-specific therapy initiation (A), localization of the infiltrative process (inside or outside the cell, L), information about the functional class heart failure and stage of infiltrative heart disease (S), treatment (T), abnormal rhythm or conduction (A), genetic or familial nature of inheritance (G), etiology of the process (E). This article summarizes the cornerstones of the MORAL-STAGE classification and its clinical relevance. In addition, new issues are discussed that can be considered in future versions of the MORAL-STAGE classification."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is the most frequently occurring form of lysosomal disease in Japan, and is characterized by a wide variety of conditions. Primarily, the three major types of concerns associated with Fabry disease observed during adulthood that must be prevented are central nervous system, renal, and cardiac complications. Cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy, cardiac muscle fibrosis, and severe arrhythmia, are the most common mortality causes in patients with Fabry disease. To predict cardiac complications of Fabry disease, we extracted RNA from the venous blood of patients for cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), performed likelihood ratio tests for each RNA expression dataset obtained from individuals with and without cardiac complications, and analyzed the correlation between cardiac functional factors observed using magnetic resonance imaging data extracted using artificial intelligence algorithms and RNA expression. Our findings showed that CHN1 expression was significantly higher in male Fabry disease patients with cardiac complications and that it could be associated with many cardiac functional factors. <i>CHN1</i> encodes a GTPase-activating protein, chimerin 1, which is specific to the GTP-binding protein Rac (involved in oxidative stress generation and the promotion of myocardial fibrosis). Thus, CHN1 is a potential predictive biomarker of cardiac complications in Fabry disease; however, further studies are required to confirm this observation."

    "abstract": "Cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin (ATTR) remains an underdiagnosed cause of cardiomyopathy. As awareness of the disease grows and referrals for ATTR increase, clinicians are likely to encounter more atypical forms of the condition in clinical practice. Therefore, physicians and treating cardiologists should be aware of the full phenotypic spectrum of ATTR. The phenotypic manifestation of ATTR varies depending on the stage of the disease, the presence and type of TTR mutation and the patient's comorbidities. ATTR findings can be grouped into four major categories: clinical profile and cardiac phenotype, extra-cardiac findings, electrocardiogram and imaging findings, which cumulatively form the full phenomap of ATTR. Results from any diagnostic test for ATTR should be interpreted in light of the pre-test probability for the disease. Findings that suggest negative markers for ATTR can point towards other forms of amyloidosis (such as AL amyloidosis) or alternate causes of left ventricular hypertrophy, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or Fabry disease. The rising number of referrals for ATTR cardiomyopathy presents a challenge in daily clinical practice. To prevent an increase in false-positive diagnostic test results, an ATTR phenomap can serve as a valuable tool for guiding diagnostic assessments, interpreting test outcomes and prioritizing appropriate referrals for ATTR screening."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, leading to deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various tissues, causing multi-systemic manifestations. This case report presents a rare instance of Fabry disease in a 32-year-old female patient, highlighting the unique clinical presentation with multisystem involvement. Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that primarily affects males, while females are often considered asymptomatic carriers. Heterozygous females can exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, varying from a complete absence of symptoms to the full expression of the disease. The patient presented with a complex array of symptoms, including progressive dyspnea, fever, headache, lower limb pain, and periorbital edema, accompanied by a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Laboratory investigations revealed severe anemia, elevated renal function parameters, and significant proteinuria. A renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Fabry disease, based on the characteristic histopathological findings of widespread glomerular and segmental tuft sclerosis, as well as podocyte enlargement with fine vacuolization. The patient was managed with a combination of sequential hemodialysis and diuretic therapy. This case is a rare and unique example of Fabry disease in a female patient, with symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, including the renal, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. It underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for Fabry disease, even in female patients, and the need for a comprehensive diagnostic approach to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Early recognition of this rare condition in females is crucial for the implementation of targeted therapies, such as enzyme replacement therapy and oral chaperone therapy, to prevent the progression of multi-organ damage."

    "abstract": "Engineering proteins with desired functions and biochemical properties is pivotal for biotechnology and drug discovery. While computational methods based on evolutionary information are reducing the experimental burden by designing targeted libraries of functional variants, they still have a low success rate when the desired protein has few or very remote homologous sequences. Here we propose an autoregressive model, called Temporal Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (TDVAE), which exploits the mathematical properties of the Dirichlet distribution and temporal convolution to efficiently learn high-order information from a functionally related, possibly remotely similar, set of sequences. TDVAE is highly accurate in predicting the effects of amino acid mutations, while being significantly 90% smaller than the other state-of-the-art models. We then use TDVAE to design variants of the human alpha galactosidase enzymes as potential treatment for Fabry disease. Our model builds a library of diverse variants which retain sequence, biochemical and structural properties of the wildtype protein, suggesting they could be suitable for enzyme replacement therapy. Taken together, our results show the importance of accurate sequence modelling and the potential of autoregressive models as protein engineering and analysis tools."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by galactosidase α (GLA) gene mutations, exhibits diverse clinical manifestations, and poses significant diagnostic challenges. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improved patient outcomes, pressing the need for reliable biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNA candidates as potential biomarkers for Fabry disease using the KingFisher™ automated isolation method and NanoString nCounter® miRNA detection assay. Clinical serum samples were collected from both healthy subjects and Fabry disease patients. RNA extraction from the samples was performed using the KingFisher™ automated isolation method with the MagMAX mirVanaTM kit or manually using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit. The subsequent NanoString nCounter® miRNA detection assay showed consistent performance and no correlation between RNA input concentration and raw count, ensuring reliable and reproducible results. Interestingly, the detection range and highly differential miRNA between the control and disease groups were found to be distinct depending on the isolation method employed. Nevertheless, enrichment analysis of miRNA-targeting genes consistently revealed significant associations with angiogenesis pathways in both isolation methods. Additionally, our investigation into the impact of enzyme replacement therapy on miRNA expression indicated that some differential miRNAs may be sensitive to treatment. Our study provides valuable insights to identify miRNA biomarkers for Fabry disease. While different isolation methods yielded various detection ranges and highly differential miRNAs, the consistent association with angiogenesis pathways suggests their significance in disease progression. These findings lay the groundwork for further investigations and validation studies, ultimately leading to the development of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to aid in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring for Fabry disease."

This study presents a review of ECG features attributable to various infiltrative cardiomyopathies and analyzes the prevalence and overlap of electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with adjudicated CHF. The study included 573 consecutive CHF patients without severe aortic stenosis, further stratified by LV hypertrophy (LVH) and preserved or decreased LV ejection fraction. Comprehensive ECG analysis revealed at least one ECG abnormality typically associated with infiltrative cardiomyopathies in 95% of patients, and more than one ECG abnormality in 70%. An average number of ECG abnormalities was 2.2 ± 1.2 per patient. There was substantial overlap in ECG abnormalities in individual patients, particularly those attributable to Fabry's disease and hemochromatosis (51.5%) or cardiac amyloidosis (46.1%), and hemochromatosis and cardiac amyloidosis (44.2%). Prevalence of various ECG abnormalities was similar across various patient demographics and co-morbidities, including LVH status and/or history of CAD which did not increase the number of ECG abnormalities (2.155 ± 1.238 vs. 2.228 ± 1.192 in patients without CAD history, p = 0.969). Patients with reduced LV ejection fraction had a higher prevalence of widened QRS and premature ventricular complexes. ECG abnormalities attributable to infiltrative cardiomyopathies are common in heart failure patients, with a significant overlap in findings classically attributed to various infiltrative cardiomyopathies. The presence of LVH and decreased LV ejection fraction do not significantly affect the prevalence of ECG abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a multi-organ disease, caused by mutations in the GLA gene and leading to a progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids due to enzymatic absence or malfunction of the encoded alpha-galactosidase A. Since pathomechanisms are not yet fully understood and available treatments are not efficient for all mutation types and tissues, further research is highly needed. This research involves many different model types, with significant effort towards the establishment of an in vivo model. However, these models did not replicate the variety of symptoms observed in patients. As an alternative strategy, patient-derived somatic cells as well as patient-independent cell lines were used to model specific aspects of the disease in vitro. Fabry disease patients present different phenotypes according to the mutation and the level of residual enzyme activity, pointing to the necessity of personalized disease modeling. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells, the derivation of a multitude of disease-affected cell types became possible, even in a patient-specific and mutation-specific manner. Only recently, three-dimensional Fabry disease models were established that even more closely resemble the native tissue of investigated organs and will bring research closer to the in vivo situation. This review provides an overview of human in vitro models and their achievements in unravelling the Fabry disease pathomechanism as well as in elucidating current and future treatment strategies."

Substrate deposition, associated with tissue damage in FD, also contributes to the emergence of a pro-inflammatory state presented by some patients. We investigated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of inflammation-associated genes in treated FD patients, as well as oxidative parameters. We found a decrease in the production of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in male FD patients and a normalization of redox status in male and female FD patients, once the levels of protein, lipid oxidation, and nitrite and nitrate content were like healthy individuals. Our results suggest that long-term ERT in men with FD contributes to the reduction of a pro-inflammatory scenario and a decrease of oxidative damage in patients, reflecting greater control throughout the disease and in the multisystemic changes characteristic of this disorder. These findings lead us to believe that long-term ERT can improve the redox status and protect these individuals against oxidative and nitrative stress, as well as the inflammatory process."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal condition that leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in various tissues, causing cellular dysfunction, tissue remodeling, progressive fibrosis, and organ failure. The disease results from a deficiency in the human α-galactosidase A enzyme, responsible for breaking down glycosphingolipids like globotriaosylceramide (GL-3 or Gb3) into galactose and dihexose ceramides. In individuals diagnosed with Fabry disease, treatment from 2 years of age onwards typically involves agalsidase beta, the normal recombinant form of the defective enzyme. Agalsidase beta from Biosidus has been developed as a biosimilar to Sanofi-Genzyme's Fabrazyme®. In the molecule's clinical journey, a phase I trial was designed to establish its similarity in terms of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity compared to the reference medication. The study was conducted on 24 healthy male volunteers, aged between 18 and 40 years. All volunteers received a single 1 mg/kg bw dose of Fabrazyme® or Biosidus Agalsidase beta by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 h. The 90 % confidence interval (CI) of the maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 h (AUC0-12 h) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) ratios fell within the accepted range of 80-125 %. No differences were detected in adverse effects or antibody induction. This indicates that Biosidus agalsidase beta meets the criteria for being considered similar to the reference formulation Sanofi Genzyme's Fabrazyme®."

    "abstract": "Patients with Fabry disease (FD) consider their quality of life to be significantly affected. The majority of studies evaluate the quality of life using quantitative measures and standardised scales that offer relevant information about experience with the disease in multiple aspects. The main objective of the research was to examine in depth the quality of life and unmet needs of patients diagnosed with FD in relation to their disease and treatment. A qualitative and transversal study was carried out in two stages: (a) nine semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients and one representative of the patient association, conducted individually by phone; (b) a focus group was set up with three patients diagnosed with FD and one relative. A deductive, thematic analysis approach was used for data coding and analysis. The analysis of the interviews revealed various relevant themes: experience with the disease, impact on daily activities, experience of the family and work environment, experience related to treatment and healthcare professionals, and unmet support needs. Diagnosis has a significant impact on both those suffering from the disease and on the family environment. The symptoms and evolution of the disease are highly variable among the patients interviewed and depend on the years diagnosed as well as the time taken to receive the diagnosis. The families of the interviewees have to go through an adjustment process in light of the significant psychological impact brought about by the disease. Patients show various unmet needs. The need mentioned most is to have more information, support, and understanding from people around them and society, improving empathy and raising awareness about the difficulties faced by people with FD while giving the disease visibility. A lack of social understanding is highlighted as one of the main challenges, as this does not only affect the emotional management of the disease but also has repercussions on working life and social relationships. It seems necessary to define possible strategies that help to improve the quality of life of patients and their experience with the disease. Some recommendations obtained from the study include: facilitate access to mental health professionals for patients and their families; improve training for specialists and coordination among them; and carry out actions to raise awareness of the disease that are aimed at the general public, the patients themselves, and the people around them."

Electron microscopy revealed myeloid bodies in some podocytes, which suggested the patient possibly coexistence with Fabry disease. The low activity of α-galactosidase A and one pathogenic heterozygous mutation (c.335G > Ap.Arg112His) in the α-galactosidase A gene confirmed the diagnosis of Fabry disease. This patient's son had the same gene mutation as his mother but without any symptoms at the time. Treatment with ramipril turned urine protein negative.

We describe the case of a 23-year-old FD patient who was admitted as an emergency transfer due to newly discovered severe aortic regurgitation and suspected aortic valve endocarditis with vegetations of high embolic potential.

The study included 48 patients with FD and 48 healthy controls matched for age and sex. According to the presence/absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the patients with FD were divided into an LVH + group and an LVH- group. Left ventricular blood pressure was estimated noninvasively according to echocardiographic valvular events and systolic pressure in the brachial artery. Left ventricular myocardial work parameters were acquired by echocardiographic pressure-strain loop analysis. The FD groups had a significantly lower global longitudinal strain (GLS), global work index, global work efficiency (GWE), global constructive work and higher global waste work than the control group (P < .05). Regional analysis showed that all segmental myocardial waste work increased and myocardial work efficiency decreased in the LVH + group than in the LVH- group (P < .05). Segmental longitudinal strain, myocardial work index, and myocardial constructive work were markedly lower in the basal and middle segments (P < .05) and preserved in the apical segments. Multivariate analysis revealed that GWE and GLS were significant related to LVH. Myocardial work analysis can be used to assess global and regional myocardial work in patients with FD. In this study, GLS and GWE were reduced in patients with FD and associated with the presence of LVH. Basal and middle myocardial work decreased in relation to the LVH, while apical myocardial work remained, which added value to explore the distribution of myocardial impairment."

There is a promising role for LLN dissection (LLND) to lower this risk, but this challenging procedure requires appropriate training. This study protocol describes a prospective evaluation of oncological outcomes after standardised treatment based on multidisciplinary training, thereby aiming for a 50% reduction in LLR rate. A prospective registration study will be opened in hospitals in which the involved multidisciplinary team members (radiologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons and pathologists) have received dedicated training to enhance knowledge and awareness of LLNs and in which standardised treatment including LLND has been implemented. Patients with rectal cancer and at least one enlarged LLN (short-axis ≥7.0 mm), or intermediate LLN (short-axis 5.0-6.9 mm) with at least one malignant feature on primary MRI, evaluated by a trained radiologist, are eligible. Patients will undergo neoadjuvant treatment by trained radiation oncologists, followed by TME surgery in combination with a minimally invasive, nerve-sparing LLND performed by trained surgeons. LLND specimens are evaluated by trained pathologists or grossing assistants. The primary outcome is LLR rate 3 years postoperatively. Secondary outcomes are morbidity, disease-free survival, overall survival and quality of life. To demonstrate a significant reduction in LLR rate from 13% (based on historical control data) to 6% after optimised treatment, 200 patients with enlarged LLNs are required.

    "abstract": "Despite different etiopathogenesis, Fabry Disease cardiomyopathy (FDc) and sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) share a similar hypertrophic phenotype, including anomalies of the mitral valve apparatus (AMVA). Some of these anomalies have also been described in the pre-hypertrophic stage of both diseases. This cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study aimed to: (i) compare AMVA between FDc and HCM with a similar degree of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), to add new insights into differential diagnosis; (ii) assess whether AMVA represent an early and progressive alteration in FDc; (iii) propose simple and potentially reproducible measurements of AMVA. This observational, retrospective study enrolled: (i) 80 Fabry patients, divided into three groups with increasing severity of cardiac phenotype (20 patients LVH-/normal T1, 20 patients LVH-/low T1 and 40 patients LVH+), and (ii) 40 patients with HCM. All patients underwent CMR. The LVH + FDc and the HCM groups were matched for age, sex, body surface area and left ventricular (LV) mass. The following AMVA were measured on cine images: papillary muscles (PMs) hypertrophy (maximal diameter (Dmax) of anterolateral (Al) and posteromedial (Pm) PM), apical displacement, anteriorization of Al PM and anterior mitral valve leaflet (AMVL) elongation. Reference values for defining AMVA were derived from a matched healthy control group (<i>n</i> = 40). Both HCM and FDc LVH + patients showed PMs hypertrophy, with a greater degree in the FDc LVH + group [Dmax Al PM 16 ± 3.4 vs. 15 ± 3.1 mm, <i>p</i> 0.017; Dmax Pm PM 14 ± 4.0 vs.12 mm (10.0-14.0), <i>p</i> 0.039] As compared to controls, both HCM and FDc LVH + patients showed PMs apical displacement (HCM 83% vs. healthy volunteers 8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001; FDc LVH + 65% vs. healthy volunteers 8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), with a greater prevalence in HCM. Anteriorization of Al PM was only evident in HCM (15 ± 6.2 vs. healthy controls 21 ± 5.3 mm, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Elongation of AMVL was detected both in HCM and FDc with LVH + (HCM 29 ± 4.0 vs. healthy volunteers 24 ± 2.9 mm, <i>p</i> < 0.001; FDc LVH + 27 ± 4.0 vs. healthy volunteers 24 ± 2.9 mm, <i>p</i> < 0.001) without significant differences between the two phenocopies. The prevalence of myocardial crypts was higher among HCM patients than in FDc LVH + patients (75% vs. 48%, <i>p</i> 0.012). we report greater PMs hypertrophy in FDc and a higher prevalence of PMs positional alterations (anterior and apical displacement) and myocardial crypts in HCM. All these AMVA became more pronounced with the progression of the FDc phenotype. We suggest the systematic inclusion of the analysis of AMVA by simple linear measurements on cine images in the CMR assessment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, to help in the differential diagnosis between HCM and FDc and to facilitate early detection of cardiac involvement in FDc."

    "title": "In Silico Modeling of Fabry Disease Pathophysiology for the Identification of Early Cellular Damage Biomarker Candidates.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease whose ultimate consequences are the accumulation of sphingolipids and subsequent inflammatory events, mainly at the endothelial level. The outcomes include different nervous system manifestations as well as multiple organ damage. Despite the availability of known biomarkers, early detection of FD remains a medical need. This study aimed to develop an in silico model based on machine learning to identify candidate vascular and nervous system proteins for early FD damage detection at the cellular level. A combined systems biology and machine learning approach was carried out considering molecular characteristics of FD to create a computational model of vascular and nervous system disease. A data science strategy was applied to identify risk classifiers by using 10 K-fold cross-validation. Further biological and clinical criteria were used to prioritize the most promising candidates, resulting in the identification of 36 biomarker candidates with classifier abilities, which are easily measurable in body fluids. Among them, we propose four candidates, CAMK2A, ILK, LMNA, and KHSRP, which have high classification capabilities according to our models (cross-validated accuracy ≥ 90%) and are related to the vascular and nervous systems. These biomarkers show promise as high-risk cellular and tissue damage indicators that are potentially applicable in clinical settings, although in vivo validation is still needed."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: The diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac involvement in Fabry disease constitutes an important challenge for clinicians caring for affected patients. Combining cardiac imaging with laboratory biomarkers appears most appropriate for longitudinal monitoring. Therefore, we examined the use of NT-proBNP and its association with imaging findings in patients with Fabry disease. <b>Methods</b>: We analysed cardiac MRI and echocardiography data, as well as laboratory results, from a single-centre prospective registry. <b>Results</b>: Repetitive follow-ups of 38 patients with Fabry disease, of whom 18 presented with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), revealed a correlation of NT-proBNP with left ventricular (LV) interventricular septal thickness, LV maximum wall thickness, LV and right ventricular (RV) mass index and trabecular mass in patients with LVH. Patients without LVH did not exhibit any tangible association between NT-proBNP and the mentioned parameters. Conversely, we could not detect an association of NT-proBNP with impairment of LV or RV ejection fraction or diastolic volume. <b>Conclusions</b>: NT-proBNP plays a pivotal role as a biomarker for cardiac involvement in patients with Fabry disease. Interestingly, in this specific population with mostly preserved ejection fraction, it seems to reflect ventricular hypertrophy rather than ventricular dysfunction or dilatation. While strong associations were found in hypertrophic patients, NT-proBNP's prognostic value appears limited in non- or pre-hypertrophic stages."

    "title": "Characterization of Fabry disease-associated lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> on mouse colonic ion transport and motility.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in α-galactosidase A leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) and subsequent increase in globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>) in different cells and organs, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI symptoms represent some of the earliest manifestations of FD and significantly impact quality of life. The origin of these symptoms is complex, and the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we sought to determine whether lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> contributes to the pathophysiology of GI symptoms associated with FD by examining its effects on mouse colonic ion transport and motility ex vivo using Ussing chambers and organ baths, respectively. Lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> significantly increased colonic baseline short-circuit current (<i>I</i><sub>sc</sub>). This increase in <i>I</i><sub>sc</sub> was insensitive to inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1, suggesting that the increase in <i>I</i><sub>sc</sub> is Cl<sup>-</sup> ion independent. This response was also insensitive to inhibition by the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin. In addition, pretreatment with lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> did not significantly influence subsequent responses to either veratridine or capsaicin implying that the response to lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> does not involve the enteric nervous system. In terms of colonic motility, lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> did not significantly influence colonic tone, spontaneous contractility, or cholinergic-induced contractions. These data suggest that lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> significantly influences ion transport in mouse colon, but that accumulation of Gb<sub>3</sub> may be a prerequisite for the more pronounced disturbances in GI physiology characteristic of FD.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Fabry disease-associated lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> significantly influences mouse colonic ion transport in a Cl<sup>-</sup> ion-independent manner."

    "title": "Oncological Aspects of Lysosomal Storage Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by the deficient activity of a lysosomal hydrolase or the lack of a functional membrane protein, transporter, activator, or other protein. Lysosomal enzymes break down macromolecular compounds, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis. Stored, undegraded materials have multiple effects on cells that lead to the activation of autophagy and apoptosis, including the toxic effects of lyso-lipids, the disruption of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion homeostasis, the secondary storage of macromolecular compounds, the activation of signal transduction, apoptosis, inflammatory processes, deficiencies of intermediate compounds, and many other pathways. Clinical observations have shown that carriers of potentially pathogenic variants in LSD-associated genes and patients affected with some LSDs are at a higher risk of cancer, although the results of studies on the frequency of oncological diseases in LSD patients are controversial. Cancer is found in individuals affected with Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Niemann-Pick type A and B diseases, alfa-mannosidosis, and sialidosis. Increased cancer prevalence has also been reported in carriers of a potentially pathogenic variant of an LSD gene, namely <i>CLN3</i>, <i>SGSH</i>, <i>GUSB</i>, <i>NEU1</i>, and, to a lesser extent, in other genes. In this review, LSDs in which oncological events can be observed are described."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Fabry disease (FD) on retinal microvasculature using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), arterial stiffness, and the resistive index (RI) of the central retinal artery (CRA) in early disease stages. Twenty-nine genetically confirmed FD patients and twenty-six healthy controls were enrolled. Vessel density (VD) values of the superficial, deep, and choriocapillaris plexuses (SCP, DCP, and CC) were measured via OCTA. CRA RI was studied using color Doppler and grayscale sonography, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed with the Complior method. CRA RI was significantly lower in the control group compared to the Fabry group (p < 0.001). Central VD was found to be significantly higher in the control group compared to the Fabry group in all the retinal layers (SCP (p < 0.001), DCP (p < 0.005), CC (p < 0.001)). PWV was significantly higher in the Fabry group than in the control group (p = 0.03). Fabry disease patients demonstrate elevated arterial stiffness, increased CRA RI, and diminished retinal microvascular density compared to healthy controls, indicating early ocular damage. Continuous monitoring and targeted screening for organ impairment are crucial in FD management. Identifying biomarkers for assessing ocular vascular involvement and treatment response is imperative. Further research is needed."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive diagnosis of disease stage in Fabry cardiomyopathy with multimodality imaging is pivotal when deciding on the appropriate time to initiate enzyme replacement therapy. However, this approach has not been well established. We enrolled 14 patients with Fabry disease. All patients were evaluated using echocardiography and contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and were divided into either an early-stage group without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH; wall thickness >12 mm) or late gadolinium enhancement (LGE; n=7; median age 37 years; 4 female), or an advanced-stage group with LVH and/or LGE (n=7; median age 66 years; 7 female). Strain data from echocardiography and T1 mapping on CMR were compared between the groups. In the advanced-stage group, all strain data were impaired. In the early-stage group, localized longitudinal strain in the basal posterolateral segment was already reduced but both localized and global circumferential strain remained preserved. On CMR analysis, global and localized native T1 shortening were observed in the early-stage group, but were pseudo-normalized in the advanced-stage group. In logistic regression analysis, localized circumferential strain had significant diagnostic value for differentiating between early- and advanced stage (P=0.037) and significantly improved the predictive power of the model containing localized native T1 in CMR. A combination of localized native T1 in CMR and echocardiographic strain parameters could be useful for staging Fabry cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder marked by alpha-galactosidase-A (α-Gal A) deficiency, caused by pathogenic mutations in the GLA gene, resulting in the accumulation of glycosphingolipids within lysosomes. The current screening test relies on measuring α-Gal A activity. However, this approach is limited to males. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a technique that can generate fingerprint spectra of a biofluid's molecular composition and has been successfully applied to screen numerous diseases. Herein, we investigate the discriminating vibration profile of plasma chemical bonds in patients with FD using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The Fabry disease group (n = 47) and the healthy control group (n = 52) recruited were age-matched (39.2 ± 16.9 and 36.7 ± 10.9 years, respectively), and females were predominant in both groups (59.6% and 65.4%, respectively). All patients had the classic phenotype (100%), and no late-onset phenotype was detected. A generated partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification model, independent of gender, allowed differentiation of samples from FD vs. control groups, reaching 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy harnessed to pattern recognition algorithms can distinguish between FD patients and healthy control participants, offering the potential of a fast and inexpensive screening test."

    "title": "Genetic principles related to neurocutaneous disorders.",
    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of genetics is critical to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of neurocutaneous disorders. Inheritance patterns can provide a key to the identification of different neurocutaneous disorders. Autosomal dominant disorders, like neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex, affect males and females equally and are typically seen in every generation of a pedigree due to pathogenic changes to one copy of a gene on a somatic chromosome. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, affect males and females equally but typically skip generations on pedigrees as there needs to be a pathogenic variant of the gene on each of the pair of somatic chromosomes. X-linked disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti and Fabry disease primarily affect males or affect them more severely, but in the case of incontinentia pigmenti, the condition is lethal in males and only females are noted to be affected. The pathogenic variant that is disease causing is on the X sex chromosome, of which females have two and males have one. Somatic mosaic disorders like Sturge Weber syndrome are due to pathogenic variants only in a subset of cells post-fertilization and are not present in gametes, and so are not passed on to the next generation. Conditions that are a result of germline mosaicism are usually identified as autosomal dominant conditions that have not been present in the family prior to a single child being affected, with suspicion strengthening if siblings are diagnosed with the same condition. Regardless of the suspected inheritance pattern, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of genetic testing, including family planning, discovery of consanguinity, disclosure to other potentially affected family members, and diagnostic uncertainty."

Their co-occurrence is extremely rare, never been reported before. Therefore, screening is crucial for early management, and families should seek genetic counseling for children showing unusual presentations. Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a rare condition, characterized by a lysosomal storage disorder affecting lipid storage. It manifests in two forms: classic (early-onset) and nonclassic (late-onset). Conversely, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) is a rare blood disorder caused by ineffective erythropoiesis, which results in the production of abnormal erythroblasts during the maturation of red blood cells, with CDA type II being the most frequent type. Both disorders have well-understood pathophysiologies, yet they are genetically distinct. AFD is inherited in an X-linked manner, whereas CDA type II follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Although both AFD and CDA type II have been reported separately in the literature. The co-existence for both AFD and CDA type II has not been reported. We describe a 10-year-old boy, with both which is believed to be the first documented case."

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a multifactorial condition with diverse etiologies, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and genetic disorders, often culminating in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A hallmark of CKD progression is kidney fibrosis, characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, for which there is currently no effective anti-fibrotic therapy. Recent literature highlights the critical role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling in CKD pathogenesis and renal fibrosis. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the latest findings on S1P metabolism and signaling in renal fibrosis and in specific CKDs, including diabetic nephropathy (DN), lupus nephritis (LN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Fabry disease (FD), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Emerging studies underscore the therapeutic potential of modulating S1P signaling with receptor modulators and inhibitors, such as fingolimod (FTY720) and more selective agents like ozanimod and cenerimod. Additionally, the current knowledge about the effects of established kidney protective therapies such as glucocorticoids and SGLT2 and ACE inhibitors on S1P signaling will be summarized. Furthermore, the review highlights the potential role of S1P as a biomarker for disease progression in CKD models, particularly in Fabry disease and diabetic nephropathy. Advanced technologies, including spatial transcriptomics, are further refining our understanding of S1P's role within specific kidney compartments. Collectively, these insights emphasize the need for continued research into S1P signaling pathways as promising targets for CKD treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a heterogenous group of inborn errors of metabolism due to lysosomal malfunction. LSDs affect 1 in 5000 live births, albeit every LSD itself has a low incidence. The most common LSDs are Fabry disease and Gaucher disease. The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules. Besides disturbance of cellular function, substrate accumulation may result in secondary toxic and/or inflammatory processes. For treatment of Fabry and Gaucher disease, several therapeutic approaches are approved including enzyme replacement therapy, chaperon therapy for Fabry disease and substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease."

BRIGHT (NCT03180840) was a phase III, open-label study in adults with Fabry disease, previously treated with agalsidase alfa or beta E2W for ≥3 years, who switched to 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa every 4 weeks (E4W) for 52 weeks. Primary objective assessed safety, including number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Thirty patients were enrolled (24 males); 23 previously received agalsidase beta. Pegunigalsidase alfa plasma concentrations remained above the lower limit of quantification throughout the 4-week dosing interval. Thirty-three of 182 TEAEs (in 9 patients) were considered treatment-related; all were mild/moderate. No patients developed de novo anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). In the efficacy analysis (n = 29), median (inter-quartile range) eGFR change from baseline over 52 weeks was -1.9 (-5.9; 1.8) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (n = 28; males [n = 22]: -2.4 [-5.2; 3.2]; females [n = 6]: -0.7 [-9.2; 2.0]). Overall, median eGFR slope was -1.9 (-8.3; 1.9) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year (ADA-negative [n = 20]: -1.2 [-6.4; 2.6]; ADA-positive [n = 9]: -8.4 [-11.6; -1.0]). Lyso-Gb3 concentrations were low and stable in females, with a slight increase in males (9/24 ADA-positive). The BRIGHT study results suggest that 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa E4W is tolerated well in stable adult patients with Fabry disease. Due to the low number of patients in this study, more research is needed to demonstrate the effects of pegunigalsidase alfa given E4W. Further evidence, outside of this clinical trial, should be factored in for physicians to prolong the biweekly ERT intervals to E4W. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Treatment with 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa every 4 weeks could offer a new treatment option for patients with Fabry disease."

We present a case of Fabry disease in female monozygotic twins exhibiting the CIH mutation and classical manifestations. A 61-year-old woman with a history of stroke, carotid artery occlusion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease was referred to the nephrology clinic for management of her chronic kidney disease. Her monozygotic twin sister also presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial flutter, carotid stenosis, and proteinuria. Clinical symptoms and a comprehensive family history strongly suggested the presence of Fabry disease. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of 5 variants within a complex intronic haplotype (CIH): c.-10 C > T, c.369 + 990 C > A, c.370 - 81_370-77delCAGCC, c.640-16 A > G, and c.1000-22 C > T.

Limited evidence is available on patient preferences for gene therapy in this population. In this study, we compare gene therapy-related risk tolerance between people affected by three lysosomal storage diseases currently faced with different therapeutic options and prognoses. A survey including the probabilistic threshold technique was developed in which respondents were asked to choose between gene therapy and the current standard of care. The attributes included to establish participants' risk tolerance were previously identified in focus groups of affected people or their representatives, namely: risk of mild side effects, severe side effects, the need for additional medication, and the likelihood of long-term effectiveness. The survey was distributed among people receiving outpatient care for type 1 Gaucher disease (good prognosis with current treatment options), Fabry disease (varying prognosis with current treatment options, XY-genotype on average more severely affected than XX), and parents representing people with severe forms of mucopolysaccharidosis type III A/B (poor prognosis, no disease-specific therapy available). A total of 85 surveys were completed (15 Gaucher disease respondents, 62 Fabry disease respondents (17 self-identifying male), eight parents of ten people with mucopolysaccharidosis type III). Disease groups with higher disease severity trended towards higher risk tolerance: Gaucher disease respondents were most cautious and predominantly preferred the current standard of care as opposed to MPS III representatives who were more risk tolerant. Respondents with Fabry disease were most heterogeneous in their risk tolerance, with male participants being more risk tolerant than female participants. Long-term effectiveness was the attribute in which respondents tolerated the least risk. People affected by a lysosomal storage disease associated with a poorer prognosis and less effective current treatment options trended towards more risk tolerance when choosing between gene therapy and the current standard of care. This study shows the importance of involvement of patient preferences before and during the development process of new treatment modalities such as gene therapy for rare diseases, to ensure that innovative therapies align with the wishes and needs of people affected by these diseases."

Neurofilament light chains (NfL) have emerged as a prime candidate for a body fluid biomarker reflecting neuro-axonal injury. We aimed to evaluate its addition to the diagnostic and monitoring armamentarium in FD. Serum NfL concentrations (sNfL) were measured in 50 people with FD (PwFD) and 30 healthy control subjects (HC) using the Simoa© technology, followed by calculation of Z-scores adjusted for age and body mass index. In addition, clinical disease severity in PwFD was measured using the FOS-MSSI (Fabry outcome study - Mainz severity score index), which comprises clinical and paraclinical parameters. PwFD show elevated sNfL Z-scores compared to HC (PwFD: 1.12 [SD 1.5], HC: 0.01 [SD 1.2], p < 0.001). In PwFD, males showed higher sNfL Z-scores than females (1.75 [SD 1.5] vs. 0.73 [SD 1.4]). Importantly, sNfL Z-scores were increased in PwFD with ischemic white matter lesions of the CNS (1.5, SD 2.2 vs. 0.5, SD 2.9, p = 0.03). In our small cohort, sNfL Z-scores correlated fairly with FOS-MSSI (Kendall's-Tau [τ] = 0.25, p = 0.01), and, interestingly with serum creatinine (τ = 0.28, p = 0.005) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, τ =-0.28, p = 0.005). Based on these exploratory results, sNfL might provide value as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in FD, possibly reflecting cerebrovascular injury. Additionally, the correlation of sNfL with renal function warrants further investigation."

This retrospective monocentric study enrolled 14 patients (M/F 1/1, median age 46 [37-63] years, range 31-72 years) newly diagnosed with FD between January 2016 and July 2023 who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) image at the time of diagnosis and 42 matched controls. In all subjects, data about bone mineral density (BMD) and lumbar spine TBS were collected and total calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH) vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated. In subjects with FD, globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), 24-hour proteinuria and albumin-creatinine ratio were also assessed. Patients with FD presented significantly lower lumbar spine TBS (1.29 [1.22-1.38] vs. 1.42 [1.39-1.47], p < 0.001) and lower lumbar spine BMD (0.916 ± 0.166 vs. 1.031 ± 0.125 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.008) compared to controls; moreover, FD was shown to be an independent risk factor for both low lumbar spine TBS (β = -0.118, p < 0.001) and BMD (β = -0.115, p = 0.009). No differences were found in serum calcium, ALP, 25(OH) vitamin D and eGFR in both groups, but FD patients had significantly higher PTH levels compared to controls (p = 0.016). Finally, 8 patients with FD presented either moderately or severely increased albuminuria and only 2 patients presented normal lyso-Gb3 levels. Patients affected by FD present significantly lower lumbar spine TBS and BMD compared to controls. Our findings strongly support the importance of carrying out a thorough evaluation of bone status in all patients affected by FD at baseline."

The consensus emphasizes the importance of proactive data collection in dialysis units and outpatient follow-ups to enhance FD detection and management. The screening algorithm recommends incorporating FD screening into the diagnostic process for CKD patients, regardless of age. Priority is given to patients with a family history of FD, early stroke history, or classical FD symptoms. Comprehensive screening is also advised for CKD patients without obvious classical symptoms. Screening protocols for males include measuring α-galactosidase A enzyme activity, with reduced activity leading to further tests such as lyso-Gb3 level quantification and genetic analysis. For females, the protocol involves evaluating lyso-Gb3 plasma levels and genetic testing. FD, though often underestimated, is more prevalent than recognized and necessitates a multidisciplinary approach for timely diagnosis. Enhancing awareness and adopting a comprehensive approach are essential for improving patient outcomes."

    "title": "A fast all-optical 3D photoacoustic scanner for clinical vascular imaging.",
    "abstract": "The clinical assessment of microvascular pathologies (in diabetes and in inflammatory skin diseases, for example) requires the visualization of superficial vascular anatomy. Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) scanners based on an all-optical Fabry-Perot ultrasound sensor can provide highly detailed 3D microvascular images, but minutes-long acquisition times have precluded their clinical use. Here we show that scan times can be reduced to a few seconds and even hundreds of milliseconds by parallelizing the optical architecture of the sensor readout, by using excitation lasers with high pulse-repetition frequencies and by exploiting compressed sensing. A PAT scanner with such fast acquisition minimizes motion-related artefacts and allows for the volumetric visualization of individual arterioles, venules, venous valves and millimetre-scale arteries and veins to depths approaching 15 mm, as well as for dynamic 3D images of time-varying tissue perfusion and other haemodynamic events. In exploratory case studies, we used the scanner to visualize and quantify microvascular changes associated with peripheral vascular disease, skin inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis. Fast all-optical PAT may prove useful in cardiovascular medicine, oncology, dermatology and rheumatology."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of Fabry disease (FD) with genetic variants of unknown significance (VUSs) is relatively difficult. We explored patients with novel VUS variants and concomitant immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) to improve the understanding of VUS. The study retrospectively investigated patients with genetically confirmed FD. Probands with VUS were selected from the database of FD patients who underwent genetic analysis. Demographic, clinicopathological, and laboratory data from probands and family members were collected and analyzed. Fourteen probands and their family members were included in the study. The probands were divided into group 1 (patients with VUS, n = 5) and group 2 (patients with pathologic/likely pathologic variants, n = 9). The group 1 included 2 missense mutations and 1 deletion mutation, while the group 2 included 6 missense mutations and 2 deletion mutations. There were no significant differences in gender, age, serum creatinine, eGFR, and proteinuria between the two groups. IgA deposition with myeloid bodies was found in all VUS patients. The cardiac involvement in group 2 was more severe than that in group 1. Seven families performed the pedigree analysis, and after the comprehensive evaluation, two GLA variants (c.479C&gt;A, p.Ala160Asp; c.1032-1058 del, p.Ser345_Met353del) were upgraded from VUS to the likely pathogenic. The clinical manifestations of FD are heterogeneous. FD often coexists with nephrotic disorders, such as IgAN and MCD. Comprehensive evaluation, especially tissue-specific biopsy, is necessary for patients with GLA-VUSs. Two GLA variants (c.479C&gt;A, p.Ala160Asp; c.1032-1058 del, p.Ser345_Met353del) were upgraded from VUS to the likely pathogenic after the comprehensive evaluation."

    "title": "Biochemical Amenability in Fabry Patients Under Chaperone Therapy-How and When to Test?",
    "abstract": "Current recommendations for Fabry disease include α-galactosidase A (AGAL) activity measurements to assess the biochemical response in migalastat-treated patients. Owing to contradictory data from laboratories, we aimed to analyze why AGAL activity measures from dried blood spots (DBS) often fail to detect migalastat-mediated enzymatic activity increases in treated patients. 43 patients with 58 visits under migalastat were consecutively recruited. Enzymatic AGAL activities were measured from DBS and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Migalastat concentrations in sera were determined using modified serum-mediated inhibition assays to assess C<sub>max</sub> and serum half-life. Results were set in relation to the time of last migalastat intake and blood sampling to assess an optimal timepoint for AGAL activity measures. DBS-based AGAL activity measurements of 21 (42.0%) amenable patients were below the limit of detection. Serum samples from migalastat-treated patients showed significant AGAL inhibition, depending on the time between migalastat intake and blood sampling (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.8140, p < 0.0001). Migalastat concentrations were determined in serum samples confirming a C<sub>max</sub> at 3 h and a serum half-life of 4 h. At 24 h after intake, migalastat clearance was significantly associated with renal function (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.3135, p = 0.0102). Enzymatic AGAL activities were higher in samples from DBS and PBMCs 24 h after migalastat intake (both p < 0.05). The optimal time for enzymatic AGAL activity measurement in migalastat-treated patients appears to be 24 h after the last migalastat intake. Since migalastat is a competitive inhibitor of AGAL, enzymatic AGAL activity measurements should be better performed from PBMCs to reduce migalastat-mediated interferences."

    "abstract": "Numerous prevalence studies on Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) have been conducted in dialysis populations across the world with variable and controversial results. The FABRYDIAL study aimed to estimate the prevalence of FD in patients aged 18 to 74 years on chronic dialysis in France. This cross-sectional study was conducted in patients undergoing dialysis. One hundred and twenty-four dialysis centers participated. Patients with proven causes of nephropathy unrelated to FD were excluded. Alpha-galactosidase A activity was assayed in men, and both α-galactosidase A and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> were assayed in women from dried blood spots. <i>GLA</i> gene sequencing was performed in case of abnormal values. If a variant was identified, a diagnosis validation committee was consulted for adjudication. Among the 6032 targeted patients, 3088 were included (73.6% of the eligible patients). Biochemical results were available for 2815 (1721 men and 1094 women). A genetic variant of <i>GLA</i> was identified in five patients: a benign c.937G>T/p.(Asp313Tyr) variant in two individuals, a likely benign c.427G>A/(p.Ala143Thr) variant, a likely benign c.416A>G/(p.Asn139Ser) variant, and a pathogenic c.1185dupG/p.Phe396Glyfs variant. Among the screened patients, the prevalence was 0.058% [0.010;0.328] in males, 0% [0.000;0.350] in females, and 0.035% [0.006;0.201] when both genders were pooled. Among all patients aged 18-74 years undergoing dialysis without a previously known cause of nephropathy unlinked to FD, the prevalence was 0.028% [0.006;0.121]. The prevalence of FD in a cohort of French dialysis patients was low. However, considering the prognostic impact of earlier diagnosis, signs of FD should be sought in patients with nephropathies of uncertain etiology."

Case/family description: A 52-year-old woman presented with new-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. Echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular wall thickening (14 mm) and mild diastolic dysfunction. She was the second of three siblings born to unrelated parents, both of whom died from malignancies. Family screening identified brothers, one affected 55-year-old with hypertension and asthma and one unaffected 47-year-old. The 15-year-old son of the proband complained of exercise-induced burning feet acral pain his electrocardiogram showed a short PR interval and signs of early hypertrophy. Endomyocardial biopsies of the proband and the affected sibling demonstrated substrate accumulation (globotriaosylceramide). The anti-α-galactosidase-A immunostain showed a total loss of the enzyme in the hemizygous male and a mosaic pattern in the heterozygous female. The next-generation sequencing short-read multigene panel identified the c.547+3A>G variant in the <i>GLA</i> gene and excluded variants in other genes; Oxford-Nanopore long-read sequencing excluded known pathogenic deep intronic variants. A Multiplex-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification assay excluded copy number variations. Based on the variant-level and gene-level ACMG criteria, the variant was classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance or Likely Benign using different bioinformatic tools. By adding case-level functional data (endomyocardial biopsy, PS3_VeryStrong) and familial data (segregation of genotype with phenotype, PP2_Moderate), the variant was classified as Likely Pathogenic/Pathogenic. ACMG case-level data can unambiguously resolve uncertain interpretations of <i>GLA</i> variants."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity and the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in tissues, which leads to multiorgan damage. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and the T1 mapping technique are essential tools for the assessment of AFD cardiac involvement. Moreover, the T1 mapping technique has proved to be a successful non-invasive method for the early detection of patients most at risk for kidney disease. We evaluated the application of MRI in patients with AFD to assess renal involvement. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 19 patients (Group A) with histologically proven AFD who underwent routine CMR examinations for the evaluation of cardiac involvement, selecting specific sequences that also showed the left kidney, compared to a control population (Group B, 19 patients) without kidney disease. A Spearman's rank-order correlation was run to assess the relationship between the T1 mapping values of the heart and kidney in Group A and between the kidneys of Groups A and B. There was a positive correlation between the heart and kidney T1 values in Group A (rho = 0.32). More interestingly, we observed a negative correlation between the kidney values of both groups (Group A mean 1284 ± 137 ms, Group B mean 1073 ± 57 ms, rho = -0.38), which is probably related to the presence of microvascular damage and infiltrates in the kidneys of AFD patients. To our knowledge, these results are the first to highlight the key value of T1 mapping in assessing pathological changes and aiding in the non-invasive diagnosis of renal involvement in AFD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disease that is caused by deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can detect cardiac sphingolipid accumulation using native T1 mapping. The kidneys are often visible in cardiac CMR native T1 maps; however, it is currently unknown if the maps can be used to detect sphingolipid accumulation in the kidneys of FD patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate if cardiac-dedicated native T1 maps can be used to detect sphingolipid accumulation in the kidneys. FD patients (n = 18, 41 ± 10 years, 44% (8/18) male) and healthy subjects (n = 38, 41 ± 16 years, 47% (18/38) male) were retrospectively enrolled. Native T1 maps were acquired at 1.5T using modified Look-Locker inversion recovery research sequences. Native T1 values were measured by manually delineating regions of interest (ROI) in the renal cortex, renal medulla, heart, spleen, blood, and liver. Endo- and epicardial borders were delineated in the myocardium and averaged across all slices. Blood ROIs were placed in the left ventricular blood pool in the midventricular slice. There were no differences in native T1 between the FD patients and the healthy subjects in the renal cortex (1034 ± 88 ms vs 1056 ± 59 ms, p = 0.29), blood (1614 ± 111 ms vs 1576 ± 100 ms, p = 0.22), spleen (1143 ± 45 ms vs 1132 ± 70 ms, p = 0.54), or liver (568 ± 49 ms vs 557 ± 47 ms, p = 0.41). Native myocardial T1 was lower in FD patients compared to healthy subjects (951 ± 79 vs 1006 ± 38, p<0.01), and higher in the renal medulla (1635 ± 144 vs 1514 ± 81, p<0.01). Compared to healthy subjects, patients with FD and cardiac involvement showed no differences in native T1 of the renal cortex. FD patients had higher native T1 in the renal medulla, which is not totally explained by differences in blood native T1 but may reflect a hyperfiltration state in the development of renal failure. The findings suggest that sphingolipid accumulation in the renal cortex in FD patients could not be detected with cardiac-dedicated research native T1 maps."

Fabry disease is a recognized cause of ischemic stroke in young patients, and although disease-modifying treatments are available, further evidence is needed to confirm their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of ischemic strokes. This study aimed to identify undiagnosed Fabry disease in young adult patients with ischemic stroke in a Taiwanese cohort. This multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolled patients aged 20-55 years who had experienced an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 10 days, from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020. Screening for Fabry disease was performed using a dry blood test to measure α-galactosidase activity in male patients and blood globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) levels in female patients. For patients with positive screen results, genetic diagnosis of Fabry disease was pursued through Sanger sequencing of the <i>GLA</i> gene, covering all exons and a segment of intron 4. A total of 977 patients (659 male, 68%) were enrolled from seven hospitals across Taiwan. Four patients (0.4%, all male) had positive screening results, and two patients (0.2%) were genetically diagnosed with Fabry disease. Case 1 had the <i>GLA</i> c.658C>T mutation and experienced ischemic stroke in the bilateral occipital regions. Case 2 had the <i>GLA</i> c.640-801G>A mutation and experienced an ischemic stroke in the left superficial watershed area. The prevalence of undiagnosed Fabry disease in this cohort of Taiwanese young adults with ischemic stroke or TIA was 0.3% among the young male population. Understanding the prevalence of undiagnosed Fabry disease in young adults with ischemic stroke could help shape future Fabry disease screening policies.

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by dysfunction of the lysosomal system, with subsequent progressive accumulation of macromolecules, activation of inflammatory response, and cell death. Neurologic damage is almost always present, and it is usually degenerative. White matter (WM) involvement may be primary or secondary. Diseases with primary WM involvement are leukodystrophies, demyelinating (Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy), and hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (free sialic acid storage disease, fucosidosis, and mucolipidosis type IV). LSDs with secondary WM involvement are classified as leukoencephalopathies and include gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), ceroid neuronal lipofuscinosis, multiple sulfatase deficiency, alpha-mannosidosis, Pompe disease, and Fabry disease. Neurologic manifestations may overlap among LSDs and include developmental delays, motor, cognitive and speech impairments, seizures, visual failure, ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. Most of LSDs are typically present in early or late infancy, but juvenile and adult forms also exist and are associated with predominantly neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. The outcome of these disorders is generally poor and specific treatments (enzyme replacement therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or gene therapy) are only available in a small number of them."

    "abstract": "Fabry's disease, also known as Anderson-Fabry Disease (AFD), is caused by mutations in the α galactosidase A (α GalA) gene found on the X chromosome. This condition results in an accumulation of sphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in cells throughout the body. The main effects of Fabry disease typically involve heart, kidney, and nervous system complications. A common cardiac dysfunction is left ventricular hypertrophy. In this case study, we share findings about cardiomyopathy resulting from Fabry disease to explain how this condition impacts the heart and the importance of a biopsy in making a diagnosis. A 57-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease likely attributed to hypertension was evaluated for a kidney transplant. An echocardiogram revealed severe ventricular hypertrophy. The clinical team ordered blood levels of alpha-galactosidase, globotriaosylceramide, and globotriaosylsphingosine enzymes, which demonstrated significant deficiency. Consequently, a genetic test along with an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was ordered. Under microscopy using hematoxylin and eosin stain (H/E) and periodic acid Schiff stain (PAS), myocyte vacuolization was observed, which remained unchanged when diastase was added. Electron microscopy revealed inclusion bodies described as myeloid and curvilinear bodies within cells, interstitial cells, and cardiomyocytes. Diagnosing Fabry disease can be challenging, as it may be confused with other medical conditions. Our case study showed how EMB played a role in diagnosing the disease and guiding proper treatment."

Antecedent screening studies worldwide have shown inconsistent prevalence in the hemodialysis population. We conducted this study to screen for Fabry disease in patients undergoing dialysis at a tertiary care hospital. All patients undergoing dialysis were screened with a gal assay using dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper using the fluorescence method. Patients with positive DBS test results were further tested for underlying mutations. A total of 112 patients (64.3% males and 35.7% females) on dialysis were screened. Nineteen patients (13 males and 6 females) were found to have low enzyme activity on DBS. Further mutation analysis confirmed that one female patient had Fabry disease. The mutation detected was a heterozygous missense variation in exon 7 of the GLA gene, which resulted in the amino acid substitution of histidine for arginine at codon 363 (p.Arg363His). Subsequent screening of the family members revealed that the son of the patient was asymptomatic and carried the same genotypic mutation. Genetic counseling was performed, and enzyme replacement therapy was offered to both patients. Fabry disease remains underdiagnosed, especially in high-risk populations such as those undergoing dialysis. DBS is a convenient and effective screening tool for Fabry disease. Facilities should be augmented for similar screening studies in the dialysis population."

In classic phenotype patients, α-galactosidase A activity is absent or severely reduced, resulting in a more progressive disease course with multi-systemic involvement. Conversely, late-onset phenotype, often with missense variants (e.g., IVS4+919G>A) in Taiwan, may present with a more chronic clinical course with predominant cardiac involvement (cardiac subtype), as they tend to have residual enzyme activity, remaining asymptomatic or clinically silent during childhood and adolescence. In either form, cardiac hypertrophy remains the most common feature of cardiac involvement, potentially leading to myocardial fibrosis, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Diagnosis is established through α-galactosidase enzyme activity assessment or biomarker analyisis (globotriaosylsphingosine, Lyso-Gb3), advanced imaging modalities (echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), and genotyping to differentiate FD from other cardiomyopathy. Successful therapeutic response relies on early recognition and by disease awareness from typical features in classic phenotype and cardiac red flags in cardiac variants for timely therapeutic interventions. Recent advances in pharmacological approach including enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase alfa or beta), oral chaperone therapy (migalastat), and substrate reduction therapy (venglustat) aim to prevent from irreversible organ damage. Genotype- and gender-based monitoring of treatment effects through biomarker (Lyso-Gb3), renal assessment, and cardiac responses using advanced imaging modalities are key steps to optimizing patient care in FD."

The goal of this ABM was to discuss current unmet needs in the management of Fabry patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In the first ABM, experts opined on the best practices in the diagnosis, screening, and management of FD for healthcare professionals. These opinions on the management of FD relied on data from research and expert clinical judgments. In the second ABM, the same panel discussed different aspects of FD diagnosis, treatment, and management in the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The experts discussed the stigma associated with FD, patient awareness and knowledge, genetic screening, biomarkers, and home infusion therapy.

LGE quantifications were done using gray-scale thresholds of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 standard deviations (SD) above the mean signal intensity of the remote myocardium, the full width at half maximum method (FWHM), visual assessment with threshold (VAT) and the fully manual method (MM). <b>Results</b>: The mean amount of fibrosis varied between quantification techniques from 36 ± 19 at 2SD to 2 ± 2 g using the FWHM (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Intraobserver reliability was excellent for most methods, except for the FWHM which was good (ICC 0.84; all <i>p</i> < 0.05).

The phenotype of FD is highly variable, with distinctive disease features and course in classical male patients but more diverse and often nonspecific features in non-classical and female patients. FD-specific therapies have been available for approximately two decades, yet establishing robust evidence for long-term effectiveness remains challenging. This review aims to identify the factors contributing to this lack of robust evidence for the treatment of FD with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (agalsidase-alfa and -beta and pegunigalsidase alfa) and chaperone therapy (migalastat). Major factors that have been identified are study population heterogeneity (concerning sex, age, phenotype, disease stage) and differences in study design (control groups, outcomes assessed), as well as the short duration of studies. To address these challenges, we advocate for patient matching to improve control group compatibility in future FD therapy studies. We recommend international collaboration and harmonization, facilitated by an independent FD registry. We propose a stepwise approach for evaluating the effectiveness of novel treatments, including recommendations for surrogate outcomes and required study duration."

This review focuses on the critical function of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling in CKD, specifically how it influences both protective and pathogenic processes in the kidney. cAMP, a critical secondary messenger, controls a variety of cellular functions, including transcription, metabolism, mitochondrial homeostasis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Its compartmentalization inside cellular microdomains ensures accurate signaling. In kidney physiology, cAMP is required for hormone-regulated activities, particularly in the collecting duct, where it promotes water reabsorption through vasopressin signaling. Several illnesses, including Fabry disease, renal cell carcinoma, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, Bartter syndrome, Liddle syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and renal tubular acidosis, have been linked to dysfunction in the cAMP system. Both cAMP analogs and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have the potential to improve kidney function and reduce kidney damage.

    "abstract": "Although the optimal approach is debated, systematic genetic screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is recommended. The performance of this approach was tested in GEREMY, a HCM prospective observational French register. Screening was based on a 12-gene panel, including the Fabry disease (GLA) and the transthyretin (TTR) genes. In case of a negative result and according to the clinical profile, 17-80 gene panels of were used. A 748 adult cohort was examined: 68.9 % male, 54.6 ± 18.1 years, 27.5 % with a HCM family history, maximal wall thickness 19.1 ± 4.8 mm. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 296 (39.6 %) patients, localized 1) in sarcomeric genes in 233, most frequently MYBPC3 (150) and MYH7 (42), with 24 identified only by large panels, with multiple variants in 8 patients and 2) in non-sarcomeric genes in 63, identified only with large panels in 26, predominantly TTR (26) and GLA(9), representing 8.8 % and 3.0 % of positive studies, respectively. Performance was 57.1 % before 40 years and 68.6 % in case of FH (vs otherwise 28.7 % and 26.1 % respectively, p < 0.001). In patients with a negative study, 148 had variants of unknown significance and 95 had senile or AL amyloidosis. Systematic genetic screening with a limited panel showed good performance, with diagnosis of Fabry disease (∼1 %) and hereditary TTR amyloidosis (∼3.5 %). Larger targeted panels were conclusive in 35.3 % of patients, of which 12 % had a negative initial approach."

    "title": "Comparative study on incorporation of three recombinant human α-galactosidase A drugs (agalsidases) into cultured fibroblasts and organs/tissues of Fabry mice.",
    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) drugs (agalsidases) has been successfully used for treatment of Fabry disease, and three kinds of agalsidases are now available in Japan. To compare the biochemical characteristics of these drugs, especially focusing on their incorporation into cultured fibroblasts and organs/tissues of Fabry mice, we performed in vitro, cell, and animal experiments. The results revealed that there were no differences in the kinetic parameters and enzyme activity between these agalsidases. But their affinity for domain 9 of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), which exists in various cells, was higher in the order: agalsidase beta biosimilar 1 (agalsidase beta BS) > agalsidase beta > agalsidase alfa, which almost coincided with the experimental results regarding the efficiency of their incorporation into cultured fibroblasts derived from a Fabry mouse. The results of animal experiments using Fabry mice revealed that the incorporation of the agalsidases into the kidneys and heart, where CI-M6PRs are widely distributed, was efficient in the order: agalsidase beta/agalsidase beta BS > agalsidase alfa, which reflected the degree of reduction of glycosphingolipids accumulated in the organs/tissues. On the other hand, no differences in the efficiency of their uptake or reduction of the accumulated substances were observed in the liver, probably due to asialoglycoprotein receptors expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. This information will be useful for making a suitable ERT plan for individual Fabry patients with various backgrounds and for developing new ERT drugs in the future."

    "title": "Drug-induced liver injury related to gene therapy: A new challenge to be managed.",
    "abstract": "Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the expression of inflammatory cytokines (ICs) in Fabry disease (FD), the correlation between ICs and FD phenotypes, and the impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on IC expression. We recruited 67 FD patients and 44 healthy controls (HCs) and detected concentrations of the following ICs: interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12P70, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and TNF-β. We also analyzed the impact of ERT on IC expression in FD patients and the relationship between IC expression and sex, genotype, phenotype, disease burden, and biomarkers. Most ICs were significantly higher in FD patients than in HCs. A number of ICs were positively correlated with clinical aspects, including disease burden (Mainz Severity Score Index [MSSI]) and cardiac and renal markers. IL-8 was higher in the high MSSI (P-adj=0.026*) than in the low MSSI. ICs were upregulated in FD patients, indicating the role of the innate immune process in FD etiology. ERT ameliorated FD-related inflammatory activation, at least to some extent. IC expression was positively correlated with disease burden and clinical markers in FD. Our findings indicated that the inflammatory pathway may be a promising therapeutic target for FD."

    "title": "Screening for Fabry disease in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy in China: A multicentre and prospective study.",
    "abstract": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is frequently detected via echocardiography in individuals with Fabry disease (FD), sometimes leading to confusion with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of other aetiologies. Considering this diagnosis challenge, FD should be included in the list of differential diagnosis for patients presenting with LVH. To address this concern, we conducted a prospective screening study in China, using dried blood spot (DBS) testing, to evaluate patients with unexplained LVH. Our study was designed as a nationwide, multicentre prospective investigation. A total of 1015 patients from 55 different centres who were diagnosed with LVH by echocardiography were screened in the study from September 2022 to December 2023. Demographic information, biochemistry data, echocardiography parameters and clinical observations were meticulously collected from all participants. The DBS method was used to assess α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in males and both α-Gal A and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) levels in females. The final screening population included 906 patients (589 males, 65%) with LVH, characterized by a mean maximal myocardial thickness of 14.8 ± 4.6 mm and an average age of 56.9 ± 17.2 years. In total, 43 patients (38 males, 5 females) exhibited low α-Gal A activity measurement (<2.2 μmol/L), while 21 patients (10 males, 11 females) presented low α-Gal A activity or elevated lyso-Gb3 levels (>1.1 ng/mL). Among these patients, eight individuals (7 males and 1 female) were genetically confirmed to harbour pathogenic GLA mutations, resulting in a total prevalence of 0.88%. Compared with patients without FD, patients with FD tended to have proteinuria (75% vs. 21.2%, P = 0.001), family history of HCM (37.5% vs. 2.3%, P < 0.01) and neuropathic pain (37.5% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.01) but lower systolic blood pressure (118.5 ± 12.5 vs. 143.3 ± 29.3 mmHg, P = 0.017). Five mutations were previously recognized as associated with FD while the remaining two, p.Asp313Val (c.938A>T) and c.547+3A>G, were deemed potentially pathogenic. Subsequent familial validation post-diagnosis identified an additional 14 confirmed cases. This pioneering screening study for FD among Chinese patients with unexplained LVH using DBS measurement, revealed an FD detection rate of 0.88%. Our findings confirmed that the combined measurement of lyso-Gb3 and α-Gal A activity is beneficial for primary screening of FD in patients with LVH. Given the availability of efficacious therapies and the value of cascade screening in extended families, early detection of FD in LVH patients is clinically important."

    "title": "Chronic Cough as the First Clinical Sign of Fabry Disease: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which lead to a deficiency of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. Pulmonary involvement is one of the possible manifestations of FD, but it is often overlooked and is rarely the only clinical presentation. Chronic cough is an uncommon and nonspecific symptom of pulmonary involvement in FD. Here, we report a case of a 46-year-old non-smoker, Caucasian male who presented to a general practitioner with chronic cough without a significant medical history. The patient was referred to our hospital after routine blood tests revealed elevated creatinine levels. As his cousin had end-stage chronic kidney disease due to FD, we performed a fluorometric assay of the alpha-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spots, which showed abnormal results. Eventually, genetic testing revealed a mutation in the GLA gene. As respiratory symptoms persisted during hospitalization, spirometry was performed, revealing an obstructive pattern. Furthermore, bronchoscopy showed nonspecific bronchial inflammation. Additionally, end-stage renal disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were diagnosed. The patient was put on enzyme replacement therapy, and underwent kidney transplantation. Despite all these procedures, we did not observe any improvement in his cough. This case highlights that chronic cough may be an important clue for pulmonary involvement in FD and should prompt further evaluation in patients with other features suggestive of FD. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for improving the outcome and quality of life in patients with FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) deficiency. Reduced or absent enzyme activity causes progressive lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-Gb3) in various cells throughout the body to trigger inflammation and fibrosis. We present the first familial case of Fabry Disease in North Macedonia identified based on clinical manifestations and confirmed through enzyme, biomarker, and genetic tests. The index case in the family was a 45-year-old male undergoing hemodialysis therapy. He has had chronic burning uncontrolled limb pain since childhood, intermittent abdominal cramps, anhidrosis, and hypertension. The constellation of clinical presentations accompanied by similar symptoms in close family members prompted the enzyme, biomarker, and genetic analyses for Fabry disease. Genetic testing identified a known pathogenic <i>GLA</i> missense variant c.443G>A or p.(Ser148Asn) in the hemizygous state. Subsequent family studies allowed identification of another hemizygous male and five heterozygous female carriers affected by this X-linked disorder. We report identification of the first familial case of Fabry disease in North Macedonia and describe the phenotype associated with the Ser148Asn <i>GLA</i> variant. Greater awareness of this rare disease linked to continuous medical education is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment."

    "title": "Relationship between Capillaroscopic Architectural Patterns and Different Variant Subgroups in Fabry Disease: Analysis of Cases from a Multidisciplinary Center.",
    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase A gene, leading to impaired lysosomal function and resulting in both macrovascular and microvascular alterations. AFD patients often exhibit increased intima-media thickness (IMT) and reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD), indicating non-atherosclerotic arterial thickening and the potential for cardiovascular events. Nailfold capillaroscopy, a non-invasive diagnostic tool, has shown potential in diagnosing and monitoring microcirculatory disorders in AFD, despite limited research. This study evaluates nailfold capillaroscopy findings in AFD patients, exploring correlations with GLA gene variant subgroups (associated with classical or late-onset phenotypes and variants of uncertain significance (VUSs)), and assessing morpho-functional differences between sexes. It aims to determine whether capillaroscopy can assist in the early identification of individuals with multiorgan vascular involvement. A retrospective observational study was conducted with 25 AFD patients from AOUP \"G. Rodolico-San Marco\" in Catania (2020-2023). Patients underwent genetic testing, enzyme activity evaluation, and nailfold capillaroscopy using Horus basic HS 200 videodermatoscopy. Parameters like angiotectonic disorder, vascular areas, capillary density, and intimal thickening were assessed. The study identified significant differences in capillaroscopy findings among patients with different GLA gene variant subgroups. Classic AFD variant patients showed reduced capillary length and signs of erythrocyte aggregation and dilated subpapillary plexus. No correlation was found between enzymatic activity and capillaroscopy parameters. However, Lyso-Gb3 levels were positively correlated with average capillary length (ῤ = 0.453; <i>p</i> = 0.059). Sex-specific differences in capillaroscopy findings were observed in neoangiogenesis and average capillary length, with distinct implications for men and women. This study highlights the potential of nailfold capillaroscopy in the diagnostic process and clinical management of AFD, particularly in relation to specific GLA gene mutations, as a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AFD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder which leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various organs, including the heart. FD can be subdivided into classic disease resulting from negligible residual enzyme activity and a milder, atypical phenotype with later onset and less severe clinical presentation. The use of multimodality cardiac imaging including echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging is important for the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in these patients. There are gaps in the literature regarding the comprehensive description of cardiac findings of FD and its evaluation by multimodality imaging. In this review, we describe the contemporary practices and roles of multimodality cardiac imaging in individuals affected with Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are a class of complex and bioactive lipids that are involved in the pathological processes of cardiovascular disease. Fabry disease is an X-linked storage disorder that results in the pathological accumulation of glycosphingolipids in body fluids and the heart. Cardiac dyssynchrony is observed in patients with Fabry disease and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. However, little information is available on the relationship between plasma sphingolipid metabolites and LV remodelling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The purpose of this study was to assess whether the baseline plasma sphingomyelin/acid ceramidase (aCD) ratio predicts LV dyssynchrony at 6M after AMI. A total of 62 patients with AMI undergoing primary angioplasty were recruited. Plasma aCD and sphingomyelin were measured prior to primary angioplasty. Three-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of the systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI) were performed at baseline and 6 months of follow-up. The patients were divided into three groups according to the level of aCD and sphingomyelin above or below the median. Group 1 denotes lower aCD and lower sphingomyelin; Group 3 denotes higher aCD and higher sphingomyelin. Group 2 represents different categories of patients with aCD and sphingomyelin. Trend analysis showed a significant increase in the SDI from Group 1 to Group 3. Logistic regression analysis showed that the sphingomyelin/aCD ratio was a significant predictor of a worsening SDI at 6 months. AMI patients with high baseline plasma sphingomyelin/aCD ratios had a significantly increased SDI at six months. The sphingomyelin/aCD ratio can be considered as a surrogate marker of plasma ceramide load or inefficient ceramide metabolism. Plasma sphingolipid pathway metabolism may be a new biomarker for therapeutic intervention to prevent adverse remodelling after MI."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) leads to significant morbidity and mortality, which may indicate accelerated ageing. However, it is still unclear whether there is a relationship between telomere length (TL), a marker of biological ageing, and disease outcome. We aimed to examine the relationship between leukocyte TL (LTL) dynamics and the presence of advanced disease stages and/or late complications of FD, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, nephropathy and stroke, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and quantitative PCR was utilized to determine relative LTL in 99 Fabry patients. In the longitudinal analysis, we included 50 patients in whom at least three measurements were performed over a period of 5-10 years. The results showed a significant inverse correlation between LTL and age (ρ = -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant differences in LTL were found between females and males (<i>p</i> = 0.79) or between patients receiving disease-specific therapy and those without (<i>p</i> = 0.34). In a cross-sectional analysis, no association was found between the presence (<i>p</i> = 0.15) or number (<i>p</i> = 0.28) of advanced stages of the disease and/or late complications and LTL. Similarly, in a longitudinal analysis, no difference in LTL dynamics was found regarding the presence (<i>p</i> = 0.16) of advanced stage organ involvement and/or late complications or their number. These findings indicate that LTL dynamics in adulthood may not be a reliable indicator of disease outcomes in Fabry patients. Therefore, LTL may more accurately reflect the disease burden in early life, when TL is primarily determined."

Its prevalence in patients with concomitant involvement of these two organs is unknown. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of FD in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and any degree of chronic kidney disease. Patients with ventricular thickness ≥13mm and kidney disease from 29 Spanish hospitals were included. Sociodemographic variables and target organ involvement of FD were collected. Laboratory determinations of EF were carried out, with an enzymatic activity test±genetic test in men and direct genetic test in women. Eight hundred ninety-eight patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease were included. The presence of heart failure and cardiorenal syndrome was common (46.1% and 40.1%). Three patients (2 men and 1 woman) were diagnosed with FD, based on the presence of a pathogenic variant in the GLA gene and classic signs of FD, resulting in a prevalence of 0.33% (CI 95% 0.06-1%). Six patients (0.66%) presented genetic variants of unknown significance, without showing classic signs of FD, while in 13 patients (3.2%) performing the blood test was impossible. FD is an important cause of left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease. Genetic diagnosis is crucial for avoiding biases and ensuring accurate identification of FD, especially in women. The results support the inclusion of this disease in the differential diagnosis of patients with ventricular hypertrophy ≥13mm and chronic kidney disease."

The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of an alternative screening method for FD in women. A collaborative multicenter cross-sectional study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the combination of two tests (α-GAL enzyme activity assay and lyso-GL3 assay) for the diagnosis of FD in women. We included women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 to 5, receiving conservative treatment or on dialysis programs, from different nephrology services in Brazil. We evaluated 1874 patients that underwent blood collection for α-GAL and lyso-GL3 assays. Isolated decreased α-GAL enzyme activity was found in 64 patients (3.5%), while isolated increased lyso-GL3 levels were found in 67 patients (3.6%), with one patient presenting alterations in both tests. All cases with low α-GAL enzyme activity and/or increased lyso-GL3 levels underwent genetic analysis for FD variants (132 performed GLA genetic test). Low α-GAL enzyme activity had higher sensitivity and specificity to detect FD compared to the other measures (elevated lyso-GL3 alone or both altered). The negative predictive value (NPV) of α-GAL activity was 99%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 9.2%. For lyso-GL3 assay, the specificity was 99.7% and the PPV was 2.9%, therefore considered inferior to α-GAL assay. Both assays altered, had higher PPV (100%) and higher NPV (99.7%) considered the best method. We found 7 cases of GLA gene variants found, resulting in an initial prevalence of 0.37% for FD in this sample female population. This study contributes to the diagnostic value of the biomarkers α-GAL and lyso-GL3 in the context of FD in women with CKD. The combination of these biomarkers was an effective approach for the diagnosis of the disease, with high PPV and NPV."

This study included all consecutive patients diagnosed with FD referred to the Expert Center for Rare Genetic Cardiovascular Diseases between 2014-2023 which included 73 consecutive Romanian FD patients: 41 women (56.2%) and 32 men (43.8%) from 33 unrelated families. Women with FD were diagnosed later and had a later symptom onset. Comparing with men, women were less often symptomatic, but with similar symptom severity. They had similar ophthalmologic and ENT involvement, but less angiokeratomas. Both women and men had similar heart failure symptoms, which were usually mild to moderate, with no difference between the age of developing of the heart failure symptoms. There were also similar rates of acroparesthesia and stroke between sexes, but women presented less renal involvement, with less requirement for renal transplant. This study demonstrates that women with Fabry disease are not just carriers of the disease, they can present symptoms as severe as men, and they have less or later access to pathogenic therapy. Further studies with more female participations are needed to better understand the burden of Fabry disease in women."

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used for searching terms related to LSDs and gene-silencing strategies and tools. Fabry, Gaucher, and Pompe diseases and mucopolysaccharidoses I and III are the only LSDs for which gSRT has been studied, siRNA and lipid nanoparticles being the silencing strategy and the delivery system most frequently employed, respectively. Only in one recently published study was CRISPR/Cas9 applied to treat Fabry disease. Specific tissue targeting, availability of relevant cell and animal LSD models, and the rare disease condition are the main challenges with gSRT for the treatment of these diseases. Out of the 11 studies identified, only two gSRT studies were evaluated in animal models. Nucleic acid therapies are expanding the clinical tools and therapies currently available for LSDs.

This analysis assesses outcomes in patients aged 65 years or older from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) who were treated with agalsidase alfa. FOS data were extracted for adult patients aged 65 years or older who received agalsidase alfa, had baseline data and at least 3 years of post-baseline data, and had undergone no renal transplantation and/or dialysis before treatment. The data of patients who had undergone renal transplantation and/or dialysis during follow-up were excluded from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) analysis after the date of the renal transplantation and/or dialysis. Adult patients were stratified into two groups: those who started treatment before 65 years of age and who were still being treated when aged 65 years or older (group A), and those who started treatment when aged 65 years or older (group B). Mean annual changes in left ventricular mass index (LVMI), eGFR and proteinuria were assessed in group A (before and after the age of 65 years to understand if there was an age-related effect once patients turned 65 years of age) and in group B. Estimated mean (standard error [SE]) annual changes in LVMI were 0.46 (0.26) g/m<sup>2.7</sup> and 0.21 (0.42) g/m<sup>2.7</sup> in patients in group A when they were younger than 65 years and when they were aged 65 years or older, respectively, and 0.12 (0.65) g/m<sup>2.7</sup> in patients in group B.

Proteinuria remained relatively stable in both subgroups of group A (before and after the age of 65 years) and group B. Continuation and initiation of agalsidase alfa treatment in patients aged 65 years or older with Fabry disease were associated with stabilization of proteinuria and minimal increases in cardiac (LVMI) and renal (eGFR) outcomes."

The keys for this success are represented by the possibility of tissue characterization, cardiac volumes and myocardial perfusion assessment, biventricular function evaluation, with no use of ionizing radiations and with an extremely interesting profile of reproducibility. The use of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) nearly compares a non-invasive biopsy for cardiac fibrosis quantification. LGE, however, is partly unable to detect diffuse myocardial disease. These limits are overcome by new acquisition techniques, mainly T1 and T2 mapping, which allow the diagnosis and characterization of various cardiomyopathies, both ischemic and non-ischemic, such as amyloidosis (high T1), Fabry's disease (low T1), hemochromatosis (low T1), dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis.

We also analyzed the effect of A4GALT suppression on reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and transcriptome profiles through RNA sequencing. GLA-mutant hiPSC-ECs (GLA-KO and CMC-Fb-002) showed downregulated expression of EC markers and significantly reduced α-GalA expression with increased Gb-3 deposition and intra-lysosomal inclusion bodies. However, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated A4GALT suppression in GLA/A4GALT-KO and Fb-002-A4GALT-KO hiPSC-ECs increased expression levels of EC markers and rescued these FD phenotypes. GLA-mutant hiPSC-ECs failed to form tube-like structure in tube formation assays, showing significantly decreased migration of cells into the scratched wound area. In contrast, A4GALT suppression improved tube formation and cell migration capacity. Western blot analysis revealed that MAPK and AKT phosphorylation levels were downregulated while SOD and catalase were upregulated in GLA-KO hiPSC-ECs. However, suppression of A4GALT restored these protein alterations. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated significant transcriptome changes in GLA-mutant EC, especially in angiogenesis, cell death, and cellular response to oxidative stress. However, these were effectively restored in GLA/A4GALT-KO hiPSC-ECs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated A4GALT suppression rescued FD phenotype and endothelial dysfunction in GLA-mutant hiPSC-ECs, presenting a potential therapeutic approach for FD-vasculopathy."

    "abstract": "Patients with Fabry disease (FD, α-galactosidase A deficiency or absence) accumulate glycosphingolipids, leading to progressive dysfunction of kidneys, heart and nervous system. Generalizable real-world outcomes following agalsidase beta treatment initiation outside trials are limited. We investigated the associations of long-term agalsidase beta treatment with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) changes over time and the risk of developing a composite clinical event in a matched analysis of treated and untreated patients with FD. Agalsidase beta-treated adult patients (aged ≥16 years) from the Fabry Registry and adult untreated patients from a natural history cohort were matched 1:1 and X:X (with one occurrence and multiple occurrences of each untreated patient, respectively) by sex, phenotype, age and (for eGFR slope analysis) baseline eGFR. Outcomes included eGFR slope over 5 years and composite clinical event risk (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or renal event, or death) over 10+ years. As a surrogate indicator of therapeutic response in paediatric patients, the percentage experiencing normalization in plasma globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) from treatment initiation was assessed in patients aged 2 to <16 years. Overall, eGFR slopes for 1:1-matched untreated and treated adult patients [122 pairs (72.1% male)] were -3.19 and -1.47 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, respectively (reduction in rate of decline = 53.9%, <i>P</i> = .007), and for X:X-matched [122 untreated/950 treated (59.4% male)] were -3.29 and -1.56 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, respectively (reduction in rate of decline = 52.6%, <i>P</i> < .001). Agalsidase beta treatment was associated with lower risk of clinical events, with hazard ratios of 0.41 (<i>P</i> = .003) and 0.67 (<i>P</i> = .008) for 1:1-matched and X:X-matched analyses, respectively. Plasma GL-3 declined markedly in paediatric patients and normalized in most within 6 months of treatment initiation. Agalsidase beta treatment preserves kidney function and delays progression to severe clinical events among adult patients with FD. Plasma GL-3 levels analysed in paediatric patients showed normalization of elevated pre-treatment levels in most patients."

    "abstract": "In systemic lupus erythematosus, loss of immune tolerance, autoantibody production and immune complex deposition are required but not sufficient for organ damage<sup>1</sup>. How inflammatory signals are initiated and amplified in the setting of autoimmunity remains elusive. Here we set out to dissect layers and hierarchies of autoimmune kidney inflammation to identify tissue-specific cellular hubs that amplify autoinflammatory responses. Using high-resolution single-cell profiling of kidney immune and parenchymal cells, in combination with antibody blockade and genetic deficiency, we show that tissue-resident NKp46<sup>+</sup> innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are crucial signal amplifiers of disease-associated macrophage expansion and epithelial cell injury in lupus nephritis, downstream of autoantibody production. NKp46 signalling in a distinct subset of group 1 ILCs (ILC1s) instructed an unconventional immune-regulatory transcriptional program, which included the expression of the myeloid cell growth factor CSF2. CSF2 production by NKp46<sup>+</sup> ILCs promoted the population expansion of monocyte-derived macrophages. Blockade of the NKp46 receptor (using the antibody clone mNCR1.15; ref. <sup>2</sup>) or genetic deficiency of NKp46 abrogated epithelial cell injury. The same cellular and molecular patterns were operative in human lupus nephritis. Our data provide support for the idea that NKp46<sup>+</sup> ILC1s promote parenchymal cell injury by granting monocyte-derived macrophages access to epithelial cell niches. NKp46 activation in ILC1s therefore constitutes a previously unrecognized, crucial tissue rheostat that amplifies organ damage in autoimmune hosts, with broad implications for inflammatory pathologies and therapies."

    "abstract": "The Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficiency in the α-galactosidase A enzyme. Cardiovascular mortality is a major cause of death in patients with AFD and sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of death. The storage of glycosphingolipid along with ionic channel impairment, inflammation and fibrosis are involved in the arrhythmogenesis. Some risk factors have been associated with ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) and SCD. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiac fibrosis, non-sustained VTs seem to be the most important. Older age and male gender might be associated with higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. Currently, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended in patients with AFD who have survived a cardiac arrest secondary to VT/VF or who experienced sustained VT causing syncope or hemodynamic compromise, and have a life expectancy >1 year. ICD implantation is also recommended in patients considered to be at high risk (e.g., patients with severe LVH or fibrosis). The present review sought to summarize the risk of ventricular arrythmias in AFD, the indications for ICD, focusing on pathophysiology and analyzing the role of possible predictors of arrhythmias in preventing SCD, especially as primary prevention."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase-A <i>(GLA)</i> gene, disrupts lysosomal function, leading to vascular complications. The accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in arterial walls triggers upregulation of adhesion molecules, decreases endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, and induces reactive oxygen species production. This cascade results in fibrotic thickening, endothelial dysfunction, hypercontractility, vasospasm, and a pro-thrombotic phenotype. AFD patients display increased intima-media thickness (IMT) and reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD), indicating heightened cardiovascular risk. Nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) shows promise in diagnosing and monitoring microcirculatory disorders in AFD, though it remains underexplored. Morphological evidence of AFD as a storage disorder can be demonstrated through electron microscopy and immunodetection of Gb3. Secondary pathophysiological disturbances at cellular, tissue, and organ levels contribute to the clinical manifestations, with prominent lysosomal inclusions observed in vascular, cardiac, renal, and neuronal cells. Chronic accumulation of Gb3 represents a state of ongoing toxicity, leading to increased cell turnover, particularly in vascular endothelial cells. AFD-related vascular pathology includes increased renin-angiotensin system activation, endothelial dysfunction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation, resulting in IMT increase. Furthermore, microvascular alterations, such as atypical capillaries observed through NFC, suggest early microvascular involvement. This review aims to unravel the complex interplay between inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction in AFD, highlighting the potential connections between metabolic disturbances, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in vascular and cardiac complications. By exploring novel cardiovascular risk factors and potential diagnostic tools, we can advance our understanding of these mechanisms, which extend beyond sphingolipid accumulation to include other significant contributors to disease pathogenesis. This comprehensive approach can pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 15-year-old male has been experiencing fever, limb pain during exercise, and reduced sweating since childhood. During an investigation into his fever, a family history of Fabry disease was discovered, prompting a referral to our department. He was diagnosed with Fabry disease based on decreased alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity. Concurrently, his mother was found to have experienced limb pain during fevers since childhood, and she was also diagnosed with Fabry disease based on decreased α-Gal A activity. In the genetic analysis of both individuals, the IVS1+17A>G GLA variant was identified. This variant is considered benign and not classified as a pathogenic variant. Enzyme replacement therapy has been effective in improving clinical symptoms. His sister, who has not been diagnosed with Fabry disease due to normal clinical symptoms and α-GAL A activity, also had the same variant. Among the various GLA variants, many are classified as benign rather than pathogenic. In the present cases, the possibility of other factors that cannot be identified by genetic analysis is suggested, making this case significant and worth reporting."

We evaluated anterior segment ocular abnormalities based on age, sex (male and female), and genotype (wild-type, knockout [KO] male, heterozygous [HET] female, and KO female) in a rat model of Fabry disease. The α-Gal A KO and WT rats were divided into young (6-24 weeks), adult (25-60 weeks), and aged (61+ weeks) groups. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured. Eyes were clinically scored for corneal and lens opacity as well as evaluated for corneal epithelial integrity and tear break-up time (TBUT). Anterior chamber depth (ACD) and central corneal thickness (CCT) using anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The Fabry rats showed an age-dependent increase in IOP, predominantly in the male genotype. TBUT was decreased in both male and female groups with aging. Epithelial integrity was defective in KO males and HET females with age. However, it was highly compromised in KO females irrespective of age. Corneal and lens opacities were severely affected irrespective of sex or genotype in the aging Fabry rats. AS-OCT quantification of CCT and ACD also demonstrated age-dependent increases but were more pronounced in Fabry versus WT genotypes. Epithelial integrity, corneal, and lens opacities worsened in Fabry rats, whereas IOP and TBUT changes were age-dependent. Similarly, CCT and ACD were age-related but more pronounced in Fabry rats, providing newer insights into the anterior segment ocular abnormalities with age, sex, and genotype in a rat model of Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry's disease is a rare X chromosome-linked inherited lysosomal storage disease characterized by insufficient metabolism of the substrate globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) due to reduced alpha-galactosidase A (AGAL) activity. Lysosomal Gb<sub>3</sub> accumulation causes a multisystemic disease which, if untreated, reduces the life expectancy in females and males by around 10 and 20 years, respectively, due to progressive renal dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia and early occurrence of cerebral infarction. The diagnosis is confirmed by determining the reduced AGAL activity in leukocytes in males and molecular genetic detection of a -mutation causing the disease in females. The treatment comprises enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), agalsidase alfa, 0.2 mg/kg body weight (BW), agalsidase beta 1.0 mg/kg BW or pegunigalsidase alfa 1.0 mg/kg BW every 2 weeks i.v. or oral chaperone therapy (one capsule of migalastat 123 mg every other day) in the presence of amenable mutations. This article summarizes the data on the treatment of Fabry's disease and on complications in practice. The current guideline recommendations are addressed and new study results that could expand the therapeutic repertoire in the future are discussed."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease caused by an enzyme deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (α-gal A). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms. The complex pathogenesis of FD involves lysosomal dysfunction, altered autophagy, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Omics sciences, particularly transcriptomic analysis, comprehensively understand molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. This study focuses on genome-wide expression analysis in an FD human podocyte model to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of podocyte dysfunction. Human control and GLA-edited podocytes were used. Gene expression data was generated using RNA-seq analysis, and differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2. Principal component analysis and Spearman correlation have explored gene expression trends. Functional enrichment and Reporter metabolite analyses were conducted to identify significantly affected metabolites and metabolic pathways. Differential expression analysis revealed 247 genes with altered expression levels in GLA-edited podocytes compared to control podocytes. Among these genes, 136 were underexpressed, and 111 were overexpressed in GLA-edited cells. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes showed their involvement in various pathways related to oxidative stress, inflammation, fatty acid metabolism, collagen and extracellular matrix homeostasis, kidney injury, apoptosis, autophagy, and cellular stress response. The study provides insights into molecular mechanisms underlying Fabry podocyte dysfunction. Integrating transcriptomics data with genome-scale metabolic modeling further unveiled metabolic alterations in GLA-edited podocytes. This comprehensive approach contributes to a better understanding of Fabry disease and may lead to identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this rare lysosomal disorder."

Age at onset is highly variable, with a wide clinical spectrum including frequent renal, cardiac, skin and nervous system manifestations. Since pain can be an indicator of underlying FD, we wanted to estimate the prevalence of FD in a population of chronic pain patients. Two studies, DOUFAB and DOUFABIS, were carried out in expert centers for chronic pain to assess the prevalence of FD by measuring alpha galactosidase A activity in men and analysing the GLA gene in women. Analysis of 893 patients, essentially adults, led to the diagnosis of FD in one female patient, now treated with enzyme replacement therapy. The prevalence of FD is estimated about 1/1000 in our population of men and women suffering from various chronic pain. This is nearly the prevalence of FD observed in other previously screened high-risk populations with renal failure. Although a systematic search for FD does not seem relevant in the context of unexplained chronic pain in adults, a positive family history of FD or the presence of additional FD related organ features must lead to consider this rare disease diagnosis. Therefore, pain specialists need to be aware of main features of FD, including pain characteristics."

Following approval of agalsidase alfa for Fabry disease in Japan in 2006, an 8-year all-case post-marketing surveillance (PMS) showed that the treatment was well tolerated and effective for managing disease progression in adult Japanese patients. The present nationwide prospective observational study extended the initial PMS by enrolling patients who continued agalsidase alfa treatment after the initial 8-year period in a 6.5-year extension survey. Patient information from the initial PMS and the extension survey was evaluated as a single data set (observation period: February 2007-September 2021). Of 493 patients in the initial PMS, 129 (45.0% male classic, 6.2% male non-classic, 48.8% female heterozygous phenotype) consented to participate in the extension survey and were included in the analysis. The mean duration of treatment was 9.6 years. A total of 145 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in 31 patients (24%), and 22 serious ADRs occurred in 12 patients (9.3%). Although serious cardiac, renal, or cerebrovascular adverse events decreased in frequency over time in male patients, serious cardiac events continued to occur in female patients, who showed higher incidence of cardiac complications at baseline. No new safety concerns were identified. Additionally, long-term agalsidase alfa treatment sustained the initial reduction in Gb3 concentrations without increasing the rate of anti-agalsidase antibody positivity. These findings suggest that agalsidase alfa treatment demonstrates continued safety and sustains patients' clinical course over the long term."

    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has been for decades a nosological entity lacking specific therapy, with some even questioning its existence. Recently, targeted therapies have been introduced for specific, albeit rare, phenotypes such as Fabry disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and amyloidosis. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), originally developed as anti-diabetic drugs, have fortuitously emerged as effective molecules in improving the prognosis for both patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with HFpEF, reducing heart failure exacerbations by almost a third. Although there are some epidemiological differences, depending on the country and the context analyzed, it is generally agreed that HFpEF is the most represented phenotype of heart failure, and its prevalence has been increasing in recent years due to the increase in life expectancy, improved diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, and an exponential increase in risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity. These are often associated, turning out to be an epiphenomenon of a more complex cardio-nephro-metabolic disease. However, data and characteristics from major trials are not always aligned with the features and needs of these patients in real-world settings.The Cardiovascular Observatory of Friuli-Venezia Giulia is a powerful clinical governance tool that allows us to specifically characterize these patients, identifying and directing them towards the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, contributing significantly to improved prognosis and reduced expenditure paid by the National Health System.The use of SGLT2i in HFrEF patients is poised to match that of historic neurohormonal treatments, while, being the only class of drugs currently recommended by the international guidelines, they should even surpass them in HFpEF patients. However, given the high prevalence of HFpEF, it is unlikely for its treatment to be a prerogative of cardiologists alone. In this regard, it will be crucial in the near future to implement shared and integrated pathways with other medical specialists (internists, diabetologists, and nephrologists), and especially with general practitioners, who most frequently encounter these patients, to select the cases with greater complexity and potential for effective therapeutic intervention."

Among the manifestations of FD, exercise intolerance is commonly diagnosed but often underestimated, even though it significantly limits quality of life, especially in young patients. This review primarily discusses the various pathophysiological mechanisms involved in exercise intolerance in FD patients, such as altered muscle composition, compromised cardiopulmonary framework, and peripheral neuropathy. Secondarily, it explores the potential effect of available therapy, including enzyme replacement therapy and chaperone therapy (migalastat), in reducing exercise intolerance while considering the potential impact of physical activity and exercise training as adjunctive treatments. Exercise intolerance has a major impact on the well-being of people with FD. Exercise training can play an important role in addition to drug therapy."

A certain number of FD patients have burning pain or acroparesthesia in the feet and hands since childhood. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available for FD patients. However, ERT does not dramatically improve these FD-related peripheral neuropathic pain. We generated an adeno-associated virus serotype PHP.eB (AAV-PHP.eB) vector encoding mouse GLA cDNA, which was administered to FD mice intrathecally (it) or intravenously (iv). In the it-administered AAV (it-AAV) FD mice, the GLA enzyme activity in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was significantly greater than that in the untreated (NT) FD mice, and the level of activity was similar to that in wild-type (WT) B6 mice. However, in iv-administered AAV (iv-AAV) FD mice, GLA activity in the DRG did not increase compared to that in NT FD mice. Gb3 storage in the DRG of it-AAV FD mice was reduced compared to that in the DRG of NT FD mice. However, compared with NT FD mice, iv-AAV FD mice did not exhibit a significant reduction in the expression of the Gb3 substrate. Compared with WT mice, FD mice were thermally hyposensitive at 52 °C according to the hot plate test. The it-AAV FD mice showed significant recovery from thermal hyposensitivity. However, the iv-AAV FD mice did not exhibit significant improvement in thermal hyposensitivity. These results suggest that the intrathecal delivery of AAV-PHP.eB-mGLA may be a valuable tool for the treatment of FD-related peripheral neuropathic pain."

Lysosomal storage is not the unique player in organ failure and different mechanisms could drive tissue damage, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and its related signaling pathway's activation. We identified a new missense variant in the signal peptide of <i>α-GLA</i> gene, c.13 A/G, in a 55-year-old woman affected by chronic kidney disease, acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, and deafness and exhibiting normal values of lysoGb3 and αGLA activity.

Transmission electron microscopy showed signs of ER injury and intra-lysosomal inclusions. The proband's PBMC exhibited higher expression of TGFβ 1 and pNFkB compared to control. Our findings suggest that the new variant, although it did not affect enzymatic activity, could cause cellular damage by affecting ER homeostasis and promoting apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.

    "abstract": "Renal involvement is one of the most severe morbidities of Fabry disease (FD), a multisystemic lysosomal storage disease with an X-linked inheritance pattern. It results from pathogenic variants in the GLA gene (Xq22.2), which encodes the production of alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal), responsible for glycosphingolipid metabolism. Insufficient activity of this lysosomal enzyme generates deposits of unprocessed intermediate substrates, especially globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and derivatives, triggering cellular injury and subsequently, multiple organ dysfunction, including chronic nephropathy. Kidney injury in FD is classically attributed to Gb3 deposits in renal cells, with podocytes being the main target of the pathological process, in which structural and functional alterations are established early and severely. This configures a typical hereditary metabolic podocytopathy, whose clinical manifestations are proteinuria and progressive renal failure. Although late clinical outcomes and morphological changes are well established in this nephropathy, the molecular mechanisms that trigger and accelerate podocyte injury have not yet been fully elucidated. Podocytes are highly specialized and differentiated cells that cover the outer surface of glomerular capillaries, playing a crucial role in preserving the structure and function of the glomerular filtration barrier. They are frequent targets of injury in many nephropathies. Furthermore, dysfunction and depletion of glomerular podocytes are essential events implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease progression. We will review the biology of podocytes and their crucial role in regulating the glomerular filtration barrier, analyzing the main pathogenic pathways involved in podocyte injury, especially related to FD nephropathy."

At enrolment, median age was 58 years (males, 57; females, 60) with a mean eGFR of 83.7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (n = 122; males, 83.7; females, 83.8) and a median left ventricular mass index of 115.1 g/m<sup>2</sup> (n = 61; males, 131.2; females, 98.0). Mean (95% confidence interval) eGFR annualised rate of change in the overall cohort (n = 116) was -0.9 (-10.8, 9.9) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year with a similar rate of change observed across patients with varying levels of kidney function at enrolment. Despite population age and baseline morbidity, 80% of patients did not experience a FACE during the mean 3.9 years of migalastat exposure. The incidence of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular events was 2.0, 83.2, and 4.1 events per 1000 patient-years, respectively. These data support a role of migalastat in preserving renal function and multisystem effectiveness during ≥3 years of migalastat treatment in this real-world Fabry population."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to analyze patients who do not respond adequately to human recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. Four boys were analyzed: three patients diagnosed with SNP at the ages of 1) 8 years and 2 months, 2) 13 years and 2 months, 3) 16 years and 6 months, and patient 4) at the age of 6 years and 11 months - born small for gestational age (SGA). They underwent rhGH treatment. The expected growth improvement was not observed in all boys. Patient 1 was diagnosed with aortic coarctation, and after each attempt to increase the rhGH dose, nocturnal vomiting occurred - epilepsy was diagnosed. Patient 2 had severe foot pain. Patient 3 had delayed puberty - hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was diagnosed. Patient 4 had dysmorphic features. Genetic tests revealed the following: 1) mixed gonadal dysgenesis - modifying treatment; 2) Fabry disease - enzyme treatment and rhGH improved growth; 3) Kallmann syndrome - discontinuing rhGH for testosterone supplementation; 4) KBG syndrome. 1. The presence of dysmorphic features and symptoms atypical for growth hormone deficiencies could warrant genetic diagnostics before initiating treatment. 2. Lack of significant improvement in growth is an indication for reevaluation of patients who have not completed growth. 3. Genetic studies in this patient group often elucidate the causes of slow growth rate. 4. The case authors have developed a proposal for a multicentre program aimed at establishing indications for genetic diagnosis in children diagnosed with SNP and SGA treated with rhGH."

To overcome the primary limitation associated with PSi biosensors-namely, their relatively poor sensitivity due to issues related to complex mass transfer phenomena and reaction kinetics-we employed two strategic approaches: First, we sought to optimize the porous nanostructure with respect to factors including layer thickness, pore diameter, and capture probe density. Second, we leveraged convection properties by integrating the resulting biosensor into a 3D-printed microfluidic system that also had one of two different micromixer architectures (i.e., staggered herringbone micromixers or microimpellers) embedded. We demonstrated that tailoring the PSi aptasensor significantly improved its performance, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 nM-which is >1 order of magnitude lower than that achieved using previously-developed biosensors of this type. Moreover, integration into microfluidic systems that incorporated passive and active micromixers further enhanced the aptasensor's sensitivity, achieving an additional reduction in the LOD by yet another order of magnitude. These advancements demonstrate the potential of combining PSi-based optical transducers with microfluidic technology to create sensitive label-free biosensing platforms for the detection of GI inflammatory biomarkers."

We present the case of a 54-year-old man with cardiovascular risk factors and aggravated exertional dyspnoea in the past year, in whom the echocardiography showed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Cardiac magnetic resonance was used as differential diagnosis tool between sarcomeric HOCM and other phenocopies, suggesting a cardiac involvement of FD. Final diagnosis was formulated based on genetic testing and enzymatic activity of α-galactosidase. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was addressed by alcohol septal ablation successfully both in short term as well as at 1-year follow-up. The present case illustrates the complex clinical pathway of a patient with HOCM due to FD, where multimodality imaging was instrumental from differential diagnosis to therapeutic choices, which addressed both the pathogenic background and the organ involvement. Although at the moment the number of patients with of FD cardiomyopathy undergoing LVOTO reduction therapies is scarce, current recommendations should be extended to also include these patients."

We report a case of sudden cardiac arrest in a 39-year-old male with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis with a history of Fabry disease by kidney biopsy. Autopsy revealed significant circumferential annular calcification in both mitral and aortic valves with a caseous gross appearance. Histologically, these areas consisted of amorphous basophilic material accompanied by a surrounding granulomatous-appearing infiltrate. Von Kossa staining on non-decalcified tissue revealed strong positive staining, confirming CCMA diagnosis. While identifiable, the atrioventricular node was displaced and distorted by caseous deposits. Toluidine blue staining of myocardium showed osmophilic accumulations, and electron microscopy (EM) showed myeloid/zebra bodies, consistent with Fabry disease. We posit that Fabry disease leads to end-stage kidney disease, altering calcium phosphate metabolism, a proposed mechanism for CCMA. This case highlights the multifactorial nature of sudden cardiac death in decedents with various structural cardiac changes and potential renal-disease-induced electrolyte imbalances. We aim to bring awareness to this rare entity, its potential role in a sudden cardiac death, and to highlight the need to use non-decalcified tissue when staining for calcium to establish the diagnosis."

We aimed to assess the prevalence of FD in a Chinese population with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) whilst implementing a gender-specific screening approach. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with LVH, defined as a maximum thickness of the left ventricular septal/posterior wall ≥ 13 mm, were considered eligible. All patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were excluded. Plasma α-galactosidase (α-GLA) enzyme activity was assessed using a dried blood spot test. Males with low enzyme activity underwent genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis of FD whereas females were screened for both α-GLA and globotriaosylsphingosine concentration and underwent genetic analysis of the GLA gene only if testing positive for ≥1 parameter. <b>Results:</b> 426 unrelated patients (age = 64.6 ± 13.0 years; female: male = 113:313) were evaluated. FD was diagnosed in 3 unrelated patients (age = 69.0 ± 3.5 years, female: male = 1:2) and 1 related female subject (age = 43 years). Genetic analyses confirmed the late-onset cardiac variant GLA c.640-801G>A (<i>n</i> = 3) and the missense variant c.869T>C associated with classic FD (<i>n</i> = 1). Cardiac complications were the only significant findings associated with the late-onset c.640-801G>A mutation, manifesting as mild or severe concentric LVH. In contrast, the classic c.869T>C mutation FD exhibited multisystemic manifestations in addition to severe concentric LVH. <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of FD is lower in Chinese patients with LVH when HCM is excluded. The pathological variant c.640-801G>A remains the most common cause of late-onset FD, while the detection of FD in females can be improved by utilizing a gender-specific screening method."

Brain MRIs of 53 subjects with FD (mean age, 40.7 [SD, 12.4] years; male/female ratio = 23:30) were collected in this single-center study. Mean BA diameter and its tortuosity index were calculated on MRA. Possible correlations between these metrics and clinical, laboratory, and advanced imaging variables of the posterior circulation were tested. In a subgroup of 20 subjects, a 2-year clinical and imaging follow-up was available, and possible longitudinal changes of these metrics and their ability to predict clinical scores were also probed. No significant association was found between MRA metrics and any clinical, laboratory, or advanced imaging variable (<i>P</i> values ranging from -0.006 to 0.32). At the follow-up examination, no changes were observed with time for the mean BA diameter (<i>P</i> = .84) and the tortuosity index (<i>P</i> = .70). Finally, baseline MRA variables failed to predict the clinical status of patients with FD at follow-up (<i>P</i> = .42 and 0.66, respectively). Alterations of the BA in FD lack of any meaningful association with clinical, laboratory, or advanced imaging findings collected in this study. Furthermore, this lack of correlation seems constant across time, suggesting stability over time. Taken together, these results suggest that the role of BA dolichoectasia in FD should be reconsidered."

Since there is a close relationship linking serum TWEAK (sTWEAK), inflammation, and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in various kidney diseases, we aimed to determine the relationship between sTWEAK levels and CIMT in subjects with and without proteinuria in a cross-sectional study involving 15 FD patients (seven females, eight males) and seven healthy controls (four females, three males). There were no differences in age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and biochemical parameters (serum glucose, albumin, creatinine, uric acid, C-reactive protein (CRP), low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein) between FD patients and healthy controls. The spot urine protein-creatinine ratios of healthy controls and FD patients were 90 mg/g and 185 mg/g, respectively (P = 0.022). STWEAK levels were higher in FD patients than in healthy controls (P = 0.007). The CIMT of FD patients and healthy controls was 0.55 ± 0.14 mm and 0.42 ± 0.04 mm, respectively (P = 0.007). STWEAK was positively correlated with CRP and CIMT, and negatively with proteinuria (P = 0.005, P = 0.013, and P = 0.018, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, only sTWEAK was an independent variable of increased CIMT. We demonstrated that sTWEAK and CIMT were increased in FD patients.

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a genetic sphingolipidosis involving virtually the entire body. Among its manifestation, the involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system is frequent. In recent decades, it has become evident that, besides cerebrovascular damage, a pure neuronal phenotype of AFD exists in the central nervous system, which is supported by clinical, pathological, and neuroimaging data. This neurodegenerative phenotype is often clinically characterized by an extrapyramidal component similar to the one seen in prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD). We analyzed the biological, clinical pathological, and neuroimaging data supporting this phenotype recently proposed in the literature. Moreover, we compared the neurodegenerative PD phenotype of AFD with a classical monogenic vascular disease responsible for vascular parkinsonism and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). A substantial difference in the clinical and neuroimaging features of neurodegenerative and vascular parkinsonism phenotypes emerged, with AFD being potentially responsible for both forms of the extrapyramidal involvement, and CADASIL mainly associated with the vascular subtype. The available studies share some limitations regarding both patients' information and neurological and genetic investigations. Further studies are needed to clarify the potential association between AFD and extrapyramidal manifestations."

    "abstract": "People with rare lysosomal storage diseases face challenges in their care that arise from disease complexity and heterogeneity, compounded by many healthcare professionals being unfamiliar with these diseases. These challenges can result in long diagnostic journeys and inadequate care. Over 30 years ago, the Rare Disease Registries for Gaucher, Fabry, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I and Pompe diseases were established to address knowledge gaps in disease natural history, clinical manifestations of disease and treatment outcomes. Evidence generated from the real-world data collected in these registries supports multiple stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, drug developers, researchers and regulators. To maximise the impact of real-world evidence from these registries, engagement and collaboration with the patient communities is essential. To this end, the Rare Disease Registries Patient Council was established in 2019 as a partnership between the Rare Disease Registries and global and local patient advocacy groups to share perspectives on how registry data are used and disseminated. The Patient Council has resulted in a number of patient initiatives including patient representation at Rare Disease Registries advisory boards; development of plain language summaries of registry publications to increase availability of real-world evidence to patient communities; and implementation of digital innovations such as electronic patient-reported outcomes, and patient-facing registry reports and electronic consent (in development), all to enhance patient engagement. The Patient Council is building on the foundations of industry-patient advocacy group collaboration to fully integrate patient communities in decision-making and co-create solutions for the rare disease community."

Early detection of FD is challenging, accounting for delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation. This study aimed to develop an algorithm using a logistic regression model to facilitate early identification of patients based on ICD-10-GM coding using a German Sickness Fund Database. The logistic regression model was fitted on a binary outcome variable based on either a treated FD cohort or a control cohort (without FD). Comorbidities specific to the involved organs were used as covariates to identify potential FD patients with ICD-10-GM E75.2 diagnosis but without any FD-specific medication. Specificity and sensitivity of the model were optimized to determine a likely threshold. The cut-point with the largest values for the Youden index and concordance probability method and the lowest value for closest to (0,1) was identified as 0.08 for each respective value. The sensitivity and specificity for this cut-point were 80.4% and 79.8%, respectively. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the potential FD patients with at least two codes of E75.2 diagnoses was performed. A total of 284 patients were identified in the potential FD cohort using the logistic regression model. Most potential FD patients were < 30 years old and female. The identification and incidence rates of FD in the potential FD cohort were markedly higher than those of the treated FD cohort. This model serves as a tool to identify potential FD patients using German insurance claims data."

The current standard of care, enzyme replacement therapies, while effective in reducing kidney pathology when treated early, do not fully ameliorate cardiac issues, neuropathic manifestations, and risk of cerebrovascular events. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies (AAV-GT) can provide superior efficacy across multiple tissues owing to continuous, endogenous production of the therapeutic enzyme and lower treatment burden. We set out to develop a robust AAV-GT to achieve optimal efficacy with the lowest feasible dose to minimize any safety risks that are associated with high-dose AAV-GTs. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the effectiveness of an rAAV9 vector expressing human <i>GLA</i> transgene under a strong ubiquitous promoter, combined with woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (rAAV9-h<i>GLA</i>). We tested our GT at three different doses, 5e10 vg/kg, 2.5e11 vg/kg, and 6.25e12 vg/kg in the G3Stg/GLAko Fabry mouse model that has tissue Gb3 substrate levels comparable with patients with FD and develops several early FD pathologies. After intravenous injections of rAAV9-h<i>GLA</i> at 11 weeks of age, we observed dose-dependent increases in α-Gal activity in the key target tissues, reaching as high as 393-fold of WT in the kidneys and 6156-fold in the heart at the highest dose. Complete or near-complete substrate clearance was observed in animals treated with the two higher dose levels tested in all tissues except for the brain. We also found dose-dependent improvements in several pathological biomarkers, as well as prevention of structural and functional organ pathology. Taken together, these results indicate that an AAV-GT under a strong ubiquitous promoter has the potential to address the unmet therapeutic needs in patients with FD at relatively low doses."

Recently, plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), a pathogenic analog of a substrate of GAL, has been suggested as a potential biomarker for FD, and disease severity scores, such as the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), the Disease Severity Scoring System (DS3), and FASTEX (FAbry STabilization indEX), are useful tools for evaluating the severity of signs and symptoms in symptomatic FD patients. However, a more useful method of evaluating disease severity in early-diagnosed FD patients such as children, adult females, and asymptomatic patients is needed. Here, we proposed modified MSSI and DS3 scores to which we added phenotype, urinary mulberry bodies, and history of past pain attacks and examined the clinical usefulness of lyso-Gb3 and modified scores for early-diagnosed FD patients. In 13 early-diagnosed FD patients, we developed modified MSSI and DS3 scores and examined the correlation of lifetime lyso-Gb3 exposure at diagnosis with the conventional or modified scores. Lifetime lyso-Gb3 exposure was positively correlated only with the modified DS3 score. Additionally, we examined the long-term changes in plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration and in conventional MSSI, DS3, and FASTEX. In males, plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration decreased more rapidly than in females. In all patients, the severity scores were mild and remained nearly stable throughout the follow-up period. Our data suggest that lifetime lyso-Gb3 exposure and the modified DS3 score are useful in early-diagnosed patients."

The mean age was 45±17 years (range: 22-75 years), with a female/male ratio of 2:3. All patients had tortuous conjunctival vessels and 12 patients (80%) had conjunctival aneurysms. Cornea verticillata was present in 10 patients (66.6%), lens opacification in 4 patients (26.6%), and retinal vascular tortuosity in 8 patients (53.3%). All patients had at least two different ocular findings; most (3 heterozygotes/7 hemizygotes) had a combination of corneal verticillata and conjunctival vessel abnormality. The conjunctiva, cornea, and retina were affected together in 5 hemizygous patients (33.3%). One hemizygous patient had all FDrelated ocular manifestations in both eyes. To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the ocular manifestations of FD in the Turkish population. Although cornea verticillata is considered a hallmark of FD, it was absent in approximately one-third of patients. Moreover, cataract, another well-known feature of FD, was present in only 26.6% of the patients. Conjunctival vascular abnormality alone seems to be quite rare in FD, although it often accompanies other ocular manifestations. Therefore, recognition of other mild findings and special consideration of their associations may increase the diagnostic value of ocular findings in FD."

The recruitment period consists of two parts: the retrospective enrolment period, from January 1981 to December 2023, and the prospective enrolment period, spanning from January 2024 to December 2031. The registry collects baseline and follow-up data, including the enrolment setting, patient demographics, family history, symptoms, clinical manifestations, electrocardiogram, cardiovascular imaging, laboratory assessment, medical therapy, genetic testing results, and outcomes. The IFDCR is a national, multicentre, registry that includes patients with FD. It holds detailed and multiparametric data across the patient pathway and clinical manifestations, acting as a powerful tool for improving the quality of care and conducting high-impact research."

    "title": "Inflammation in Fabry disease: stages, molecular pathways, and therapeutic implications.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease, a multisystem X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-galactosidase gene. This leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3), culminating in various clinical signs and symptoms that significantly impact quality of life. Although treatments such as enzyme replacement, oral chaperone, and emerging therapies like gene therapy exist; delayed diagnosis often curtails their effectiveness. Our review highlights the importance of delineating the stages of inflammation in Fabry disease to enhance the timing and efficacy of diagnosis and interventions, particularly before the progression to fibrosis, where treatment options are less effective. Inflammation is emerging as an important aspect of the pathogenesis of Fabry disease. This is thought to be predominantly mediated by the innate immune response, with growing evidence pointing towards the potential involvement of adaptive immune mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Highlighted by the fact that Fabry disease shares immune profiles with systemic autoinflammatory diseases, blurring the distinctions between these disorders and highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of immune dynamics. This insight is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving the administration of current treatments like enzyme replacement. Moreover, our review discusses the complex interplay between these inflammatory processes and current treatments, such as the challenges posed by anti-drug antibodies. These antibodies can attenuate the effectiveness of therapies, necessitating more refined approaches to mitigate their impact. By advancing our understanding of the molecular changes, inflammatory mediators and causative factors that drive inflammation in Fabry disease, we aim to clarify their role in the disease's progression. This improved understanding will help us see how these processes fit into the current landscape of Fabry disease. Additionally, it will guide the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving patient care."

This paper offers a meticulous overview of the clinical phenotype and relevant auxiliary examination results of nine confirmed FD patients with the <i>p.G183D</i> gene variant from two families. Pedigree analysis was conducted on two male patients with the gene variant, followed by biochemical and genetic screening of all high-risk relatives. Subsequently, evaluation of multiple organ systems and comprehensive instrument assessment were performed on heterozygotes of the <i>p.G183D</i> gene variant. The study revealed that all patients exhibited varying degrees of cardiac involvement, with two demonstrating left ventricular wall thickness exceeding 15 mm on echocardiography, and the remaining six exceeding 11 mm. Impaired renal function was evident in all six patients with available blood test data, two of whom underwent kidney transplantation. Eight cases reported neuropathic pain, and five experienced varying degrees of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study indicates that the <i>GLA p.G183D</i> gene variant can induce premature organ damage, particularly affecting the heart, kidneys, and nervous system."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting glycosphingolipid metabolism. Most FD patients have cardiac involvement, mainly manifested as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), leading to early death due to complications (arrhythmias, valvular disease, vascular involvement). Early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) before fibrosis development has been associated with better cardiac outcomes in terms of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and functional parameters. A retrospective observational study was conducted in patients with FD treated with agalsidase alfa for at least 2 years. The primary objectives were: [a] to assess the annual rate of change in LVMI; [b] to define the overall incidence of stability, regression or progression of LVMI. Forty-nine patients were included in the final analysis, with a median follow-up of 7 years. The overall change in LVMI was 0.38 g/m2.73/year, without significant influence of baseline LVH, gender, age at ERT initiation, LV ejection fraction, body mass index, renal disease, and classical cardiovascular risk factors. Long-term ERT with agalsidase alfa was associated with stabilization of LVMI in 98% of patients with FD and was independent of the same covariables. Our results are in line with previous literature of comparable FD populations and probably represent the first study of its kind in Argentina. We here highlight the importance of cardiac morphometric stability as a positive outcome of ERT."

Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is the predominantly accumulated sphingolipid. Gb3, deacylated-Gb3 (lysoGb3), and methylated-Gb3 (metGb3) have been suggested as FD biomarkers. We developed a novel LC-MS/MS method for assessing lysoGb3 levels in plasma and Gb3 and metGb3 in urine and tested 62 FD patients, 34 patients with GLA variants of unknown significance (VUS) and 59 healthy controls. AGAL activity in white blood cells (WBCs) and plasma was evaluated in parallel. In males, lysoGb3 concentrations in plasma separated classic and late-onset FD patients from each other and from individuals carrying GLA VUS and healthy controls. Calculating AGAL activity/plasmatic lysoGb3 ratio allowed to correctly categorize all females with classic and majority of patients with late-onset FD phenotypes. Correlation of AGAL activity in WBCS with lipid biomarkers identified threshold activity values under which the biomarkers' concentrations increase. We developed a novel simplified LC-MS/MS method for quantitation of plasma lysoGb3. AGAL activity/plasma lysoGb3 ratio was identified as the best predictor for FD. AGAL activity correlated with plasma lysoGb3 and corresponded to individual FD phenotypes."

The R112H mutation of GLA is relatively common in Japanese FD patients, characterized by a late-onset phenotype, almost normal to mild lyso-Gb3 elevation, and mild clinical symptoms, despite low GLA activity. This is due to the structural features of the R112H GLA protein. We herein report the case of a 42-year-old male patient with late-onset FD with a R112H mutation. The patient exhibited only renal involvement with no other organ damage and was successfully treated with galactosidase beta and subsequent migalastat for approximately 10 years. Especially, migalastat was clinically effective in normalizing plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and inhibiting the progression of renal damage associated with FD. Therefore, the use of migalastat in the FD patients with R112H mutation is highly recommended based on this case report."

Accumulation of Gb<sub>3</sub> in patients' cells, tissues, and biological fluids causes clinical manifestations including ventricular hypertrophy, renal insufficiency, and strokes. This protocol describes a methodology to analyze urinary Gb<sub>3</sub> and creatinine. Samples are diluted with an internal standard solution containing Gb<sub>3</sub>(C17:0) and creatinine-D<sub>3</sub>, centrifuged, and directly analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using an 8.7-min method. Eight Gb<sub>3</sub> isoforms [C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:1, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, and (C24:0)OH] are analyzed and the total is normalized to creatinine. Confirmation ions are monitored to detect potential interferences. The Gb<sub>3</sub> limit of quantification is 0.023 µg/ml. Its interday coefficients of variation (3 concentrations measured) are ≤15.4%. This method minimizes matrix effects (≤6.5%) and prevents adsorption or precipitation of Gb<sub>3</sub>.

This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, particularly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in various tissues and organs, which can result in life-threatening complications. The clinical presentation of the disease can vary from the \"classic\" phenotype with pediatric onset and multi-organ involvement to the \"later-onset\" phenotype, which presents with predominantly cardiac symptoms. In recent years, advances in screening studies have led to the identification of an increasing number of variants of unknown significance that have not yet been described, and whose pathogenic role remains undetermined. In this clinical report, we describe the case of an asymptomatic adult female who was found to have a new variant of unknown significance, p.Met70Val. Given the unknown pathogenic role of this variant, a thorough analysis of the potential organ involvement was conducted. The clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. The analysis revealed that there were no signs of significant organ involvement, and the benignity of the variant was confirmed. This case underscores the importance of a comprehensive evaluation of new variants of unknown significance to establish their pathogenicity accurately."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a significant decrease in the activity or absence of the enzyme α-galactosidase A. The diagnostics of Fabry disease during newborn screening are reasonable, due to the availability of enzyme replacement therapy. This paper presents an electrochemical method using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs) with hafnium oxide-sensitive surfaces for the detection of α-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spot extracts. The capability of ISFETs to detect the reaction catalyzed by α-galactosidase A was demonstrated. The buffer composition was optimized to provide suitable conditions for both enzyme and ISFET performance. The use of ISFET structures as sensor elements allowed for the label-free detection of enzymatic reactions with melibiose, a natural substrate of α-galactosidase A, instead of a synthetic fluorogenic one. ISFET chips were packaged with printed circuit boards and microfluidic reaction chambers to enable long-term signal measurement using a custom device. The packaged sensors were demonstrated to discriminate between normal and inhibited GLA activity in dried blood spots extracts. The described method offers a promising solution for increasing the widespread distribution of newborn screening of Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an invalidating multisystemic disorder affecting α-Galactosidase, a rate-limiting hydrolase dedicated to lipid catabolism. Non-metabolized substrates, such as Globotriaosylceramide and its derivatives trigger the direct or indirect activation of inflammatory events and endothelial dysfunction. In spite of the efficacy demonstrated by enzyme replacement therapy or pharmacological chaperones in delaying disease progression, few studies have analyzed whether these treatments can improve the pro-inflammatory state of FD patients. Therefore, the aim of this work was to assess cytokines and cardiovascular risk-related proteins detectable in plasma from FD patients, whether treated or not with ERT, to evaluate the reliability of these markers in monitoring disease stage and treatment effects. We identified inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers (ADAMTS-13, TNF-α, GDF-15, MIP-1β, VEGFA, MPO, and MIC-1) that cooperate in a common pathway and are increased in FD patients' plasma samples. As shown by the assessment of these proteins over time, they can help to evaluate the risk of higher severity in FD, as well as ERT effects. Even though the analyzed proteins cannot be considered as proper biomarkers due to their non-specificity to FD, taken together they can provide a signature of reference molecules with prognostic value for early diagnosis, and evaluation of disease progression and treatment efficacy, using blood samples."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked disease characterized by deficient expression and activity of alpha-galactosidase A with consequent lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, particularly globotriaosylceramide in various organs. Currently, enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human α-galactosidase is the cornerstone of the treatment of Fabry patients, although in the long term enzyme replacement therapy fails to halt disease progression, in particular in case of late diagnosis. This suggests that the adverse outcomes cannot be justified by the lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids alone, and that additional therapies targeted at further pathophysiologic mechanisms might contribute to halting the progression of cardiac, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in Fabry patients. Recent evidence points toward the involvement of oxidative stress, oxidative stress signaling and inflammation in the pathophysiology of cardio cerebrovascular and kidney damage in Fabry patients. This review reports the current knowledge of the involvement of oxidative stress in Fabry disease, which clearly points toward the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of the medium to long-term cardio-cerebrovascular-kidney damage of Fabry patients and summarizes the antioxidant therapeutic approaches currently available in the literature. This important role played by oxidative stress suggests potential novel additional therapeutic interventions by either pharmacologic or nutritional measures, on top of enzyme replacement therapy, aimed at improving/halting the progression of cardio-cerebrovascular disease and nephropathy that occur in Fabry patients."

    "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a common clinical finding. Differential diagnosis includes Fabry disease, a rare and progressive, but treatable storage disease caused by deficiency of α-galactosidase A. However, diagnosis of Fabry is often hampered by its clinical heterogeneity, LV hypertrophy phenocopies and unawareness of the clinician. This review summarises clinical data, family history, electrocardiogram (ECG) and imaging (echocardiogram and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)) characteristics to differentiate aetiologies of LV hypertrophy including clues for the diagnosis of Fabry. LV hypertrophy is a consequence of pressure overload mostly, but differential diagnosis includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and infiltrative diseases. Clinical data, ECG, type and degree of LV hypertrophy, functional and tissue characteristics differ among aetiologies. LV hypertrophy in Fabry is progressive and mostly concentric but may copy any hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Dependent on residual alfa-galactosidase A enzyme activity, degree of LV hypertrophy in Fabry may vary. Initially, low myocardial CMR T1-map values are calculated. At a later stage, midwall late gadolinium enhancement of the inferolateral LV wall may occur. Global longitudinal strain may be depressed in the inferolateral wall. Voltage criteria for LV hypertrophy and short PQ interval are common. Right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy is frequent. In addition, multisystemic symptoms including neuropathic pain, hypohidrosis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and familial young stroke are pointing to Fabry. LV hypertrophy should raise suspicion of Fabry disease, especially if LV hypertrophy is unexplained and/or associated with RV hypertrophy. In Fabry, LV hypertrophy may be heterogeneous and mimic any hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ECG, multisystemic symptoms and imaging may provide clues for Fabry."

We retrospectively analysed the global, subendocardial, subepicardial LV radial strain, the corresponding strain gradient, as well as the regional and global longitudinal strain. The diagnostic accuracy of the diverse LV strain analyses was comparatively assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and multivariable regression analyses. In 40 FD and 76 CA patients, CA featured more reduced layer strain values [global RS -12.3 (-15.6 to -9.6) in CA vs. -16.7 (-20.0 to -13.6) in FD; <i>P</i> < 0.001; subendocardial RS -22.3 (-27.4 to -15.9) vs. -28.3 (-31.8 to -23.6), <i>P</i> < 0.001; subepicardial RS -6.6 (-8.6 to -4.7) in CA vs. -8.9 (-11.7 to - 6.5) in FD; <i>P</i> < 0.001]. Global radial and longitudinal strain held an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 (0.66-0.84) and AUC 0.73 (0.63-0.83). While the apical sparing and PLSD strain pattern showed the highest accuracy as single parameters [AUC 0.87 (0.79-0.95) and 0.81 (0.72-0.89), <i>P</i> < 0.001], the combination of subendocardial RS and the apical sparing pattern featured the highest diagnostic accuracy [AUC 0.92 (0.87-0.97)].

We experienced a male case of FD under ERT, he was placed on hemodialysis and presented rapidly progressive cognitive function. A 51-year-old male patient with FD has been receiving ERT from age of 38 years. Hemodialysis was initiated at the age of 47 years. The patient experienced several attacks of cerebral infarction, and brain images demonstrated wide-spread asymptomatic ischemic lesions. His behavior became problematic at the age of 51 years. He often exhibited restlessness during hemodialysis sessions and failure to communicate effectively. The patient experienced impairment of attention and executive function, topographical disorientation, and amnesia. Consequently, it was necessary for medical staff and family members to monitor his behavior for safe extracorporeal circulation and daily life activities. Annual standardized neuropsychiatric testing revealed worsening of cognitive performance.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is characterized by deficient activity of α-galactosidase A (GLA). Consequently, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulates in various organs, causing cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular damage. Gene therapies for FD have been investigated in humans. Strong conditioning is required for hematopoietic stem cell-targeted gene therapy (HSC-GT). However, strong conditioning leads to various side effects and should be avoided. In this study, we tested antibody-based conditioning for HSC-GT in wild-type and FD model mice. After preconditioning with an antibody-drug conjugate, HSC-GT using a lentiviral vector was performed in wild-type and Fabry model mice. In the wild-type experiment, the EGFP gene was introduced into HSCs and transplanted into preconditioned mice, and donor chimerism and EGFP expression were analyzed. In the FD mouse model, the GLA gene was introduced into HSCs and transplanted into preconditioned Fabry mice. GLA activity and Gb3 accumulation in the organs were analyzed. In the wild-type mouse experiment, when anti-CD45 antibody-drug conjugate was used, the percentage of donor cells at 6 months was 64.5%, and 69.6% of engrafted donor peripheral blood expressed EGFP. When anti-CD117 antibody-drug conjugate and ATG were used, the percentage of donor cells at 6 months was 80.7%, and 73.4% of engrafted donor peripheral blood expressed EGFP. Although large variations in GLA activity among mice were observed in the FD mouse experiment for both preconditioning regimens, Gb3 was significantly reduced in many organs. Antibody-based preconditioning may be an alternative preconditioning strategy for HSC-GT for treating FD."

    "title": "Cardiac manifestations of Fabry disease in G3Stg/GlaKO and GlaKO mouse models-Translation to Fabry disease patients.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by mutations in the GLA gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal). Loss of α-Gal activity leads to progressive lysosomal accumulation of α-Gal substrate, predominately globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated derivative globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3). FD manifestations include early onset neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and later onset life-threatening renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. Current treatments can preserve kidney function but are not very effective in preventing progression of cardiovascular pathology which remains the most common cause of premature death in FD patients. There is a significant need for a translational model that could be used for testing cardiac efficacy of new drugs. Two mouse models of FD have been developed. The α-Gal A-knockout (GlaKO) model is characterized by progressive tissue accumulation of Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 but does not develop any Fabry pathology besides mild peripheral neuropathy. Reports of minor cardiac function abnormalities in GlaKO model are inconsistent between different studies. Recently, G3Stg/GlaKO was generated by crossbreeding GlaKO with transgenic mice expressing human Gb3 synthase. G3Stg/GlaKO demonstrate higher tissue substrate accumulation and develop cellular and tissue pathologies. Functional renal pathology analogous to that found in early stages of FD has also been described in this model. The objective of this study is to characterize cardiac phenotype in GlaKO and G3Stg/GlaKO mice using echocardiography. Longitudinal assessments of cardiac wall thickness, mass and function were performed in GlaKO and wild-type (WT) littermate controls from 5-13 months of age. G3Stg/GlaKO and WT mice were assessed between 27-28 weeks of age due to their shortened lifespan. Several cardiomyopathy characteristics of early Fabry pathology were found in GlaKO mice, including mild cardiomegaly [up-to-25% increase in left ventricular (LV mass)] with no significant LV wall thickening. The LV internal diameter was significantly wider (up-to-24% increase at 9-months), when compared to the age-matched WT. In addition, there were significant increases in the end-systolic, end-diastolic volumes and stroke volume, suggesting volume overload. Significant reduction in Global longitudinal strain (GLS) measuring local myofiber contractility of the LV was also detected at 13-months. Similar GLS reduction was also reported in FD patients. Parameters such as ejection fraction, fractional shortening and cardiac output were either only slightly affected or were not different from controls. On the other hand, some of the cardiac findings in G3Stg/GlaKO mice were inconsistent with Fabry cardiomyopathy seen in FD patients. This could be potentially an artifact of the Gb3 synthase overexpression under a strong ubiquitous promoter. In conclusion, GlaKO mouse model presents mild cardiomegaly, mild cardiac dysfunction, but significant cardiac volume overload and functional changes in GLS that can be used as translational biomarkers to determine cardiac efficacy of novel treatment modalities. The level of tissue Gb3 accumulation in G3Stg/GlaKO mouse more closely recapitulates the level of substrate accumulation in FD patients and may provide better translatability of the efficacy of new therapeutics in clearing pathological substrates from cardiac tissues. But interpretation of the effect of treatment on cardiac structure and function in this model should be approached with caution."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) causes cold-evoked pain and impaired cold perception through small fiber damage, which also occurs in polyneuropathies (PNP) of other origins. The integrity of thinly myelinated fibers and the spinothalamic tract is assessable by cold-evoked potentials (CEPs). In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical value of CEP by investigating its associations with pain, autonomic measures, sensory loss, and neuropathic signs. CEPs were examined at the hand and foot dorsum of patients with FD (<i>n</i> = 16) and PNP (<i>n</i> = 21) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 23). Sensory phenotyping was performed using quantitative sensory testing (QST). The painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ), FabryScan, and measures for the autonomic nervous system were applied. Group comparisons and correlation analyses were performed. CEPs of 87.5% of the FD and 85.7% of the PNP patients were eligible for statistical analysis. In all patients combined, CEP data correlated significantly with cold detection loss, PDQ items, pain, and autonomic measures. Abnormal CEP latency in FD patients was associated with an abnormal heart frequency variability item (<i>r</i> = -0.684; adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.04). In PNP patients, CEP latency correlated significantly with PDQ items, and CEP amplitude correlated with autonomic measures (<i>r</i> = 0.688, adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.008; <i>r</i> = 0.619, adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.024). Furthermore, mechanical pain thresholds differed significantly between FD (gain range) and PNP patients (loss range) (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Abnormal CEPs were associated with current pain, neuropathic signs and symptoms, and an abnormal function of the autonomic nervous system. The latter has not been mirrored by QST parameters. Therefore, CEPs appear to deliver a wider spectrum of information on the sensory nervous system than QST alone."

    "title": "Double Hit of Hydroxichloroquine and Amiodarone Induced Renal Phospholipidosis in a Patient with Monoclonal Gammopathy and Sclerodermiform Syndrome: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Phospholipidosis is a rare disorder which consists of an excessive intracellular accumulation of phospholipids and the appearance of zebra bodies or lamellar bodies when looking at them using electron microscopy. This disease is associated with certain genetic diseases or is secondary to drugs or toxins. Drug-induced phospholipidosis encompasses many types of pharmaceuticals, most notably chloroquine, amiodarone or ciprofloxacin. Clinically and histologically, renal involvement can be highly variable, with the diagnosis not being made until the zebra bodies are seen under an electron microscope. These findings may require genetic testing to discount Fabry disease, as its histological findings are indistinguishable. Most of the chemicals responsible are cationic amphiphilic drugs, and several mechanisms have been hypothesized for the formation of zebra bodies and their pathogenic significance. However, the relationship between drug toxicity and phospholipid accumulation, zebra bodies and organ dysfunction remains enigmatic, as do the renal consequences of drug withdrawal. We present, to our knowledge, the first case report of acute renal injury with a monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance, lesions, and sclerodermiform syndrome, with zebra bodies that were associated with the initiation of a hydroxychloroquine and amiodarone treatment, as an example of drug-induced-phospholipidosis."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of rare hereditary metabolic diseases. Due to a deficiency of lysosomal enzymes, complex substrates accumulate in the lysosomes of various organs. Depending on the affected enzyme, this results in clinically variable and chronic progressive multiorgan diseases. Diagnosis is often delayed. As clinical symptoms include the musculoskeletal system, an awareness of lysosomal storage diseases is of relevance to (pediatric) rheumatologists. This article is focused on Mucopolysaccharidosis type I‑S, Mucolipidosis type III, Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. When suspecting a lysosomal storage disease, enzyme activity should be determined in dried blood spots or leukocytes. For some diseases, specific biomarkers can additionally be analyzed. Diagnosis should be confirmed by genetic testing. As causal treatment options are available for three of the presented diseases, a timely diagnosis is very important."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which encodes the enzyme α-galactosidase A. The GLA gene is located on the X-chromosome, causing an X-linked pathology: due to lyonization, female patients usually manifest a variable symptomatology, ranging from asymptomatic to severe phenotypes. The confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of Fabry disease, achieved by measuring α-galactosidase A activity, which is usually the first test used, shows differences between male and female patients. This assay is reliable in male patients with causative mutations in the GLA gene, in whom the enzymatic activity is lower than normal values; on the other hand, in female Fabry patients, the enzymatic activity is extremely variable between normal and pathological values. These fluctuations are also found in female patients' blood levels of globotriaosylsphingosine (LysoGb3) for the same reason. In this paper, we present a retrospective study conducted in our laboratories on 827 Fabry patients with causative mutations in the GLA gene. Our results show that 100% of male patients had α-galactosidase A activity below the reference value, while more than 70% of female patients had normal values. It can also be observed that almost half of the female patients with pathogenic mutations in the GLA gene showed normal values of LysoGb3 in blood. Furthermore, in women, blood LysoGb3 values can vary over time, as we show in a clinical case presented in this paper. Both these tests could lead to missed diagnoses of Fabry disease in female patients, so the analysis of the GLA gene represents the main diagnostic test for Fabry disease in women to date."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, characterised by the cellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide due to impaired alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity. FD may manifest with multisystem pathology, including reduced bone mineral density (BMD). Registry data suggest that the introduction of Fabry-specific therapies (enzyme replacement therapy or chaperone therapy) has led to significant improvements in overall patient outcomes; however, there are limited data on the impact on bone density. The aim of this study was to describe the effect of Fabry-specific therapies on longitudinal changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in FD. We performed a retrospective observational study analysing bone densitometry (DXA) in patients with genetically confirmed FD. Patients were grouped based on the use of Fabry-specific therapies. The between-group longitudinal change in BMD Z-score was analysed using linear mixed effects models. A total of 88 FD patients were analysed (50 untreated; 38 treated). The mean age at first DXA was 38.5 years in the untreated group (84% female) and 43.7 years in the treated group (34% female). There was no significant longitudinal between-group difference in the BMD Z-score at the lumbar spine. However, the Z-score per year at the total hip (β = -0.105, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and femoral neck (β = -0.081, <i>p</i> = 0.001) was significantly lower over time in the treated than the untreated group. This may reflect those receiving therapy having a more severe underlying disease. Nevertheless, this suggests that Fabry-specific therapies do not reverse all disease mechanisms and that the additional management of BMD may be required in this patient population."

The objective of this study is to provide a quantitative, non-invasive demonstration of this phenomenon using quantitative MRI (qMRI). In this retrospective, monocentric cross-sectional study conducted from November 2015 to July 2018, FD patients and healthy controls (HC) underwent an MRI scan with a relaxometry protocol to compute longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) maps to evaluate gray (GM) and white matter (WM) lipid accumulation. In a subgroup of 22 FD patients, clinical (FAbry STabilization indEX -FASTEX- score) and biochemical (residual α-galactosidase activity) variables were correlated with MRI data. Quantitative maps were analyzed at both global (\"bulk\" analysis) and regional (\"voxel-wise\" analysis) levels. Data were obtained from 42 FD patients (mean age = 42.4 ± 12.9, M/F = 16/26) and 49 HC (mean age = 42.3 ± 16.3, M/F = 28/21). Compared to HC, FD patients showed a widespread increase in R1 values encompassing both GM (p<sub>FWE</sub> = 0.02) and WM (p<sub>FWE</sub> = 0.02) structures. While no correlations were found between increased R1 values and FASTEX score, a significant negative correlation emerged between residual enzymatic activity levels and R1 values in GM (r = -0.57, p = 0.008) and WM (r = -0.49, p = 0.03). We demonstrated the feasibility and clinical relevance of non-invasively assessing cerebral Gb3 accumulation in FD using MRI.

Vague clinical symptoms and rarity often mean diagnosis and potential treatment is delayed. Ophthalmic findings in FD patients can be helpful in establishing an early diagnosis and timely treatment. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging in FD patients shows hyper-reflective foci (HRF) in characteristic patterns within the inner retinal layers. We found that the HRF was localised in linear distributions at the deep and superficial borders of the retinal inner nuclear layer, likely reflecting anatomic vascular plexuses and FD-related sphingolipid deposition within the vessel walls.

The New Castle Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. A total of 2141 records were identified through database searches and register searches, amongst which 26 records were screened, and 12 of these were excluded. The remaining 14 reports were sought for retrieval. The 12 retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and their quality was assessed after their inclusion. Amongst the included studies, 5 were of high quality, 6 were of medium quality, and 1 was of low quality.

In this prospective study, 89 Fabry patients were examined using a standardized 3 T MRI protocol of the dorsal root ganglia. Fabry pain was assessed through a validated Fabry pain questionnaire. The genotype was determined by diagnostic sequencing of the alpha-galactosidase A gene. MR imaging end-points were dorsal root ganglia volume by voxel-wise morphometric analysis and dorsal root ganglia T2 signal. Reference groups included 55 healthy subjects and Fabry patients of different genotype categories without Fabry pain. In patients with Fabry pain, T2 signal of the dorsal root ganglia was increased by +39.2% compared to healthy controls (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and by +29.4% compared to painless Fabry disease (<i>P</i> = 0.017).

Cardiac progression was defined as an increase of >10 g/m<sup>2</sup> in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) between the first and the last available follow-up transthoracic echocardiography. 60 patients (35 (23-48) years, 39 (65%) men) were followed up for 10.5 (7.2-12.2) years. 22 had LVH at ERT start (LVMI of 150±38 g/m<sup>2</sup>).

Here, we demonstrate a crucial role of WNT5A/JNK/ROCK signaling that rapidly coordinates the activation of latent TGF-β in fibrotic diseases. WNT5A was identified as a predominant noncanonical WNT ligand in fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis, sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stimulating fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and tissue fibrosis by activation of latent TGF-β. The activation of latent TGF-β requires rapid JNK- and ROCK-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements and integrin αV (ITGAV). Conditional ablation of WNT5A or its downstream targets prevented activation of latent TGF-β, rebalanced TGF-β signaling, and ameliorated experimental fibrosis. We thus uncovered what we believe to be a novel mechanism for the aberrant activation of latent TGF-β in fibrotic diseases and provided evidence for targeting WNT5A/JNK/ROCK signaling in fibrotic diseases as a new therapeutic approach."

To evaluate the birth prevalence of the 6 LSDs in the Shanghai population and determine subclinical forms based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. This cohort study included 50 108 newborns recruited from 41 hospitals in Shanghai between January and December 2021 who were screened for 6 LSDs using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Participants with screen-positive results underwent molecular and biochemical tests and clinical assessments. Data were analyzed from January 2021 through October 2022. All participants were screened for Gaucher, acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), Krabbe, mucopolysaccharidosis type I, Fabry, and Pompe diseases using dried blood spots. Primary outcomes were the birth prevalence and subclinical forms of the 6 LSDs in the Shanghai population. Disease biomarker measurements, genetic testing, and clinical analysis were used to assess clinical forms of LSDs screened. Among 50 108 newborns (26 036 male [52.0%]; mean [SD] gestational age, 38.8 [1.6] weeks), the mean (SD) birth weight was 3257 (487) g. The MS/MS-based NBS identified 353 newborns who were positive. Of these, 27 newborns (7.7%) were diagnosed with 1 of 6 LSDs screened, including 2 newborns with Gaucher, 5 newborns with ASMD, 9 newborns with Krabbe, 8 newborns with Fabry, and 3 newborns with Pompe disease. The combined birth prevalence of LSDs in Shanghai was 1 diagnosis in 1856 live births, with Krabbe disease the most common (1 diagnosis/5568 live births), followed by Fabry disease (1 diagnosis/6264 live births), and ASMD (1 diagnosis/10 022 live births). Biochemical, molecular, and clinical analysis showed that early-onset clinical forms accounted for 3 newborns with positive results (11.1%), while later-onset forms represented nearly 90% of diagnoses (24 newborns [88.9%]). In this study, the combined birth prevalence of the 6 LSDs in Shanghai was remarkably high. MS/MS-based newborn screening, combined with biochemical and molecular genetic analysis, successfully identified and characterized newborns who were screen-positive, which may assist with parental counseling and management decisions."

Our objectives were to measure the prevalence of this complication in a cohort of patients with Fabry disease, and to describe its clinical features. We conducted a retrospective review of Fabry disease patients followed at our tertiary referral center between 1995 and September 2023 with at least one episode of meningitis, and performed a systematic review to identify similar published cases. Four patients out of 107 (3.7%) had at least one episode of aseptic meningitis. Our systematic review identified 25 other observations. The median age of these 29 patients was 29.0 years, the median cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count was 24 cells/mm3 with a predominance of lymphocytes in 64.7% of cases. In 82.8% of the patients, the diagnosis of Fabry disease was unknown before the meningitis. Large artery stenosis was present in 17.2% of patients and 57.1% of patients had a recent stroke concomitant with the meningitis. Several differential diagnoses were evoked, such as multiple sclerosis or central nervous system vasculitis. Our study suggests that Fabry disease should be considered as a cause of aseptic meningitis. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying meningeal inflammation remain largely unknown but may reflect the dysregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways."

    "abstract": "Sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) must be differentiated from phenotypically similar conditions because clinical management and prognosis may greatly differ. Patients with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy require an early, confirmed genetic diagnosis through diagnostic or predictive genetic testing. We tested the feasibility and practicality of the application of a 17-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to detect the most common genetic causes of HCM and HCM phenocopies, including treatable phenocopies, and report detection rates. Identification of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) and Fabry disease (FD) is essential because of the availability of disease-specific therapy. Early initiation of these treatments may lead to better clinical outcomes. In this international, multicenter, cross-sectional pilot study, peripheral dried blood spot samples from patients of cardiology clinics with an unexplained increased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) of ≥13 mm in one or more left ventricular myocardial segments (measured by imaging methods) were analyzed at a central laboratory. NGS included the detection of known splice regions and flanking regions of 17 genes using the Illumina NextSeq 500 and NovaSeq 6000 sequencing systems. Samples for NGS screening were collected between May 2019 and October 2020 at cardiology clinics in Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. Out of 535 samples, 128 (23.9%) samples tested positive for pathogenic/likely pathogenic genetic variants associated with HCM or HCM phenocopies with double pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants detected in four samples. Among the 132 (24.7%) detected variants, 115 (21.5%) variants were associated with HCM and 17 (3.2%) variants with HCM phenocopies. Variants in <i>MYH7</i> (n=60, 11.2%) and <i>MYBPC3</i> (n=41, 7.7%) were the most common HCM variants. The HCM phenocopy variants included variants in the <i>TTR</i> (n=7, 1.3%) and <i>GLA</i> (n=2, 0.4%) genes. The mean (standard deviation) ages of patients with HCM or HCM phenocopy variants, including <i>TTR</i> and <i>GLA</i> variants, were 42.8 (17.9), 54.6 (17.0), and 69.0 (1.4) years, respectively. The overall diagnostic yield of 24.7% indicates that the screening strategy effectively identified the most common forms of HCM and HCM phenocopies among geographically dispersed patients. The results underscore the importance of including ATTR-CA (<i>TTR</i> variants) and FD (<i>GLA</i> variants), which are treatable disorders, in the differential diagnosis of patients with increased LVWT of unknown etiology."

The reliance on imaging techniques often requires the expertise of multiple specialists, including cardiologists, radiologists, and geneticists.

LVH, HCM, and Fabry cardiomyopathy can be differentiated using T1 mapping on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, differentiation between HCM and Fabry cardiomyopathy using echocardiography or MRI cine images is challenging for cardiologists. Our proposed system named the MRI short-axis view left ventricular hypertrophy classifier (MSLVHC) is a high-accuracy standardized imaging classification model developed using AI and trained on MRI short-axis (SAX) view cine images to distinguish between HCM and Fabry disease.

The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 5 years, including heart failure hospitalization, sustained ventricular tachycardia, acute ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. The study included 268 patients (age 50.4 ± 15.4 years, men 46.6%) with Fabry disease (83.2% IVS4+919G > A mutation), and 106 patients (39.6%) had LVH. Patients with mild, moderate, or severe LVH had 5-year MACE rates of 7.4%, 10%, and 30.5%, respectively (P < .001). Moreover, patients with impaired LV GLS (<14.1%) had a higher 5-year MACE rate than those with preserved LV GLS (32.1% vs 2.4%, P < .001). Severe LVH was an independent predictor of MACE compared with absence of LVH (adjusted hazard ratio, 12.73; 95% CI, 1.3-124.71; P = .03), after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, renal function, average E/e', enzyme replacement therapy, and LV GLS. Patients with severe LVH and impaired LV GLS had the highest incidence for MACE (log-rank P < .05), irrespective of sex, genotypes, and whether receiving enzyme replacement therapy or not. Sex-specific grading of LVH by LVMI is practical for risk stratification in patients with Fabry disease, and impaired LV GLS further refines the prognostication."

    "abstract": "To evaluate muscle signal abnormalities on whole-body muscle MRI with T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging in early ALS stages. 101 muscles were analyzed in newly diagnosed ALS patients and healthy controls on a whole-body MRI protocol including four-point T2-Dixon imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging (b0 and b800). Sensitivity and inter-observer agreement were assessed. 15 patients (mean age, 64 +/- 12 [SD], 9 men) who met the Awaji-Shima criteria for definite, probable or possible ALS and 9 healthy controls were assessed (mean age, 53 +/- 13 [SD], 2 men). 61 % of the muscles assessed in ALS patients (62/101) showed signal hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging, mainly in the upper and lower extremities (legs, hands and feet). ALS patients had a significantly higher number of involved muscles compared to healthy controls (p = 0,006). Diffusion-weighted imaging allowed for the detection of additional involvement in 22 muscles, thus improving the sensitivity of whole-body MRI from 60 % (using T2-weighted imaging only) up to 80 % (with the combination of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging). ALS patients exhibited significant muscle signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging in early disease stages. Whole-body MRI could be used for pre-EMG mapping of muscle involvement in order to choose suitable targets, thus improving early diagnosis."

Here, we evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of AL01211 in healthy Chinese volunteers. AL01211 was tested in a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with single-dose (15 and 60 mg) and multiple-dose (30 mg) arms. Results of AL01211 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, rapid absorption (median time to maximum plasma concentration [t<sub>max</sub>] 2.5-4 hours), relatively slow clearance rate (mean apparent total clearance from plasma [CL/F] 88.3-200 L/h) and the mean terminal half-life above 30 hours. Repeated once-daily oral administration of AL01211 for 14 days had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels between 7 and 10 days, and led to a 73% reduction in plasma glucosylceramide (GL1) on Day 14. AL01211 was safe and well tolerated, with no identified serious adverse events. AL01211 showed a favorable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability profile in healthy Chinese volunteers.

We report a case of a 22-year-old male presenting with cochleovestibular disorders as the initial FD manifestation, alongside a literature review. Diagnostic evaluation revealed reduced alpha-galactosidase A activity, confirming FD. Cochleovestibular involvement, although underexplored, significantly affects FD patients, often presenting with sudden deafness or sensorineural hearing loss. Prompt diagnosis and enzyme replacement therapy are crucial for managing FD. Otolaryngologists play a key role in early detection and intervention.

We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to characterize the humanistic (quality of life [QoL]) and economic burden of FD. Searches were conducted in the Embase, MEDLINE<sup>®</sup>, and MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> In-Process databases from inception to January 19, 2022. Conference abstracts of specified congresses were manually searched. Additional searches were performed in the Cochrane and ProQuest databases for the humanistic SLR and the National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database for the economic SLR. Studies of patients with FD of any sex, race, and age, and published in the English language were included. There was no restriction on intervention or comparator. For the humanistic SLR, studies that reported utility data, database/registry-based studies, questionnaires/surveys, and cohort studies were included. For the economic SLR, studies reporting economic evaluations or assessing the cost of illness and resource use were included. Of the 1363 records identified in the humanistic search, 36 studies were included. The most commonly used QoL assessments were the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (n = 16), EQ-5D questionnaire descriptive system or visual analog scale (n = 9), and the Brief Pain Inventory (n = 8). Reduced QoL was reported in patients with FD compared with healthy populations across multiple domains, including pain, physical functioning, and depressive symptoms. Multiple variables-including sex, age, disease severity, and treatment status-impacted QoL. Of the 711 records identified in the economic burden search, 18 studies were included. FD was associated with high cost and healthcare resource use. Contributors to the cost burden included enzyme replacement therapy, healthcare, and social care. In the seven studies that reported health utility values, lower utility scores were generally associated with more complications (including cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular morbidities) and with classical disease in males. FD remains associated with a high cost and healthcare resource use burden, and reduced QoL compared with healthy populations. Integrating information from QoL and economic assessments may help to identify interventions that are likely to be of most value to patients with FD."

This study aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of LVH development in a contemporary cohort of patients with FD and no LVH at baseline evaluation. Consecutively referred adult (aged ≥16 years) patients with FD were enrolled into an observational cohort study. Patients were prospectively followed in a specialist cardiomyopathy centre and the primary endpoint was the first detection of LVH (left ventricular mass index (LVMi) ≥115 g/m<sup>2</sup> in men and ≥95 g/m<sup>2</sup> in women). From a cohort of 393 patients, 214 (aged 35.8±13.8 years; 61 (29%) males) had no LVH at first evaluation. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years (IQR 4.7-12.7), 55 patients (24.6%) developed LVH. The estimated incidence of LVH was 11.3% (95% CI 6.5% to 16.1%) at 5 years, 29.1% (95% CI 21.5% to 36.7%) at 10 years and 45.0% (95% CI 33.8% to 62.4%) at 15 years of follow-up. On multivariable analysis, independent predictors for LVH development were age (HR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) per 1-year increase, p<0.001), male sex (HR 2.90 (95% CI 1.66 to 5.09), p<0.001) and an abnormal ECG (HR 3.10 (95% CI 1.72 to 5.57), p<0.001).

    "abstract": "Fabry disease, a rare X-linked genetic disorder, results from pathogenic variants in <i>GLA</i>, leading to deficient lysosomal α-galactosidase A enzyme activity and multi-organ manifestations. Since 2001, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), using agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta, has been the mainstay treatment, albeit with limitations such as rapid clearance and immunogenicity. Pegunigalsidase alfa, a novel PEGylated recombinant alpha-galactosidase, offers promise as an alternative. Produced in plant cells, pegunigalsidase alfa exhibits enhanced stability, prolonged half-life, and reduced immunogenicity due to pegylation. A phase 1/2 clinical trial demonstrated Gb3 clearance from renal capillary endothelial cells and its 48-month extension study revealed notable outcomes in renal function preservation. Three phase 3 clinical trials (BRIDGE, BRIGHT, and BALANCE) have shown favorable efficacy and safety profile, although caution is warranted in interpreting the results of BRIDGE and BRIGHT which lacked control groups. In BALANCE, the pivotal phase 3 trial comparing pegunigalsidase alfa with agalsidase beta, an intention-to-treat analysis of the eGFR decline over 2 years showed that the intergroup difference [95%confidence interval] in the median slope was -0.36 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year [-2.44; 1.73]. The confidence interval had a lower limit above the prespecified value of -3 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year and included zero. Despite challenges such as occasional hypersensitivity reactions and immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, pegunigalsidase alfa approval by the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration represents a significant addition to Fabry disease therapeutic landscape providing an option for patients in whom enzyme replacement therapy with current formulations is poorly tolerated or poorly effective."

The few reports show controversial information, with both classical and nonclassical Anderson-Fabry Disease (AFD) presentation patterns. The aim of this study was to analyze the penetrance, clinical phenotype, and biochemical profile of an international cohort of patients carrying the p.Arg301Gln genetic variant in the <i>GLA</i> gene. This was an observational, international, and retrospective cohort case series study of patients carrying the p.Arg301Gln variant in the <i>GLA</i> gene associated with AFD disease. Forty-nine p.Arg301Gln <i>GLA</i> carriers, 41% male, were analyzed. The penetrance was 63% in the entire cohort and 1.5 times higher in men. The mean age of symptoms onset was 41 years; compared to women, men presented symptoms earlier and with a shorter delay to diagnosis. The typical clinical triad-cornea verticillate, neuropathic pain, and angiokeratomas-affected only 20% of the cohort, with no differences between genders. During follow-up, almost 20% of the patients presented some type of nonfatal cardiovascular and renal event (stroke, need for dialysis, heart failure, and arrhythmias requiring intracardiac devices), predominantly affecting men. Residual levels were the most common finding of α-GAL A enzyme activity, only a few women had a normal level; a small proportion of men had undetectable levels. The incidence of combined outcomes including all causes of death was 33%, and the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 9% at the follow-up. Patients carrying the p.Arg301Gln <i>GLA</i> variant have a high penetrance, with predominantly cardiorenal involvement and clinical onset of the disease in middle age. Only a small proportion showed the classic clinical presentation of AFD. As in other X-linked diseases, males were more affected by severe cardiovascular and renal events. This genotype-phenotype correlation could be useful from a practical clinical point of view and for future decision making."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a progressive, X chromosome-linked lysosomal storage disorder with multiple organ dysfunction. Due to the absence or reduced activity of alpha-galactosidase A (AGAL), glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosyl-ceramide (Gb3), concentrate in cells. In heterozygous women, symptomatology is heterogenous and currently routinely used fluorometry-based assays measuring mean activity mostly fail to uncover AGAL dysfunction. The aim was the development of a flow cytometry assay to measure AGAL activity in individual cells. Conventional and multispectral imaging flow cytometry was used to detect AGAL activity. Specificity was validated using the <i>GLA</i> knockout (KO) Jurkat cell line and AGAL inhibitor 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin. The <i>GLA</i> KO cell line was generated via CRISPR-Cas9-based transfection, validated with exome sequencing, gene expression and substrate accumulation. Flow cytometric detection of specific AGAL activity is feasible with fluorescently labelled Gb3. In the case of Jurkat cells, a substrate concentration of 2.83 nmol/mL and 6 h of incubation are required. Quenching of the aspecific exofacial binding of Gb3 with 20% trypan blue solution is necessary for the specific detection of lysosomal substrate accumulation. A flow cytometry-based assay was developed for the quantitative detection of AGAL activity at the single-cell level, which may contribute to the diagnosis of Fabry patients."

This genetic mutation triggers glo-botriaosylceramide (Gb-3) buildup within lysosomes, ultimately impairing cellular functions. Given the role of lysosomes in immune cell physiology, FD has been suggested to have a profound impact on immunological responses. During the past years, research has been focusing on this topic, and pooled evidence strengthens the hypothesis that Gb-3 accumulation potentiates the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, revealing the existence of an acute inflammatory process in FD that possibly develops to a chronic state due to stimulus persistency. In parallel, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained attention due to their function as intercellular communicators. Considering EVs' capacity to convey cargo from parent to distant cells, they emerge as potential inflammatory intermediaries capable of transporting cytokines and other immunomodulatory molecules. In this review, we revisit the evidence underlying the association between FD and altered immune responses and explore the potential of EVs to function as inflammatory vehicles."

    "abstract": "Patients with Fabry disease suffer from chronic debilitating pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy with minimal treatment options, but the cellular drivers of this pain are unknown. Here, we propose a mechanism we believe to be novel in which altered signaling between Schwann cells and sensory neurons underlies the peripheral sensory nerve dysfunction we observed in a genetic rat model of Fabry disease. Using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrated that Fabry rat sensory neurons exhibited pronounced hyperexcitability. Schwann cells probably contributed to this finding because application of mediators released from cultured Fabry Schwann cells induced spontaneous activity and hyperexcitability in naive sensory neurons. We examined putative algogenic mediators using proteomic analysis and found that Fabry Schwann cells released elevated levels of the protein p11 (S100A10), which induced sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Removal of p11 from Fabry Schwann cell media caused hyperpolarization of neuronal resting membrane potentials, indicating that p11 may contribute to the excessive neuronal excitability caused by Fabry Schwann cells. These findings demonstrate that sensory neurons from rats with Fabry disease exhibit hyperactivity caused in part by Schwann cell release of the protein p11."

To study the underlying pathomechanism of Fabry-associated small fibre neuropathy, we generated a neuronal <i>in vitro</i> disease model using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells from three Fabry patients and one healthy control. We further generated an isogenic control line via gene editing. We subjected induced pluripotent stem cells to targeted peripheral neuronal differentiation and observed intra-lysosomal globotriaosylceramide accumulations in somas and neurites of Fabry sensory neurons using super-resolution microscopy. At functional level, patch-clamp analysis revealed a hyperpolarizing shift of voltage-gated sodium channel steady-state inactivation kinetics in isogenic control neurons compared with healthy control neurons (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Moreover, we demonstrate a drastic increase in Fabry sensory neuron calcium levels at 39°C mimicking clinical fever (<i>P</i> < 0.001). This pathophysiological phenotype was accompanied by thinning of neurite calibres in sensory neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from Fabry patients compared with healthy control cells (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Linear-nonlinear cascade models fit to spiking responses revealed that Fabry cell lines exhibit altered single neuron encoding properties relative to control. We further observed mitochondrial aggregation at sphingolipid accumulations within Fabry sensory neurites utilizing a click chemistry approach together with mitochondrial dysmorphism compared with healthy control cells. We pioneer pilot insights into the cellular mechanisms contributing to pain, thermal hyposensitivity and denervation in Fabry small fibre neuropathy and pave the way for further mechanistic <i>in vitro</i> studies in Fabry disease and the development of novel treatment approaches."

Our cohort-study in women with Fabry disease shows an increase of pain burden during pregnancies and clearly points to an increased risk for preeclampsia, prematurity, and neonates small for gestational age. With a substantial number of high-risk pregnancies, neonatal outcomes are somewhat worse in Fabry disease than in the general public.

Leucocytes from 41 male patients and 20 controls were analyzed with mass cytometry using both unsupervised and supervised algorithms. FD patients had an increased expression of CD27 and CD28 in memory CD45- and CD45 + CCR7-CD4 T cells (respectively p < 0.014 and p < 0.02). Percentage of CD45RA-CCR7-CD27 + CD28+ cells in CD4 T cells was correlated with plasma lysoGb3 (r = 0.60; p = 0.0036) and phenotype (p < 0.003).

These findings provide valuable insights for understanding FD, linking Gb3 accumulation to inflammation, and proposing new prognostic biomarkers."

We have investigated the potential pathogenicity of these VUS combining clinical data with data obtained in human cellular in vitro systems. We have analyzed four different male subject-derived cell types for alpha-galactosidase A enzyme (GLA) activity and intracellular Gb3 load. Additionally, Gb3 load in skin tissue as well as clinical data were studied for correlates of disease manifestations. A reduction of GLA activity was observed in cells carrying p.A143T compared with controls (p < 0.05). In cells carrying the p.D313Y variant, a reduced GLA activity was found only in endothelial cells (p < 0.01) compared with controls. No pathological changes were observed in cells carrying the p.S126G variant. None of the VUS investigated caused intracellular Gb3 accumulation in any cell type. Our data of aberrant GLA activity in cells of p.A143T hemizygotes and overall normal cellular phenotypes in cells of p.D313Y and p.S126G hemizygotes contribute a basic science perspective to the clinically highly relevant discussion on VUS in GLA."

    "abstract": "Fabry Disease (FD) is a genetic disease caused by a deficiency in the activity of lysosomal galactosidase A (α-GalA), an enzyme responsible for the catabolism of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Since lysosomes are present throughout the body and play a crucial role in catabolism and recycling of cytosolic compounds, FD can affect multiple organs and result in various symptoms, including renal, cardiovascular, neurological, cutaneous, and ophthalmic manifestations. Due to the nonspecific symptoms and the rarity of FD, it is often diagnosed late in life. However, introducing targeted therapies such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and chaperone therapy has significantly improved FD's natural history and prognosis by restoring α-GalA enzyme activity. Despite the advancements, there are limitations to the currently available therapies, which has prompted research into new potential treatments for FD, including alternative forms of enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, mRNA therapy, and genetic therapy. In this review, we analyze the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of FD, with particular emphasis on promising therapeutic opportunities that could shift the treatment of this rare disease from a standardized to a personalized approach soon."

Especially in cases of confirmed diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a low-FODMAP diet can represent an effective approach to improving intestinal manifestations. Furthermore, it is known that some food components, such as polyphenols, may be able to modulate some pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease, such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, the use of healthy dietary patterns should be encouraged in this patient group. Sports practice can be useful for patients with multi-organ involvement, particularly in cardiovascular, renal, and neurological aspects. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the role of nutrition and physical activity in FD patients."

    "title": "Arrhythmogenesis in Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterised by multiorgan accumulation of glycosphingolipid due to deficiency in the enzyme α-galactosidase A. Cardiac sphingolipid accumulation triggers various types of arrhythmias, predominantly ventricular arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, and atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmia is likely the primary contributor to FD mortality with sudden cardiac death, the most frequent cardiac mode of death. Traditionally FD was seen as a storage cardiomyopathy triggering left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and ultimately, systolic dysfunction in advanced disease. The purpose of this review is to outline the current evidence exploring novel mechanisms underlying the arrhythmia substrate. There is growing evidence that FD cardiomyopathy is a primary arrhythmic disease with each stage of cardiomyopathy (accumulation, hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis) contributing to the arrhythmia substrate via various intracellular, extracellular, and environmental mechanisms. It is therefore important to understand how these mechanisms contribute to an individual's risk of arrhythmia in FD. In this review, we outline the epidemiology of arrhythmia, pathophysiology of arrhythmogenesis, risk stratification, and cardiac therapy in FD. We explore how advances in conventional cardiac investigations performed in FD patients including 12-lead electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have enabled early detection of pro-arrhythmic substrate. This has allowed for appropriate risk stratification of FD patients. This paves the way for future work exploring the development of therapeutic initiatives and risk prediction models to reduce the burden of arrhythmia."

    "title": "Patient-reported experience with Fabry disease and its management in the real-world setting: results from a double-blind, cross-sectional survey of 280 respondents.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with a heterogeneous clinical presentation. Patients with FD may exhibit early signs/symptoms including neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal complaints, and dermatologic manifestations. FD may ultimately progress to renal, neurologic, and cardiac dysfunction. Current treatments for FD have significantly improved the management and outcomes for patients with FD, but important clinical and convenience limitations still exist. To illuminate the impact of FD on daily life from the patient's perspective, we asked adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with FD in the United States and Canada to complete a 33-question online survey to assess patient-reported disease severity, management, and treatment outcomes. A total of 280 respondents with FD completed the survey; they had a mean age of 47 years, and 68% (191/280) were women. Most were currently receiving FD treatment (84%, 234/280) with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (89%, 208/234) or chaperone therapy (11%, 26/234). Common symptoms included low energy/fatigue (72%, 201/280), tingling (62%, 174/280) or pain in the hands/feet (60%, 168/280), ringing in ears/hearing loss (54%, 151/280), general body pains/pain crises (51%, 143/280), and abdominal/stomach pain (50%, 140/280). More than half (51%, 144/280) of respondents reported their symptoms as bothersome (38%, 106/280) or difficult to control (14%, 38/280). Temporary symptom worsening between infusions was reported by about half of respondents: 51% (108/211) currently receiving ERT and 48% (14/29) previously receiving ERT. Only 48% (59/122) of respondents reported their symptom worsening to their physician. Of those who reported it, 41% (24/59) said that their physician prescribed medication to manage their symptoms or changed their treatment regimen. Our analysis highlights the gap between current standard-of-care in disease monitoring and patient perception of disease progression among patients with FD. This information may be helpful for healthcare providers and drug developers seeking to improve the care of patients with FD by addressing unmet needs of high relevance."

    "abstract": "As a standard therapy for Fabry disease, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human α-galactosidase A (α-Gal) has been successfully used, and the instructions for this drug state that \"it should not be co-administrated with cationic amphiphilic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and amiodarone (AMI), since these drugs have the potential to inhibit intracellular α-Gal activity\". However, there would be cases in which HCQ or AMI is required for patients with Fabry disease, considering their medical efficacy and application. Thus, we examined the impact of HCQ/AMI on recombinant human α-Gal by <i>in vitro</i>, cellular, and animal experiments. The results revealed that HCQ/AMI affected the enzyme activity of α-Gal incorporated into cultured fibroblasts from a Fabry mouse when the cells were cultured in medium containing these drugs and the enzyme, although their direct inhibitory effect on the enzyme is not strong. These lysosomotropic drugs may be trapped and concentrated in lysosomes, followed by inhibition of α-Gal. On the other hand, no reduction of α-Gal activity incorporated into the organs and tissues, or acceleration of glycoshingolipid accumulation was observed in Fabry mice co-administered with HCQ/AMI and the enzyme, compared with in the case of usual ERT. As HCQ/AMI administered are catabolized in the liver, these drugs possibly do not affect ERT for Fabry mice, different from in the case of cultured cells in an environment isolated from the surroundings."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder of X-linked inheritance. Mutations in the α-galactosidase A gene lead to cellular globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) depositions and triggerable acral burning pain in both sexes as an early FD symptom of unknown pathophysiology. We aimed at elucidating the link between skin cells and nociceptor sensitization contributing to FD pain in a sex-associated manner. We used cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts of 27 adult FD patients and 20 healthy controls. Epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were cultured and immunoreacted to evaluate Gb3 load. Gene expression analysis of pain-related ion channels and pro-inflammatory cytokines was performed in dermal fibroblasts. We further investigated electrophysiological properties of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived sensory-like neurons of a man with FD and a healthy man and incubated the cells with interleukin 8 (IL-8) or fibroblast supernatant as an in vitro model system. Keratinocytes displayed no intracellular, but membrane-bound Gb3 deposits. In contrast, fibroblasts showed intracellular Gb3 and revealed higher gene expression of potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3.1 (KCa 3.1, KCNN4) in both, men and women with FD compared to controls. Additionally, cytokine expression analysis showed increased IL-8 RNA levels only in female FD fibroblasts. Patch-clamp studies revealed reduced rheobase currents for both iPSC neuron cell lines incubated with IL-8 or fibroblast supernatant of women with FD. We conclude that Gb3 deposition in female FD patient skin fibroblasts may lead to increased KCa3.1 activity and IL-8 secretion. This may result in cutaneous nociceptor sensitization as a potential mechanism contributing to a sex-associated FD pain phenotype."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) results from a lack of activity of the lysosomal enzyme α-Galactosidase A (α-Gal A), leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in several different cell types. Protein supplementation by pDNA or mRNA delivery presents a promising strategy to tackle the underlying genetic defect in FD. Protein-coding nucleic acids in FD can be either delivered to the most affected sites by the disease, including heart, kidney and brain, or to specialized organs that can act as a production factory of the enzyme, such as the liver. Lipid-based systems are currently at the top of the ranking of non-viral nucleic acid delivery systems, and their versatility allows the linking to the surface of a wide range of molecules to control their biodistribution after intravenous administration. This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines and provides an overview and discussion of the targeting ligands that have been employed so far to actively vectorize intravenously administered non-viral vectors based on lipid carriers to clinically relevant organs in the treatment of FD, for protein-coding nucleic acid (pDNA and mRNA) supplementation. Among the thirty-two studies included, the majority focus on targeting the liver and brain. The targeting of the heart has been reported to a lesser degree, whereas no articles addressing kidney-targeting have been recorded. Although a great effort has been made to develop organ-specific nucleic acid delivery systems, the design of active-targeted carriers with high quality, good clinical translation, and large-scale manufacturing capacity is still challenging."

The left and right atrial inner diameters were large, and the ventricular wall was thick. Gene analysis which showed GLA c.215T>C p.Met72Thr mutation and single photon emission computed tomography indicated the diagnosis of FD with coronary microvascular dysfunction. The patient was prescribed anti-heart failure drugs, including vericiguat.

This review presents the clinical and laboratory results achieved with agalsidase alfa, which has been published in the literature. Agalsidase alfa infusion slows down or stops the progression of renal damage, expressed by reduction or stabilization of the annual decline of the glomerular filtration rate; yearly decrease of glomerular filtration rate (slope) sometimes is reduced until its stabilization. ERT prevents or reduces the occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or slows the increase over time if it is already present. Moreover, regarding neurological manifestations, ERT improves neuropathic pain and quality of life, and recent data indicated that it may also prevent the burden of cerebrovascular disease. In addition to ERT's clinical benefits, crucial topics like the most appropriate time to start therapy and the role of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are analyzed. Treatment with agalsidase alfa in patients with FD substantially improves their outcomes and enhances their quality of life in patients with FD."

This study aimed to determine the impact of different grades of mrEMVI and their disappearance after neoadjuvant therapy. A Dutch national retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted, including patients who underwent resection for rectal cancer in 2016 from 60/69 hospitals performing rectal surgery. Patients with a cT3-4 tumour ≤8 cm from the anorectal junction were selected and their MRI-scans were reassessed by trained abdominal radiologists. Positive mrEMVI grades (3 and 4) were analyzed in regard to 4-year local recurrence (LR), DM, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The 1213 included patients had a median follow-up of 48 months (IQR 30-54). Positive mrEMVI was present in 324 patients (27%); 161 had grade 3 and 163 had grade 4. A higher mrEMVI stage (grade 4 vs grade 3 vs no mrEMVI) increased LR-risk (21% vs 18% vs 7%, <0.001) and DM-risk (49% vs 30% vs 21%, p < 0.001) and decreased DFS (42% vs 55% vs 69%, p < 0.001) and OS (62% vs 76% vs 81%, p < 0.001), which remained independently associated in multivariable analysis. When mrEMVI had disappeared on restaging MRI, DM-rate was comparable to initial absence of mrEMVI (both 26%), whereas LR-rate remained high (22% vs 9%, p = 0.006). The negative oncological impact of mrEMVI on recurrence and survival rates was dependent on grading. Disappearance of mrEMVI on restaging MRI decreased the risk of DM, but not of LR."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a multisystemic disorder characterized by deposition of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form in multiple organs, sometimes localized in specific systems such as the nervous or cardiovascular system. As disease-modifying therapies are now available, early diagnosis is paramount to improving life quality and clinical outcomes. Despite the widespread use of non-invasive techniques for assessing organ damage, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with cardiac disease, organ biopsy remains the gold standard to assess organ involvement. The cases of two patients, father and daughter with a W162C mutation, are described. The father presented with late-onset, cardiac Fabry disease, subsequently developing systolic dysfunction and heart failure. His daughter, while asymptomatic and with normal cardiac assessment (except for slightly reduced native T1 values by cardiac MRI), had already initial myocyte Gb3 deposits on the endomyocardial biopsy, allowing her to start therapy precociously and potentially modifying the course of her disease. A review of the literature concerning the W162C mutation is then provided, showing that it is usually associated to classic, multisystemic Fabry disease rather than the cardiac-restricted form as in these two cases. Three main points can be concluded from this report. First, the W162C mutation can present with a more variegate phenotype than that predicted on a molecular basis. Second, endomyocardial biopsy was shown in this case to precede non-invasive investigation in determining organ involvement, justifying further studies on this potentially reliable technique, Third, difficulties can arise in the management of asymptomatic female carriers."

    "abstract": "The limited ability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in removing globotriaosylceramide from cardiomyocytes is recognized for advanced Fabry disease cardiomyopathy (FDCM). Prehypertrophic FDCM is believed to be cured or stabilized by ERT. However, no pathologic confirmation is available. We report here on the long-term clinical-pathologic impact of ERT on prehypertrophic FDCM. Fifteen patients with Fabry disease with left ventricular maximal wall thickness ≤10.5 mm at cardiac magnetic resonance required endomyocardial biopsy because of angina and ventricular arrhythmias. Endomyocardial biopsy showed coronary small-vessel disease in the angina cohort, and vacuoles in smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes ≈20% of the cell surface containing myelin bodies at electron microscopy. Patients received α-agalsidase in 8 cases, and β-agalsidase in 7 cases. Both groups experienced symptom improvement except 1 patients treated with α-agalsidase and 1 treated with β-agalsidase. After ERT administration ranging from 4 to 20 years, all patients had control cardiac magnetic resonance and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy because of persistence of symptoms or patient inquiry on disease resolution. In 13 asymptomatic patients with FDCM, left ventricular maximal wall thickness and left ventricular mass, cardiomyocyte diameter, vacuole surface/cell surface ratio, and vessels remained unchanged or minimally increased (left ventricular mass increased by <2%) even after 20 years of observation, and storage material was still present at electron microscopy. In 2 symptomatic patients, FDCM progressed, with larger and more engulfed by globotriaosylceramide myocytes being associated with myocardial virus-negative lymphocytic inflammation. ERT stabilizes storage deposits and myocyte dimensions in 87% of patients with prehypertrophic FDCM. Globotriaosylceramide is never completely removed even after long-term treatment. Immune-mediated myocardial inflammation can overlap, limiting ERT activity."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked disorder resulting from dysfunction of α-galactosidase A, can result in significant complications. Early intervention yields better outcomes, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common, impacting prognosis. Thus, early detection is crucial in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of FD. While newborn screening for FD has been implemented in certain regions, challenges persist in enzyme activity detection techniques, particularly for female and late-onset patients. Further exploration of improved screening strategies is warranted. This study retrospectively analyzed genetic screening results for pathogenic GLA variants in 17,171 newborns. The results indicated an estimated incidence of FD in the Nanjing region of China of approximately 1 in 1321. The most prevalent pathogenic variant among potential FD patients was c.640-801G > A (46.15 %). Furthermore, the residual enzyme activity of the pathogenic variant c.911G > C was marginally higher than that of other variants, and suggesting that genetic screening may be more effective in identifying potential female and late-onset patients compared to enzyme activity testing. This research offers initial insights into the effectiveness of GLA genetic screening and serves as a reference for early diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling in FD."

    "abstract": "While neurological manifestations are core features of Fabry disease (FD), quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers allowing to measure brain involvement are lacking. We used deep learning and the brain-age paradigm to assess whether FD patients' brains appear older than normal and to validate brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) as a possible disease severity biomarker. MRI scans of FD patients and healthy controls (HCs) from a single Institution were, retrospectively, studied. The Fabry stabilization index (FASTEX) was recorded as a measure of disease severity. Using minimally preprocessed 3D T1-weighted brain scans of healthy subjects from eight publicly available sources (N = 2160; mean age = 33 years [range 4-86]), we trained a model predicting chronological age based on a DenseNet architecture and used it to generate brain-age predictions in the internal cohort. Within a linear modeling framework, brain-PAD was tested for age/sex-adjusted associations with diagnostic group (FD vs. HC), FASTEX score, and both global and voxel-level neuroimaging measures. We studied 52 FD patients (40.6 ± 12.6 years; 28F) and 58 HC (38.4 ± 13.4 years; 28F). The brain-age model achieved accurate out-of-sample performance (mean absolute error = 4.01 years, R<sup>2</sup> = .90). FD patients had significantly higher brain-PAD than HC (estimated marginal means: 3.1 vs. -0.1, p = .01). Brain-PAD was associated with FASTEX score (B = 0.10, p = .02), brain parenchymal fraction (B = -153.50, p = .001), white matter hyperintensities load (B = 0.85, p = .01), and tissue volume reduction throughout the brain. We demonstrated that FD patients' brains appear older than normal. Brain-PAD correlates with FD-related multi-organ damage and is influenced by both global brain volume and white matter hyperintensities, offering a comprehensive biomarker of (neurological) disease severity."

    "abstract": "Fabry nephropathy is a consequence of the deposition of globotriaosylceramide, caused by deficient GLA enzyme activity in all types of kidney cells. These deposits are perceived as damage signals leading to activation of inflammation resulting in renal fibrosis. There are few studies related to immunophenotype characterization of the renal infiltrate in kidneys in patients with Fabry disease and its relationship to mechanisms of fibrosis. This work aims to quantify TGF-β1 and active caspase 3 expression and to analyze the profile of cells in inflammatory infiltration in kidney biopsies from Fabry naïve-patients, and to investigate correlations with clinical parameters. Renal biopsies from 15 treatment-naïve Fabry patients were included in this study. Immunostaining was performed to analyze active caspase 3, TGF-β1, TNF-α, CD3, CD20, CD68 and CD163. Clinical data were retrospectively gathered at time of kidney biopsy. Our results suggest the production of TNFα and TGFβ1 by tubular cells, in Fabry patients. Active caspase 3 staining revealed that tubular cells are in apoptosis, and apoptotic levels correlated with clinical signs of chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, and inversely with glomerular filtration rate. The cell infiltrates consisted of macrophages, T and B cells. CD163 macrophages were found in biopsy specimens and their number correlates with TGFβ1 and active caspase 3 tubular expression. These results suggest that CD163<sup>+</sup> cells could be relevant mediators of fibrosis in Fabry nephropathy, playing a role in the induction of TGFβ1 and apoptotic cell death by tubular cells. These cells may represent a new player in the pathogenic mechanisms of Fabry nephropathy."

This article describes one of the few examples of national RSAs. Enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) were introduced in Canada to treat Fabry disease in the early 2000s through an RSA. Based on qualitative interviews with key participating actors, this article explains how this RSA ensured continuity of treatment for patients already on ERT, and collected robust real-world evidence to secure treatment for future Fabry patients. We show the importance of partnerships, collaborations, and active patient communities in establishing RSAs, as well as the critical role of robust registries for the collection, storage, and use of that real-world data. In doing so, this paper points to reasons that explain the relative dearth of RSAs in Canada, which can be resource (both human and finance) intensive and are difficult to broker in a federalist health system. Through these findings, policy lessons are developed concerning the need for technological and governance platforms on how RSA in Canada can be more effectively supported going forward in a broader move towards \"social pharmaceutical innovation\"."

The patient, a woman in her 40s, required postoperative irradiation for left breast cancer (pT1N0M0). There were several patients with Fabry disease in her family, and the diagnosis of Fabry disease was made five years ago. Cardiac function evaluation revealed no significant abnormalities, but a myocardial biopsy had suggested the presence of Fabry disease. Due to the relatively preserved distance between the heart and the chest wall, the patient received heart-shielded three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy at a dose of 53.2 Gy in 20 fractions, without the use of deep-inspiration breath-hold or intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

Up to 1% of patients with a diagnosis of HCM indeed have AFD. With the availability of targeted therapies for sarcomeric HCM and its genocopies, a timely differential diagnosis is essential. Specifically, the therapeutic landscape for AFD is rapidly evolving and offers increasingly effective, disease-modifying treatment options. However, diagnosing AFD may be difficult, particularly in the non-classic phenotype with prominent or isolated cardiac involvement and no systemic red flags. For many AFD patients, the clinical journey from initial clinical manifestations to diagnosis and appropriate treatment remains challenging, due to late recognition or utter neglect. Consequently, late initiation of treatment results in an exacerbation of cardiac involvement, representing the main cause of morbidity and mortality, irrespective of gender. Optimal management of AFD patients requires a dedicated multidisciplinary team, in which the cardiologist plays a decisive role, ranging from the differential diagnosis to the prevention of complications and the evaluation of timing for disease-specific therapies. The present review aims to redefine the role of cardiologists across the main decision nodes in contemporary AFD clinical care and drug discovery."

A total of 212 EMBs obtained in 178 consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed, with 42 biopsies performed for allograft rejection surveillance (10 patients) and the remaining performed for presumptive diagnosis of acute myocarditis or unexplained cardiomyopathy. Among the non-heart transplant cases, 54.7% of EMBs provided a clear diagnosis. The most common diagnosis was myocarditis (69%), followed by cardiac amyloidosis (CA) (26%). EMB was also helpful in detecting several rare cardiac conditions, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), Fabry disease, and cardiac sarcoidosis. In a cohort of 101 patients who underwent both CMR and EMB, the results were concordant in 66% of cases. However, in 24.7% of patients, EMB was able to identify pathological conditions where CMR results were inconclusive, highlighting its complementary role in determining an accurate diagnosis. No complications were reported in any of the 212 EMBs performed. With advances in cardiac imaging modalities, EMB is not routinely indicated for the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. However, EMB is still an important tool for diagnosing specific cardiac diseases and could be crucial for confirming the diagnosis. EMB is generally safe if performed at experienced centers."

    "title": "<i>GLA</i> Mutations Suppress Autophagy and Stimulate Lysosome Generation in Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked recessive inheritance lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene leading to a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). Multiple organ systems are implicated in FD, most notably the kidney, heart, and central nervous system. In our previous study, we identified four <i>GLA</i> mutations from four independent Fabry disease families with kidney disease or neuropathic pain: c.119C>A (p.P40H), c.280T>C (C94R), c.680G>C (p.R227P) and c.801+1G>A (p.L268fsX3). To reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the predisposition to Fabry disease caused by <i>GLA</i> mutations, we analyzed the effects of these four <i>GLA</i> mutations on the protein structure of α-galactosidase A using bioinformatics methods. The results showed that these mutations have a significant impact on the internal dynamics and structures of GLA, and all these altered amino acids are close to the enzyme activity center and lead to significantly reduced enzyme activity. Furthermore, these mutations led to the accumulation of autophagosomes and impairment of autophagy in the cells, which may in turn negatively regulate autophagy by slightly increasing the phosphorylation of mTOR. Moreover, the overexpression of these GLA mutants promoted the expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), resulting in an increased number of lysosomes. Our study reveals the pathogenesis of these four <i>GLA</i> mutations in FD and provides a scientific foundation for accurate diagnosis and precise medical intervention for FD."

Here, we investigated a 49-year old man with cryptogenic lacunar cerebral stroke and the chance finding of the VUS S126G, who was sent to our center for diagnosis and initiation of a costly and life-long FD-specific treatment. We combined clinical examination with <i>in vitro</i> investigations of dermal fibroblasts (HDF), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and iPSC-derived sensory neurons. We analyzed α-GAL A activity in iPSC, Gb3 accumulation in all three cell types, and action potential firing in sensory neurons. Neurological examination and small nerve fiber assessment was normal except for reduced distal skin innervation. S126G iPSC showed normal α-GAL A activity compared to controls and no Gb3 deposits were found in all three cell types. Baseline electrophysiological characteristics of S126G neurons showed no difference compared to healthy controls as investigated by patch-clamp recordings. We pioneer multi-level cellular characterization of the VUS S126G using three cell types derived from a patient and provide further evidence for the benign nature of S126G in <i>GLA</i>, which is of great importance in the management of such cases in clinical practice."

    "title": "Infertility in Fabry's Disease: role of hypoxia and inflammation in determining testicular damage.",
    "abstract": "Fabry's disease (FD) is a genetic X-linked systemic and progressive rare disease characterized by the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GB3) into the lysosomes of many tissues. FD is due to loss-of-function mutations of α-galactosidase, a key-enzyme for lysosomal catabolism of glycosphingolipids, which accumulate as glycolipid bodies (GB). In homozygous males the progressive deposition of GB3 into the cells leads to clinical symptoms in CNS, skin, kidney, etc. In testis GB accumulation causes infertility and alterations of spermatogenesis. However, the precise damaging mechanism is still unknown. Our hypothesis is that GB accumulation reduces blood vessel lumen and increases the distance of vessels from both stromal cells and seminiferous parenchyma; this, in turn, impairs oxygen and nutrients diffusion leading to subcellular degradation of seminiferous epithelium and sterility. To test this hypothesis, we have studied a 42-year-old patient presenting a severe FD and infertility, with reduced number of spermatozoa, but preserved sexual activity. Testicular biopsies were analyzed by optical (OM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Activation and cellular localization of HIF-1α and NFκB was analyzed by immunofluorescence (IF) and RT-PCR on homogeneous tissue fractions after laser capture microdissection (LCMD). OM and TEM showed that GB were abundant in vessel wall cells and in interstitial cells. By contrast, GB were absent in seminiferous epithelium, Sertoli's and Leydig's cells. However, seminiferous tubular epithelium and Sertoli's cells showed reduced diameter, thickening of basement membrane and tunica propria, and swollen or degenerated spermatogonia. IF showed an accumulation of HIF-1α in stromal cells but not in seminiferous tubules. On the contrary, NFκB fluorescence was evident in tubules, but very low in interstitial cells. Finally, RT-PCR analysis on LCMD fractions showed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes connected to the HIF-1α/NFκB inflammatory-like pathway. Our study demonstrates that infertility in FD may be caused by reduced oxygen and nutrients due to GB accumulation in blood vessels cells. Reduced oxygen and nutrients alter HIF-1α/NFκB expression and localization while activating HIF-1α/NFκB driven-inflammation-like response damaging seminiferous tubular epithelium and Sertoli's cells."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are predominantly enzyme deficiencies leading to substrate accumulation, causing progressive damage to multiple organs. To date, a crucial part of diagnosing LSDs is measuring enzymatic activity in leucocytes, plasma, or dried blood spots (DBS). Here, we present results from a proof-of-principle study, evaluating an innovative digital microfluidics (DMF) platform, referred to as SEEKER®, that can measure the activity of the following four lysosomal enzymes from DBS: α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), acid α-glucosidase (GAA) for Pompe disease, β-glucosidase (GBA) for Gaucher disease, and α-galactosidase A (GLA) for Fabry disease. Over 900 DBS were analysed from newborns, children, and adults. DMF successfully detected known patients with MPS I, Pompe disease, and Gaucher disease, and known males with Fabry disease. This is the first demonstration of this multiplexed DMF platform for identification of patients with LSDs in a specialised diagnostic enzyme laboratory environment. We conclude that this DMF platform is relatively simple, high-throughput, and could be readily accommodated into a specialised laboratory as a first-tier test for MPS I, Pompe disease, and Gaucher disease for all patients, and Fabry disease for male patients only."

Of 2102 biochemically diagnosed LSDs cases, 32 adult patients were identified with LSDs. Based on the clinical suspicion, screening test and enzyme study was carried out. Twenty-two patients were subjected to a genetic study to identify the causative variant in a respective gene. Of the 32 adult patients, we observed a maximum percentage of 37.5% (<i>n</i> = 12) cases with Gaucher disease, followed by 13% (<i>n</i> = 4) with Fabry disease. We found 10% of cases with MPS IVA and MPS I, and 9% cases with Pompe.

We observed two common variants p.Leu483Pro and p.Ala487Thr in the <i>GBA1</i> gene in 23% of Indian patients with adult Gaucher disease. No common variants were observed in other aforementioned LSDs. Study identified 50% of Fabry patients and 4% of Gaucher patients diagnosed at our centre to be adults. The prevalence of adult Pompe patients was low (3.4%) as compared to 80% reported in the Caucasian population.

    "abstract": "Kidney damage is common in patients with Fabry disease (FD), but more accurate information about the risk of progression to kidney failure is needed for clinical decision-making. In particular, FD patients with mild renal involvement often lack timely intervention and treatment. We aimed to utilize a model to predict the risk of renal progression in FD patients. Between November 2011 and November 2019, ERT-naive patients with FD were recruited from three medical centers in China. To assess the risk of a 50% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), Cox proportional hazards models were utilized. The performance of these models was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and reclassification. A total of 117 individuals were enrolled. The mean follow-up time was 4.8 years, during which 35 patients (29.9 %) progressed to the composite renal outcomes. Male sex, baseline proteinuria, eGFR and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) were found to be independent risk factors for kidney progression by the Cox model, based on which a combined model containing those clinical variables and Lyso-Gb3 and clinical models including only clinical indicators were constructed. The two prediction models had relatively good performance, with similar model fit measured by R<sup>2</sup> (59.8 % vs. 61.1 %) and AIC (51.54 vs. 50.08) and a slight increase in the C statistic (0.949 vs. 0.951). Calibration curves indicated closer alignment between predicted and actual renal outcomes in the combined model. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that Lyso-Gb3 significantly improved the predictive performance of the combined model for kidney prognosis in low-risk patients with a baseline eGFR over 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or proteinuria levels less than 1 g/d when compared to the clinical model. Lyso-Gb3 improves the prediction of kidney outcomes in FD patients with a low risk of progression, suggesting that these patients may benefit from early intervention to assist in clinical management.

To date, no studies have examined the relative risk of peripheral vestibular disorder in patients with Fabry disease compared to the general population without the condition. Due to the high prevalence of Fabry disease in East Asia and the potential shared pathogenic pathways between Fabry disease and vasculopathy, we conducted a study using a nationwide population-based dataset to compare the prevalence of peripheral vestibular disorder between patients with Fabry disease and matched comparison patients. Data was sourced from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010. this study consists of 11,668 sampled patients, 2917 study patients with Fabry disease and 8751 propensity-score-matching comparison patients. We conducted multiple logistic regression analysis to study the association between peripheral vestibular disorder and Fabry disease. The study identified notable differences in the prevalence of various vestibular disorders between the study and comparison groups. Specifically, there was a 7.2% increased prevalence of peripheral vestibular disorder in the study group (28.3%) compared to the comparison group (20.9%), Meniere's disease (5.4% vs. 3.7%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (5.1% vs. 3.3%), and other/ unspecified peripheral vestibular dizziness (15.6% vs. 11.8%) (all p < 0.001). The odds ratios for PVD, MD, BPPV, and other PVD were 1.44 (95% CI = 1.29-1.60), 1.50 (95% CI = 1.23-1.83), 1.59 (95% CI = 1.30-1.95), and 1.40 (95% CI = 1.24-1.58), respectively, among the Fabry disease group relative to the comparison group after adjusting for age, monthly income, geographic location, urbanization level, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.

We explored the clinical implications of this proband and examined the deleteriousness and conservation of the mutation site through bioinformatics analysis. Simultaneously, we collected the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the affected patient, then reprogrammed them into iPSCs and assessed their enzymatic activity to confirm the function of lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). Clinical examination of the patient demonstrated a classical FD, such as neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, deficiency of α-Gal A activity and accumulation of Lyso-Gb-3. The novel mutation located on the N-terminal region, leading to a truncation of the protein and remaining only 24 amino acids. The α-Gal A activity of the patient-specific iPSC (iPS-FD) was significantly lower (60%) than that of normal iPSCs derived from healthy donors (iPS-B1). This work not only elucidated the etiology of novel mutations in affected patients but also highlighted the utility of iPSCs as a valuable tool for clarifying the molecular mechanisms and providing new insights into the therapy of FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is caused by α-galactosidase A (AGA) deficiency, which ultimately leads to the intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Exosomes play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by clearing damaged or toxic materials, including proteins. In the process of excessive accumulation of intracellular Gb3 in Fabry disease, it may be suggested that exosomal secretion of Gb3 increases to preserve cell homeostasis. This study sought to determine how exosomal secretion and cell signaling change in an FD cell model produced by gene silencing. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids carrying shRNA against the GLA gene to produce the FD cell model. A recombinant AGA, agalsidase-beta, was used to evaluate the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on exosomal secretion and cell signaling. Exosome secretion was significantly increased in the Fabry disease cell model compared to the control vector cell model, and significantly decreased after agalsidase-beta treatment. The FD cell model showed higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p53 protein expression compared to the control vector cell model. Increased exosomal secretion in Fabry disease may be a cellular mechanism to avoid excessive and cytotoxic accumulation of Gb3 in lysosomes through intracellular signaling, including increased p53 expression."

Early diagnosis and the prediction of disease course are complicated by the clinical heterogeneity of FD, as well as by the frequently inconclusive biochemical and genetic test results that do not correlate with clinical course. We sought to identify potential biomarkers of FD to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and clinical phenotypes. We compared the plasma proteomes of 50 FD patients and 50 matched healthy controls using DDA and SWATH-MS. The >30 proteins that were differentially expressed between the 2 groups included proteins implicated in processes such as inflammation, heme and haemoglobin metabolism, oxidative stress, coagulation, complement cascade, glucose and lipid metabolism, and glycocalyx formation. Stratification by sex revealed that certain proteins were differentially expressed in a sex-dependent manner. Apolipoprotein A-IV was upregulated in FD patients with complications, especially those with chronic kidney disease, and apolipoprotein C-III and fetuin-A were identified as possible markers of FD with left ventricular hypertrophy. All these proteins had a greater capacity to identify the presence of complications in FD patients than lyso-GB3, with apolipoprotein A-IV standing out as being more sensitive and effective in differentiating the presence and absence of chronic kidney disease in FD patients than renal markers such as creatinine, glomerular filtration rate and microalbuminuria. Identification of these potential biomarkers can help further our understanding of the pathophysiological processes that underlie the heterogeneous clinical manifestations associated with FD."

However, whether the introduction of LNP-encapsulated mRNA results in the alteration of metabolomics in an in vivo system remains largely unknown. In the present study, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) mRNA was generated and injected into the Fabry disease mouse model. The α-Gal A protein was successfully expressed. The level of globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3), a biomarker for Fabry disease, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were greatly decreased compared to the untreated control, indicating the therapeutic outcome of the mRNA drug. Metabolomics analysis found that the level of 20 metabolites was significantly altered in the plasma of mRNA-injected mice. These compounds are primarily enriched in the arachidonic acid metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways. Arachidonic acid and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), both of which are important components in the eicosanoid pathway and related to inflammation response, were significantly increased in the injected mice, possibly due to the presence of lipid nanoparticles. Moreover, mRNA can effectively alter the level of metabolites in the amino acid and energy metabolic pathways that are commonly found to be suppressed in Fabry disease. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that in addition to supplementing the deficient α-Gal A protein, the mRNA-based therapeutic agent can also affect levels of metabolites that may help in the recovery of metabolic homeostasis in the full body system."

Gene therapy is a promising strategy that can overcome these problems, and virus vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) have been used for study on gene therapy. We used human Gb3 synthetase-transgenic (TgG3S)/α-Gal A knockout (GLAko) mice. TgG3S/GLAko mice have elevated Gb3 accumulation in the major organs compared with GLAko mice, which have been widely used as a model for FD. At the age of 6 weeks, male TgG3S/GLAko were injected with 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vector genome AAV9 vectors containing human α-Gal A cDNA. Eight weeks after intravenous injection of AAV, α-Gal A enzymatic activity was elevated in the plasma, heart, and liver of TgG3S/GLAko mice to levels corresponding to 224%, 293%, and 105% of wild-type, respectively. Gb3 amount 8 weeks after AAV injection in the heart and liver of this group was successfully reduced to levels corresponding to 16% and 3% of untreated TgG3S/GLAko mice. Although the brain and kidney of AAV9-treated TgG3S/GLAko mice showed no significant increases in α-Gal A activity, Gb3 amount was smaller than untreated littermates (48% and 44%, respectively). In this study, systemic AAV administration did not show significant extension of the lifespan of TgG3S/GLAko mice compared with the untreated littermates. The timing of AAV injection, capsid choice, administration route, and injection volume may be important to achieve sufficient expression of α-Gal A in the whole body for the amelioration of lifespan."

In this prospective study, a total of 114 patients (31 FD and 83 TTR CA) were included; all of them had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), defined as left ventricular (LV) wall thickness ≥ 12 mm. Despite similar degree of LVH, patients with TTR CA showed worse LV systolic and diastolic function. LA maximal volume index was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.084), while patients with TTR CA showed larger LA minimal volume index (p = 0.001). Moreover, all phases of LA mechanics were more impaired in the TTR CA group vs FD (reservoir: 6.9[4.2-15.5] vs 19.0[15.5-29.5], p < 0.001). After excluding patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), these differences remained clearly significant. In multivariable regression analyses, LA reservoir strain showed an independent correlation with TTR CA, controlling for demographic characteristics, AF and LV systolic and diastolic performance (p ≤ 0.001), whereas LV global longitudinal strain did not. Finally, among echocardiographic parameters, LA function demonstrated the highest accuracy in discriminating the two diseases. TTR CA is characterized by a more advanced LA structural and functional remodelling in comparison to patients with FD and similar degree of LVH. The association between TTR CA and LA dysfunction remains consistent after adjustment for potential confounders."

VEGFα expression was visualized by an immunohistochemical staining of paraffin aortic rings. In addition, VEGFα and angiostatin serum levels were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 48 patients with genetically verified Fabry's disease (50% male) and 22 healthy controls and correlated with disease severity markers such as lyso-Gb3, albuminuria, NTproBNP, high-sensitive troponin T (hsTNT), and myocardial wall thickness. It was found that there was a significant increase in VEGFα protein expression (1.66 ± 0.35 vs. 0.62 ± 0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.0009) and a decrease in angiostatin expression (0.024 ± 0.007 vs. 0.053 ± 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.038) in aortic lysates from α-GAL-Tg/KO compared with that from WT mice. Immunohistochemical staining revealed an adventitial VEGFα signal in α-GAL-Tg/KO mice, whereas no VEGFα signal could be detected in WT mice aortas. No differences in aortic angiostatin expression between α-GAL-Tg/KO- and WT mice could be visualized. The serum levels of VEGFα were significantly upregulated in patients with Fabry's disease compared with that in healthy controls (708.5 ± 426.3 vs. 458.5 ± 181.5 pg/ml, <i>p</i> = 0.048) and positively associated with albuminuria (<i>r</i> = 0.82, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and elevated NTproBNP (<i>r</i> = 0.87, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and hsTNT values (<i>r</i> = 0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.048) in male patients with Fabry's disease. For angiostatin, no significant difference was found between patients with Fabry's disease and healthy controls (747.6 ± 390.3 vs. 858.8 ± 599.3 pg/ml). In conclusion, an overexpression of VEGFα and downregulation of its counter player angiostatin in aortic tissue of α-GAL-Tg/KO mice support the hypothesis of an underlying vasculopathy in Fabry's disease. Elevated VEGFα serum levels were also observed in patients with Fabry's disease and were positively associated with elevated markers of organ manifestation in males. These findings suggest that angiogenetic markers, such as VEGFα, may be potentially useful biomarkers for the detection of endothelial dysfunction in classical Fabry's disease."

    "title": "Experience with cascade screening: A comprehensive family pedigree analysis of two index patients with Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "The wide range of clinical symptoms observed in patients with Fabry disease (FD) often leads to delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Delayed initiation of therapy may result in end-organ damage, such as chronic renal failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and stroke. Although some tools are available to identify undiagnosed patients, new comprehensive screening methods are needed. In this study, the outcomes of the cascade screening applied to three index cases with FD from 2 familes were investigated. In the pedigree analysis, 280 individuals were included; out of them, 131 individuals underwent genetic testing and cascade screening for FD. During the screening program, a total of 45 individuals were diagnosed, with a diagnostic ratio of 1:15. The average age at diagnosis for all individuals was 30.9 ± 17.7 years, and %25 were pediatric cases (mean age 9.5 ± 5.9 years). Thirty affected relatives were diagnosed from the two index cases in Family 1 and 15 individuals were diagnosed from one index case in Family 2. There were 13 consanguineous marriages observed among 2 pedigres, in two both spouses were affected, leading to two homozygous affected daughters in one couple. In regions where there is a high prevalence of consanguineous marriages, implementing the cascade screening approach to identify all individuals at risk can be beneficial for patients with FD, specifically women and children."

    "abstract": "Renal phospholipidosis describes the accumulation of phospholipids in the lysosomes of kidney cells, in particular podocytes. Originally, this was described primarily in the context of the lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease. It is now known that a variety of drugs can lead to the accumulation of lysosomal phospholipids. We present the case of a 69-year-old female patient suffering chronic kidney disease and systemic lupus erythematosus who underwent a kidney biopsy because of a further increase in serum creatinine levels. There was no evidence of lupus nephritis, but electron microscopy showed zebra bodies as a morphological sign of phospholipidosis. This was most likely drug-induced after 25 years of continuous medication with hydroxychloroquine. A renal biopsy 2 years and 6 months earlier, when the renal function of the patient was distinctively better, showed no signs of renal phospholipidosis. Afterward, medication with hydroxychloroquine was discontinued, and renal function parameters remained stable in the 1-year course. This case raises the question of how severely impaired renal function affects the risk of hydroxychloroquine-induced renal phospholipidosis and underlines that hydroxychloroquine should be administered with caution in patients with kidney insufficiency. Moreover, we provide a review of the causes of renal phospholipidosis, which have been described in the literature and give an overview of possible differential diagnoses in cases with histologically proven phospholipidosis in renal biopsies."

Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitors reduce GSL production and have potential to treat multiple GSL storage diseases. AL01211 is a potent, oral GCS inhibitor being developed for the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. AL01211 has minimal central nervous system penetration, allowing for treatment of peripheral organs without risking CNS-associated adverse effects. AL01211 was evaluated in a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study with single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) arms, to determine safety, pharmacokinetics including food effect, and pharmacodynamic effects on associated GSLs. In the SAD arm, AL01211 showed a Tmax of approximately 3.5 hours, mean clearance (CL/F) of 130.1 L/h, and t<sub>1/2</sub> of 39.3 hours. Consuming a high-fat meal prior to dose administration reduced exposures 3.5-5.5-fold, indicating a food effect. In the MAD arm, AL01211 had an approximately 2-fold accumulation, reaching steady-state levels by 10 days. Increasing exposure inversely correlated with a decrease in GSL with plasma glucosylceramide and globotriacylceramide reduction from baseline levels, reaching 78% and 52% by day 14, respectively. AL01211 was generally well-tolerated with no AL01211 associated serious adverse events, thus supporting its further clinical development."

We performed a genetic screening in 300 patients with kidney transplantation, or undiagnosed primary renal disease, in order to identify the primary disease cause and discriminate between overlapping phenotypes. We used a custom-made panel for next-generation sequencing (Agilent technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA), including genes associated with Fabry disease, podocytopaties, complement-mediated nephropathies and Alport syndrome-related diseases. We detected candidate diagnostic variants in genes associated with nephrotic syndrome and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 29 out of 300 patients, solving about 10% of the probands. We also identified the same genetic cause of the disease (<i>PAX2</i>: c.1266dupC) in three family members with different clinical diagnoses. Interestingly we also found one female patient carrying a novel missense variant, c.1259C>A (p.Thr420Lys), in the <i>GLA</i> gene not previously associated with Fabry disease, which is in silico defined as a likely pathogenic and destabilizing, and associated with a mild alteration in GLA enzymatic activity.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GLA gene that encodes α-galactosidase A. Agalsidase beta is a recombinant enzyme replacement therapy authorized in Europe at a standard dose of 1.0 mg/kg intravenously every other week at an initial infusion rate of ≤ 0.25 mg/min until patient tolerance is established, after which the infusion rate may be increased gradually. However, specific practical guidance regarding the progressive reduction in infusion time is lacking. This study investigated a new and specific protocol for reducing agalsidase beta infusion time in which a stable dosage of 15 mg/h is infused for the first four months, and the infusion rate is increased progressively from 15 to 35 mg/h for the subsequent four infusions. The shortest infusion time is reached after six months and maintained thereafter. The incidence of infusion-associated reactions (IARs) and the development of anti-drug antibodies were analyzed, and the disease burden and the clinical evolution of the disease at 12 months were evaluated. Twenty-five of the 31 patients were naïve to enzyme or chaperone treatment at baseline and six patients had been switched from agalsidase alfa. The reduced infusion time protocol was well tolerated. Only one patient exhibited an IAR, with mild symptoms that resolved with low-dose steroids. Six patients globally seroconverted during treatment (4 with a classic phenotype and 2 with late-onset disease). All but three patients were seronegative at month 12. All patients were stable at the study's end (FAbry STabilization indEX value < 20%); reducing infusion time did not negatively impact clinical outcomes in any patient. The perceived medical assessment showed that the quality of life of all patients improved. The study demonstrates that reducing agalsidase beta infusion time is possible and safe from both an immunogenic and clinical point of view. The use of a low infusion rate in the first months when the probability of onset of the development of antibodies is higher contributed to very limited seroconversion to antibody-positive status."

    "abstract": "Defective α-galactosidase A (AGAL/GLA) due to missense or nonsense mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene results in accumulation of the glycosphingolipids globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated derivate globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in cells and body fluids. The aberrant glycosphingolipid metabolism leads to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder, i. e. Fabry disease (FD), characterized by chronic inflammation leading to multiorgan damage. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase-alfa or -beta is one of the main treatment options facilitating cellular Gb3 clearance. Proteome studies have shown changes in complement proteins during ERT. However, the direct activation of the complement system during FD has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate strong activation of the complement system in 17 classical male FD patients with either missense or nonsense mutations before and after ERT as evidenced by high C3a and C5a serum levels. In contrast to the strong reduction of lyso-Gb3 under ERT, C3a and C5a markedly increased in FD patients with nonsense mutations, most of whom developed anti-drug antibodies (ADA), whereas FD patients with missense mutations, which were ADA-negative, showed heterogenous C3a and C5a serum levels under treatment. In addition to the complement activation, we found increased IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-ß1 serum levels in FD patients. This increase was most prominent in patients with missense mutations under ERT, most of whom developed mild nephropathy with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate. Together, our findings demonstrate strong complement activation in FD independent of ERT therapy, especially in males with nonsense mutations and the development of ADAs. In addition, our data suggest kidney cell-associated production of cytokines, which have a strong potential to drive renal damage. Thus, chronic inflammation as a driver of organ damage in FD seems to proceed despite ERT and may prove useful as a target to cope with progressive organ damage."

FD is a rare cause of stroke, and it is still controversial whether in stroke patients FD should be searched from the beginning or at the end of the diagnostic workup (in cryptogenic strokes). Fabry-Stroke Italian Registry is a prospective, multicentric screening involving 33 stroke units. FD was sought by measuring α-galactosidase A activity (males) and by genetic tests (males with reduced enzyme activity and females) in patients aged 18-60 years hospitalized for TIA, ischemic stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage. We diagnosed FD in patients with 1) already known pathogenic GLA variants; 2) novel GLA variants if additional clinical, laboratory, or family-derived criteria were present. Out of 1906 patients, we found a GLA variant in 15 (0.79%; 95%CI 0.44-1.29) with a certain FD diagnosis in 3 (0.16%; 95%CI 0.03-0.46) patients, none of whom had hemorrhage. We identified 1 novel pathogenic GLA variant. Ischemic stroke etiologies in carriers of GLA variants were: cardioaortic embolism (33%), small artery occlusion (27%), other causes (20%), and undetermined (20%). Mild severity, recurrence, previous TIA, acroparesthesias, hearing loss, and small artery occlusion were predictors of GLA variant. In this large multicenter cohort the frequency of FD and GLA variants was consistent with previous reports. Limiting the screening for GLA variants to patients with cryptogenic stroke may miss up to 80% of diagnoses. Some easily recognizable clinical features could help select patients for FD screening."

We aim to discuss the biochemical processes that operate in parallel to sphingolipid accumulation and contribute to disease pathogenesis, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of these processes. Beyond sphingolipid accumulation, emerging studies have revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation could be significant contributors to Fabry disease and cardiac involvement. These factors promote cardiac remodeling and fibrosis and may predispose Fabry patients to conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias, and heart failure. While current treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy and pharmacological chaperones, address disease progression and symptoms, their effectiveness is limited. Our review uncovers the potential relationships among metabolic disturbances, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in Fabry disease-related cardiac complications. Current findings suggest that beyond sphingolipid accumulation, other mechanisms may significantly contribute to disease pathogenesis. This prompts the exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies and underscores the importance of a holistic approach to understanding and managing Fabry disease."

The selective and accurate detection of biochemicals is an essential part of biosensing devices, which is to be done through effective functionalization of highly specific recognition agents, such as enzymes, DNA, receptors, etc., over the transducing surface. Among many optical fiber-based sensing technologies, optical fiber interferometry-based biosensors are one of the broadly used methods with the advantages of biocompatibility, compact size, high sensitivity, high-resolution sensing, lower detection limits, operating wavelength tunability, etc. This Review provides a comprehensive review of the fundamentals as well as the current advances in developing optical fiber interferometry-based biochemical sensors. In the beginning, a generic biosensor and its several components are introduced, followed by the fundamentals and state-of-art technology behind developing a variety of interferometry-based fiber optic sensors. These include the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the Michelson interferometer, the Fabry-Perot interferometer, the Sagnac interferometer, and biolayer interferometry (BLI). Further, several technical reports are comprehensively reviewed and compared in a tabulated form for better comparison along with their advantages and disadvantages. Further, the limitations and possible solutions for these sensors are discussed to transform these in-lab devices into commercial industry applications. At the end, in conclusion, comments on the prospects of field development toward the commercialization of sensor technology are also provided. The Review targets a broad range of audiences including beginners and also motivates the experts helping to solve the real issues for developing an industry-oriented sensing device."

This nationwide observational study was conducted using the National Health Claims database of the Korean population with FD. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). MACE risk factors in FD were evaluated using time-dependent Cox regression. Between January 2007 and April 2022, 188 patients with FD were analyzed. Among them, 22 (11.7%) experienced MACE (males: 14/95 [14.7%]; females: 8/93 [8.6%]). The mean age at MACE diagnosis was 53.5 ± 11.0 years in all patients with FD, which was lower in males compared with in females (49.7 ± 9.6 vs. 60.0 ± 10.7 years, <i>p</i> = 0.030). Multivariate analysis (HR, 95% CI) revealed that age (1.042; 1.004-1.082) and duration of FD nontreatment (1.040; 1.003-1.078) were significant MACE risk factors in all patients. In males, age (1.080; 1.032-1.131), FD nontreatment duration (1.099; 1.048-1.152), and keratopathy (18.920; 4.174-85.749) were significant MACE risk factors in multivariate analysis. In females, the only significant MACE risk factor was a high Charlson comorbidity index score (1.795; 1.229-2.622). In conclusion, duration of FD nontreatment and keratopathy are significant MACE risk factors in males with FD. These findings suggest the importance of early initiation of FD-specific treatment and careful evaluation of keratopathy in males with FD."

This leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, and nervous system. While FD was initially considered predominantly affecting males, recent studies have uncovered that heterozygous Fabry women, carrying a single mutated <i>GLA</i> gene, can manifest a wide array of clinical symptoms, challenging the notion of asymptomatic carriers. The mechanisms underlying the diverse clinical manifestations in females remain not fully understood due to X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). XCI also known as \"lyonization\", involves the random inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes. This process is considered a potential factor influencing phenotypic variation. This review delves into the complex landscape of FD in women, discussing its genetic basis, the available biomarkers, clinical manifestations, and the potential impact of XCI on disease severity. Additionally, it highlights the challenges faced by heterozygous Fabry women, both in terms of their disease burden and interactions with healthcare professionals. Current treatment options, including enzyme replacement therapy, are discussed, along with the need for healthcare providers to be well-informed about FD in women, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), which are characterized by genetic and metabolic lysosomal dysfunctions, constitute over 60 degenerative diseases with considerable health and economic burdens. However, the mechanisms driving the progressive death of functional cells due to lysosomal defects remain incompletely understood, and broad-spectrum therapeutics against LSDs are lacking. Here, we found that various gene abnormalities that cause LSDs, including Hexb, Gla, Npc1, Ctsd and Gba, all shared mutual properties to robustly autoactivate neuron-intrinsic cGAS-STING signalling, driving neuronal death and disease progression. This signalling was triggered by excessive cytoplasmic congregation of the dsDNA and DNA sensor cGAS in neurons. Genetic ablation of cGAS or STING, digestion of neuronal cytosolic dsDNA by DNase, and repair of neuronal lysosomal dysfunction alleviated symptoms of Sandhoff disease, Fabry disease and Niemann-Pick disease, with substantially reduced neuronal loss. We therefore identify a ubiquitous mechanism mediating the pathogenesis of a variety of LSDs, unveil an inherent connection between lysosomal defects and innate immunity, and suggest a uniform strategy for curing LSDs."

Among the 126 positive newborns (0.051%), 51 infants were confirmed as affected (positive predictive value 40%), with an overall incidence of 1:4874. Of these, three patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease, two with neonatal-onset Gaucher disease and four with mucopolysaccharidosis type I were immediately treated. Furthermore, another four Gaucher disease patients needed treatment in the first years of life. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment allow the achievement of better patient outcomes. Challenges such as false-positive rates, the diagnosis of variants of uncertain significance or late-onset forms and the lack of treatment for neuronopathic forms, should be addressed."

    "title": "Anderson-Fabry Disease: Red Flags for Early Diagnosis of Cardiac Involvement.",
    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a lysosome storage disorder resulting from an X-linked inheritance of a mutation in the galactosidase A (GLA) gene encoding for the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-GAL A). This mutation results in a deficiency or absence of α-GAL A activity, with a progressive intracellular deposition of glycosphingolipids leading to organ dysfunction and failure. Cardiac damage starts early in life, often occurring sub-clinically before overt cardiac symptoms. Left ventricular hypertrophy represents a common cardiac manifestation, albeit conduction system impairment, arrhythmias, and valvular abnormalities may also characterize AFD. Even in consideration of pleiotropic manifestation, diagnosis is often challenging. Thus, knowledge of cardiac and extracardiac diagnostic \"red flags\" is needed to guide a timely diagnosis. Indeed, considering its systemic involvement, a multidisciplinary approach may be helpful in discerning AFD-related cardiac disease. Beyond clinical pearls, a practical approach to assist clinicians in diagnosing AFD includes optimal management of biochemical tests, genetic tests, and cardiac biopsy. We extensively reviewed the current literature on AFD cardiomyopathy, focusing on cardiac \"red flags\" that may represent key diagnostic tools to establish a timely diagnosis. Furthermore, clinical findings to identify patients at higher risk of sudden death are also highlighted."

Substrate accumulation in lysosomes is thought to trigger an inflammatory response and is responsible for progressive organ damage through the induction of autoimmunity. The levels of pteridine and kynurenine pathway metabolites increase when immune activation is observed and are employed to monitor several diseases and determine prognosis. To elucidate the effects of immune activation on the pathophysiology of Fabry disease and to investigate the potential utility of pteridine and kynurenine metabolites. A prospective case-control study. In this study, 33 patients with Fabry disease and 33 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Blood pteridine and kynurenine metabolites were studied in both groups. Organ involvement in Fabry disease and its correlation with the pteridine and kynurenine pathways were also investigated. The patients’ neopterin and biopterin levels and the tryptophan/kynurenine ratio were statistically higher than those of the healthy control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A statistically significant association was found between neopterin levels and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, and GFR values (<i>p</i> = 0.044, <i>p</i> = 0.021, and <i>p</i> = 0.030, respectively), tryptophan and corneal verticillate, hearing loss and tinnitus (<i>p</i> = 0.010, <i>p</i> = 0.009 and <i>p</i> = 0.046, respectively), and kynurenine levels and valvular heart disease (<i>p</i> = 0.020). From the onset of the disease, patients with Fabry disease exhibited elevated levels of inflammation and immune activation. Furthermore, inflammation and immune activation markers can be used as early disease biomarkers."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting both males and females caused by genetic abnormalities in the gene encoding the enzyme α-galactosidase A. FD-affected patients represent a highly variable clinical course with first symptoms already appearing in young age. The disease causes a progressive multiple organ dysfunction affecting mostly the heart, kidneys and nervous system, eventually leading to premature death. Disease-specific management of FD includes enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase α and β or pharmacological oral chaperone migalastat. Migalastat is a low-molecular-mass iminosugar, that reversibly binds to active site of amenable enzyme variants, stabilizing their molecular structure and improving trafficking to the lysosome. Migalastat was approved in the EU in 2016 and is an effective therapy in the estimated 35-50% of all patients with FD with amenable GLA gene variants. This position statement is the first comprehensive review in Central and Eastern Europe of the current role of migalastat in the treatment of FD. The statement provides an overview of the pharmacology of migalastat and summarizes the current evidence from the clinical trial program regarding the safety and efficacy of the drug and its effects on organs typically involved in FD. The position paper also includes a practical guide for clinicians on the optimal selection of patients with FD who will benefit from migalastat treatment, recommendations on the optimal selection of diagnostic tests and the use of tools to identify patients with amenable GLA mutations. Areas for future migalastat clinical research have also been identified."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the alpha-galactosidase-A gene (<i>GLA</i>). Life threatening complications in adulthood include chronic kidney failure, strokes and the cardiac involvement which is the leading cause of mortality. Usually, it presents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, together with arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. An early indicator is decreased T1 value on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is effective on some extra-cardiac symptoms but its effect on cardiac lesions depends on the level of initial myocardial lesions. CMR is routinely used to monitor cardiac involvement in FD due to its capacity for tissular characterization. However, there is a lack of data on the pediatric population to understand how to integrate CMR into early therapeutic decisions. Monocentric longitudinal study carried out at Montpellier University Hospital from 2016 to 2022. All pediatric patients with FD were evaluated over time with clinical, biological, and cardiac imaging (CMR, echocardiography). Out of the six patients included, (3 males), five were treated with ERT during the study. Low T1 values were observed in 4 patients. The normalization of T1 values was observed after 4 years of ERT in 3 patients. Due to the lack of strong clinical and biological markers of FD in pediatric patients, initiation and follow-up of ERT efficacy remain challenging. CMR with T1-mapping, a noninvasive method, could play a role in the evaluation of early cardiac impairment in young patients at diagnosis and during follow-up with or without ERT."

This is a national, multicenter, observational study performed between August 24, 2017 and February 28, 2020. Patients with the presence of proteinuria or treated on dialysis were screened by measuring the α-Gal A enzyme activity using either dried blood spot or whole blood, and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL3) concentration. A GLA gene analysis was performed in patients with low α-Gal A enzyme activity or increased plasma lyso-GL3 concentration. Of 897 screened patients, 405 (45.2%) were male and 279 (31.1%) were on dialysis. The α-Gal A enzyme activity was measured in 891 patients (99.3%), and plasma lyso-GL3 concentration was measured in all patients. Ten patients were eligible for a GLA gene analysis: eight with low α-Gal A enzyme activity and two with increased plasma lyso-GL3 concentration. The GLA mutations were analyzed in nine patients and one patient was found with a pathogenic mutation. Therefore, one patient was identified with FD, giving a prevalence of 0.1% (1 of 897) in this CKD population. Although the prevalence of FD in the CKD population was low (0.1%), screening tests are crucial to detect potential diseases in patients with relatives who can benefit from early treatment."

In Australia, treatment access is subject to eligibility criteria initially established in 2004. Patients and their clinicians question why these criteria have remained unchanged despite significant progress in disease understanding. Appraise the clinical quality of the Australian treatment access criteria. The Fabry Australia Medical Advisory Committee (N = 6) used the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation Global Rating Scale (AGREE II GRS) to assess the clinical quality of the current treatment eligibility criteria. They reviewed the literature, developed 17 clinical statements to help guide reforms of the eligibility criteria and achieved consensus (achievement of ≥75% agreement in the range 5-7 on a 7-point Likert scale) through anonymous voting. The findings were applied to develop proposals for revised classification and treatment initiation criteria. The current treatment eligibility criteria underperformed on the AGREE II GRS. They are pragmatic but out-of-step with contemporary data. Consensus was achieved on all 17 proposed clinical statements. There was strong agreement to differentiate classical male Fabry patients to facilitate timelier access to Fabry-specific treatment. There was also agreement on the value of adopting relevant organ involvement criteria in classical female patients and patients with non-classical disease. Australian access criteria are misaligned with current clinical evidence. The clinical statements and proposed classification and initiation criteria should prompt discussions to support more equitable access to treatment and better align Australian practice with contemporary evidence and international guidelines."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare inherited disorder resulting from deficient α-galactosidase A enzyme activity. Common disease manifestations are sweating abnormalities, neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue. Challenges are faced by health care professionals in evaluating symptom burden in the current clinical setting, and the demand for alternative methods for monitoring disease-specific symptoms has seen an acceleration in recent years. Smartphone technologies offer the potential for continuity of care and surveillance. As a part of a quality improvement project, a disease specific app was developed in collaboration with a software company (Health Touch Ltd) and made available for patient use in May 2018. The Fabry mobile app records five categories: pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, sweating, activity levels, medications. Fabry disease patients with gastrointestinal and pain symptoms attending the Lysosomal Storage Disorders Unit of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust were reviewed to assess eligibility and invited to download the app for recording their symptoms (activity, sweating, pain and gastrointestinal) and medications. Patient-generated data were transmitted to a secure website for clinicians to review. One-hundred and thirty-nine symptomatic Fabry disease patients who had a smartphone (iPhone or android) were invited to download the app. Sixty-seven patients (26 males and 41 females; median age, 49 years [range, 20-81]) downloaded and tracked the Fabry App at least once. The median frequency of use per patient was 6 (range, 1-629). Pain in the hands and abdominal pain were significantly higher (p = 0.009 and p = 0.007, respectively) in patients with classic phenotype compared with patients with non-classic phenotypes. We demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone app to facilitate the remote assessment and monitoring of Fabry disease symptom burden on a daily/weekly basis, as an alternative to the current standard of care that requires patients to recall their symptoms during 6 to 12 monthly annual clinic visits. Patients who were more likely to use the app had greater disease burden. This innovation has the potential to assess disease progression, early therapeutic intervention, thereby decreasing the burden of morbidity and mortality among Fabry patients, and to record long-term effects of Fabry-specific therapies."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a recessive monogenic disease linked to chromosome X due to more than two hundred mutations in the alfa-galactosidase A (GLA) gene. Modifications of the GLA gene may cause the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form, globotriasylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), in lysosomes of several types of cells of the heart, kidneys, skin, eyes, peripheral and central nervous system (not clearly and fully demonstrated), and gut with different and pleiotropic clinical symptoms. Among the main symptoms are acroparesthesias and pain crisis (involving the peripheral nervous system), hypohidrosis, abdominal pain, gut motility abnormalities (involving the autonomic system), and finally, cerebrovascular ischemic events due to macrovascular involvement (TIA and stroke) and lacunar strokes and white matter abnormalities due to a small vessel disease (SVS). Gb3 lysosomal accumulation causes cytoplasmatic disruption and subsequent cell death. Additional consequences of Gb3 deposits are inflammatory processes, abnormalities of leukocyte function, and impaired trafficking of some types of immune cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes, CD8+ cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. The involvement of inflammation in AFD pathogenesis conflicts with the reported poor correlation between CRP levels as an inflammation marker and clinical scores such as the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI). Also, some authors have suggested an autoimmune reaction is involved in the disease's pathogenetic mechanism after the α-galactosidase A deficiency. Some studies have reported a high degree of neuronal apoptosis inhibiting protein as a critical anti-apoptotic mediator in children with Fabry disease compared to healthy controls. Notably, this apoptotic upregulation did not change after treatment with enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT), with a further upregulation of the apoptosis-inducing factor after ERT started. Gb3-accumulation has been reported to increase the degree of oxidative stress indexes and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lipids and proteins have been reported as oxidized and not functioning. Thus, neurological complications are linked to different pathogenetic molecular mechanisms. Progressive accumulation of Gb3 represents a possible pathogenetic event of peripheral nerve involvement. In contrast, central nervous system participation in the clinical setting of cerebrovascular ischemic events seems to be due to the epitheliopathy of Anderson-Fabry disease with lacunar lesions and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). In this review manuscript, we revised molecular mechanisms of peripheral and central neurological complications of Anderson-Fabry Disease. The management of Fabry disease may be improved by the identification of biomarkers that reflect the clinical course, severity, and progression of the disease. Intensive research on biomarkers has been conducted over the years to detect novel markers that may potentially be used in clinical practice as a screening tool, in the context of the diagnostic process and as an indicator of response to treatment. Recent proteomic or metabolomic studies are in progress, investigating plasma proteome profiles in Fabry patients: these assessments may be useful to characterize the molecular pathology of the disease, improve the diagnostic process, and monitor the response to treatment."

A monochrome image sensor with a resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels was used, and two multispectral filter arrays were developed and mounted on the sensors. The filter pitch was 4.5 μm, and each multispectral filter array consisted of eight bands. Band selection was performed using a genetic algorithm. For VIS and NIR filters, maximum RMS values of 0.0740 and 0.0986 were obtained, respectively. The spectral response of the filters in VIS was significant; however, in NIR, the spectral response of the filters after 830 nm decreased by half.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosome storage disease that results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) throughout the body leading to irreversible target organ damage. As the role of secondary mediators (inflammatory molecules) and their mechanisms has not been fully elucidated, we focused on the interleukin (IL)-6 system in adult FD patients and in matched healthy subjects. To obtain insights into the complex regulation of IL-6 actions, we used a novel approach that integrates information from plasma and exosomes of FD patients (n = 20) and of healthy controls (n = 15). Soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) levels were measured in plasma with the ELISA method, and membrane-bound IL-6R was quantified in plasma and urinary exosomes using flow cytometry. In FD patients, the levels of soluble IL-6R in plasma were higher than in control subjects (28.0 ± 5.4 ng/mL vs. 18.9 ± 5.4 ng/mL, <i>p</i> < 0.0001); they were also higher in FD subjects with the classical form as compared to those with the late-onset form of the disease (36.0 ± 11.4 ng/mL vs. 26.1 ± 4.5 ng/mL, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The percentage of urinary exosomes positive for IL-6R was slightly lower in FD (97 ± 1 vs. 100 ± 0% of events positive for IL-6R, <i>p</i> < 0.05); plasma IL-6 levels were not increased. These results suggest a potential role of IL-6 in triggering the inflammatory response in FD. As in FD patients only the levels of sIL-6Rs are consistently higher than in healthy controls, the IL-6 pathogenic signal seems to prevail over the homeostatic one, suggesting a potential mechanism causing multi-systemic damage in FD."

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are known to reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) by dilating the glomerular export arteries and reducing intraglomerular pressure. This improvement in intraglomerular pressure, although lowering the glomerular filtration rate, is thought to prevent renal damage and be renoprotective in the long term. RAS inhibitors may be effective in FD patients with proteinuria to prevent the progression of kidney disease, however, the degree to which they are used in clinical practice is unknown. The J-CKD-DB-Ex is a comprehensive multicenter database that automatically extracts medical data on CKD patients. J-CKD-DB-Ex contains data on 187,398 patients in five medical centers. FD patients were identified by ICD-10. Clinical data and prescriptions of FD patients between January 1 of 2014, and December 31 of 2020 were used for the analysis. We identified 39 patients with FD from the J-CKD-DB-Ex including those with suspected FD. We confirmed 22 patients as FD. Half of the patients received RAS inhibitors. RAS inhibitors tended to be used in CKD patients with more severe renal impairment. This case series revealed the actual clinical practice of FD patients with CKD. In particular, we found cases in which patients had proteinuria, but were not treated with RAS inhibitors. The database was shown to be useful in assessing the clinical patterns of patients with rare diseases."

Lack of awareness of FD and frequent misdiagnoses cause long diagnostic delays. To address the urgent need for earlier diagnosis, we created an online, risk-assessment scoring tool, the FDrisk, for predicting an individual's risk for FD and prompting diagnostic testing and clinical evaluation. Utilizing electronic health records, data were collected retrospectively from randomly selected, deidentified patients with FD treated at the Emory Lysosomal Storage Disease Center. Deidentified, negative controls were randomly selected from the Fabry Disease Diagnostic Testing and Education project database, a program within the American Association of Kidney Patients Center for Patient Education and Research. Diagnosis of FD was documented by evidence of a pathogenic variant in <i>GLA</i> and/or an abnormal level of leukocyte α-Gal A. Thirty characteristic clinical features of FD were initially identified and subsequently curated into 16 clinical covariates used as predictors for the risk of FD. An overall prediction model and two sex-specific prediction models were built. Two-hundred and sixty samples (130 cases, 130 controls) were used to train the risk prediction models. One-hundred and ninety-seven independent samples (30 cases, 167 controls) were used for testing model performance. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using a threshold of 0.5 to determine a predicted case vs. control. The overall risk prediction model demonstrated 80% sensitivity, 83.8% specificity, and positive predictive value of 47.1%. The male model demonstrated 75% sensitivity, 95.8% specificity, and positive predictive value of 75%. The female model demonstrated 83.3% sensitivity, 81.3% specificity, and positive predictive value of 45.5%. Patients with risk scores at or above 50% are categorized as \"at risk\" for FD and should be sent for diagnostic testing. We have developed a statistical risk prediction model, the FDrisk, a validated, clinician-friendly, online, risk-assessment scoring tool for predicting an individual's risk for FD and prompting diagnostic testing and clinical evaluation. As an easily accessible, user-friendly scoring tool, we believe implementing the FDrisk will significantly decrease the time to diagnosis and allow earlier initiation of FD-specific therapy."

Five patients had proteinuria, including one with chronic kidney disease stage 3 and one with chronic kidney disease stage 5. Cardiac involvement occurred in three patients, two had myocardial hypertrophy and one had valvular insufficiency. The activity of galactosidase decreased in seven patients (2.80-1.55 μmol·L<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>). Plasma deacetyl-GL-3 was elevated in all 10 patients(3.12-120.00 ng/ml). Three patients underwent renal biopsy, wherein two cases of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and one of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was found. A large number of myeloid and zebra bodies were found in the podocytes in three patients, including a small number of myeloid and zebra bodies in the renal tubular epithelial cells in one patient with occasional zebra bodies in the renal interstitium. Nine patients had GLA gene mutations. One patient was c.102T>A, a de novo mutation. Four patients were treated with agalsidase α injection (0.2 mg/kg, intravenous infusion every 2 weeks), and their prognosis was good. FD has various clinical manifestations and multi-system involvement, which requires multidisciplinary cooperation.

We developed unbiased stereology protocols to quantify the ultrastrcture of Fabry cardiomyopathy. Endomyocardial biopsies from 10 adult male enzyme replacement therapy naïve Fabry patients with IVS4 + 919G>A GLA mutation were studied. The findings were correlated with cardiac MRI and clinical data. Ultrastructural parameters showed significant relationships with key imaging and clinical and functional variables. Average cardiomyocyte volume and GL-3 volume per cardiomyocyte were progressively increased with age. Eighty-four percent of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) variability was explained by cardiomyocyte nuclear volume, age and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine with cardiomyocyte nuclear volume being the only independent predictor of LVMI. Septal thickness was directly and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was inversely correlated with cardiomyocyte GL-3 accumulation. Sixty-five percent of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) variability was explained by cardiomyocyte GL3 volume, serum α-galactosidase-A activity and age with cardiomyocyte GL3 volume being the only independent predictor of LVEF. Residual α-galactosidase-A activity was directly correlated with myocardial microvasculature density. The unbiased stereological methods introduced in this study unraveled novel relationships between cardiomyocyte structure and important imaging and clinical parameters.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic condition caused by mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene, located on the X chromosome in the <i>RPL36-HNRNPH2</i> readthrough genomic region. This gene produces an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). When the enzyme does not function properly due to the mutations, it causes harmful substances called globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) to build up in the body's lysosomes. This accumulation can damage the kidneys, heart, eyes, and nervous system. Recent studies have shown that the <i>RPL36A-HNRNPH2</i> readthrough loci, which include <i>RPL36A</i> and <i>HNRNPH2</i> genes, as well as the regulatory sequence known as the <i>GLA-HNRNPH2</i> bidirectional promoter, may also play a role in FD. However, the involvement of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in FD is still poorly understood despite their known role in various diseases. To investigate this further, we studied an <i>RPL36A</i> enhancer called GH0XJ101390 and showed its genomic setting in the <i>RPL36-HNRNPH2</i> readthrough region; the eRNA is rich in Homotypic Clusters of TFBSs (HCTs) type and hosts a CpG Island (CGI). To test the functional correlation further with <i>GLA</i>, <i>RPL36A</i>, and <i>HNRNPH2</i>, we used siRNAs to knock down GH0XJ101390 in human kidney embryonic cells 293T. The results showed a significant decrease in <i>RPL36A</i> and <i>GLA</i> expression and a non-significant decrease in <i>HNRNPH2</i> expression. These findings could have important implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of GH0XJ101390 and its potential role in FD. A better understanding of these mechanisms may improve diagnostic and therapeutic methods for FD, which could ultimately benefit patients with this rare condition."

    "title": "Clinical utilisation of implantable loop recorders in adults with Fabry disease-a multi-centre snapshot study.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked deficiency of alpha-galactosidase-A, leading to lysosomal storage of sphingolipids in multiple organs. Myocardial accumulation contributes to arrhythmia and sudden death, the most common cause of FD mortality. Therefore, there is a need for risk stratification and prediction to target device therapy. Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) allow for continual rhythm monitoring for up to 3 years. Here, we performed a retrospective study to evaluate current ILR utilisation in FD and quantify the burden of arrhythmia that was detected, which resulted in a modification of therapy. This was a snapshot assessment of 915 patients with FD across three specialist centres in England during the period between 1 January 2000 and 1 September 2022. In total, 22 (2.4%) patients underwent clinically indicated ILR implantation. The mean implantation age was 50 years and 13 (59%) patients were female. Following implantation, nine (41%) patients underwent arrhythmia detection, requiring intervention (six on ILR and three post-ILR battery depletion). Three patients experienced sustained atrial high-rate episodes and were started on anticoagulation. Three had non-sustained tachyarrhythmia and were started on beta blockers. Post-ILR battery depletion, one suffered complete heart block and two had sustained ventricular tachycardia, all requiring device therapy. Those with arrhythmia had a shorter PR interval on electrocardiography. This study demonstrates that ILR implantation in FD uncovers a high burden of arrhythmia. ILRs are likely to be underutilised in this pro-arrhythmic cohort, perhaps restricted to those with advanced FD cardiomyopathy. Following battery depletion in three patients as mentioned above, greater vigilance and arrhythmia surveillance are advised for those experiencing major arrhythmic events post-ILR monitoring. Further work is required to establish who would benefit most from implantation."

    "title": "Exosomal miRNAs as Biomarkers of Ischemic Stroke.",
    "abstract": "Exosomes are small lipid bilayer membrane particles released from all living cells into the extracellular environment. They carry several molecules and have a critical role in cell-cell communication under physiological and pathological conditions. In recent decades, exosomes, and especially their cargo, have emerged as a promising tool for several clinical conditions. However, the literature has become increasingly unambiguous in defining the role of exosomes in chronic cerebrovascular diseases. Because they can pass through the blood-brain barrier, they have great potential to reflect intracerebral changes. They can, thus, provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of central nervous system diseases. The purpose of this review is to describe the literature on the role of exosomal miRNA, which represents the most widely investigated exosomal biomarker, in strokes. First, we provide an overview of exosomes, from biology to isolation and characterization. Then, we describe the relationship between exosomes and stroke pathogenesis. Finally, we summarize the human studies evaluating exosomal miRNA biomarkers of stroke. Although the collective literature supports the potential use of exosomal miRNA as biomarkers of ischemic stroke, there are still several limitations hampering their introduction into clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked hereditary disorder caused by deficient α-galactosidase A (GLA) activity. Patients with Fabry disease are often treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). However, ERT often induces the formation of neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs), which may impair the therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old man with Fabry disease and resultant neutralizing ADAs who was treated by switching from agalsidase-α to agalsidase-β. We monitored biomarkers, such as plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), urinary globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), urinary mulberry bodies, renal and cardiac parameters, and disease severity during the treatment period. Although plasma lyso-Gb3 and urinary Gb3 levels quickly decreased within two months after the initiation of ERT with agalsidase-α, they gradually increased thereafter. The urinary mulberry bodies continued to appear. Both the ADA titer and serum mediated GLA inhibition rates started to increase after two months. Moreover, 3.5 years after ERT, the vacuolated podocyte area in the renal biopsy decreased slightly from 23.1 to 18.9%. However, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels increased, and urinary Gb3, mulberry body levels, and ADA titers remained high. Therefore, we switched to agalsidase-β which reduced, but did not normalize, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and stabilized renal and cardiac parameters. Disease severity was attenuated. However, urinary Gb3 and mulberry body levels did not decrease noticeably in the presence of high ADA titers. The kidneys take up a small amount of the administered recombinant enzyme, and the clearance of Gb3 that has accumulated in the kidney may be limited despite the switching from agalsidase-α to agalsidase-β."

    "abstract": "Podocyte dysfunction plays a crucial role in renal injury and is identified as a key contributor to proteinuria in Fabry disease (FD), primarily impacting glomerular filtration function (GFF). The α3β1 integrins are important for podocyte adhesion to the glomerular basement membrane, and disturbances in these integrins can lead to podocyte injury. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of chloroquine (CQ) on podocytes, as this drug can be used to obtain an in vitro condition analogous to the FD. Murine podocytes were employed in our experiments. The results revealed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability. CQ at a sub-lethal concentration (1.0 µg/mL) induced lysosomal accumulation significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Morphological changes were evident through scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, highlighting alterations in F-actin and nucleus morphology. No significant changes were observed in the gene expression of α3β1 integrins via RT-qPCR. Protein expression of α3 integrin was evaluated with Western Blotting and immunofluorescence, demonstrating its lower detection in podocytes exposed to CQ. Our findings propose a novel in vitro model for exploring secondary Fabry nephropathy, indicating a modulation of α3β1 integrin and morphological alterations in podocytes under the influence of CQ."

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). People with infantile-onset disease have either a complete or a near-complete enzyme deficiency; people with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) retain some residual enzyme activity. GAA deficiency is treated with an intravenous infusion of recombinant human acid alglucosidase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa are approved treatments, but cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat is not yet approved. To assess the effects of enzyme replacement therapies in people with late-onset Pompe disease. We searched the Cochrane Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched MEDLINE OvidSP, clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 21 April 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ERT in people with LOPD of any age. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence (using GRADE). We resolved disagreements through discussion and by consulting a third author. We included six trials (358 randomised participants) lasting from 12 to 78 weeks. A single trial reported on each comparison listed below. None of the included trials assessed two of our secondary outcomes: need for respiratory support and use of a walking aid or wheelchair. Certainty of evidence was most commonly downgraded for selective reporting bias. Alglucosidase alfa versus placebo (90 participants) After 78 weeks, alglucosidase alfa probably improves the six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 30.95 metres, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.98 to 53.92; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably improves respiratory function, measured as the change in per cent (%) predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 3.55, 95% CI 1.46 to 5.64; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the groups in occurrence of infusion reactions (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.61; low-certainty evidence), quality of life physical component score (MD -1.36 points, 95% CI -5.59 to 2.87; low-certainty evidence), or adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39; low-certainty evidence). Alglucosidase alfa plus clenbuterol versus alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (13 participants) The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alglucosidase alfa plus clenbuterol compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo on: change in 6MWT distance after 52 weeks (MD 34.55 metres, 95% CI-10.11 to 79.21; very low-certainty evidence) and change in % predicted FVC (MD -13.51%, 95% CI -32.44 to 5.41; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure infusion reactions, quality of life, and adverse events. Alglucosidase alfa plus albuterol versus alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (13 participants) The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alglucosidase alfa plus albuterol compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo on: change in 6MWT distance after 52 weeks (MD 30.00 metres, 95% CI 0.55 to 59.45; very low-certainty evidence), change in % predicted FVC (MD -4.30%, 95% CI -14.87 to 6.27; very low-certainty evidence), and risk of adverse events (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.18; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure infusion reactions and quality of life. VAL-1221 versus alglucosidase alfa (12 participants) Insufficient information was available about this trial to generate effect estimates measured at one year or later. Compared to alglucosidase alfa, VAL-1221 may increase or reduce infusion-associated reactions at three months, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.80, 95% CI 0.18 to 42.80). This study did not measure quality of life and adverse events. Cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat versus alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (125 participants) Compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo, cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat may make little or no difference to: 6MWT distance at 52 weeks (MD 13.60 metres, 95% CI -2.26 to 29.46); infusion reactions (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.80); quality of life scores for physical function (MD 1.70, 95% CI -2.13 to 5.53) and fatigue (MD -0.30, 95% CI -2.76 to 2.16); and adverse effects potentially related to treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.40) (all low-certainty evidence). Cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat probably improves % predicted FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (MD 3.10%, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.16; moderate-certainty evidence); however, it may make little or no change in % predicted sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (MD -0.06%, 95% CI -8.91 to 7.71; low-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa (100 participants) After 49 weeks, avalglucosidase alfa probably improves 6MWT compared to alglucosidase alfa (MD 30.02 metres, 95% CI 1.84 to 58.20; moderate-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa probably makes little or no difference to % predicted FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa (MD 2.43%, 95% CI -0.08 to 4.94; moderate-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa may make little or no difference to infusion reactions (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.45), quality of life (MD 0.77, 95% CI -2.09 to 3.63), or treatment-related adverse events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.40), all low-certainty evidence. One trial compared the effect of ERT to placebo in LOPD, showing that alglucosidase alfa probably improves 6MWT and respiratory function (both moderate-certainty evidence). Avalglucosidase alfa probably improves 6MWT compared with alglucosidase alfa (moderate-certainty evidence). Cipaglucosidase plus miglustat probably improves FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). Other trials studied the adjunct effect of clenbuterol and albuterol along with alglucosidase alfa, with little to no evidence of benefit. No significant rise in adverse events was noted with all ERTs. The impact of ERT on some outcomes remains unclear, and longer RCTs are needed to generate relevant information due to the progressive nature of LOPD. Alternative resources, such as post-marketing registries, could capture some of this information."

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of new echocardiographic indices including mitral valve thickness and papillary muscle (PM) hypertrophy to differentiate CA and FD. In patients with confirmed CA and FD, a detailed assessment of valvular function, mitral valve leaflet thickness and PM area as well as PM left ventricular area ratio (PM/LV-ratio) was performed in offline analyses. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of mitral valve thickness, PM hypertrophy, and PM/LV-ratio to distinguish CA from FD. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 129 patients (FD n = 49, CA n = 80). CA patients showed significantly more thickened mitral valve leaflets (4.1 ± 1.3 mm vs. 2.9 ± 1.1 mm, p < 0.001) and a higher PM area [4.0 (3.1-4.6) mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 2.8 (2.1-4.6) mm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.009] with a comparable PM/LV-ratio in both groups. Mitral valve thickness showed the highest diagnostic accuracy to discriminate CA [AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.87)]. The prevalence of aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonary valve regurgitation was significantly higher in CA (aortic regurgitation ≥ II° 13% vs. 4%, tricuspid regurgitation≥ II° 19% vs. 8%, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that the assessment of mitral valve thickness may be a new useful echocardiographic parameter to differentiate CA and FD, whereas papillary muscle hypertrophy and PM/LV-ratio showed a limited diagnostic performance to discriminate CA.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the prevalence of FD in high-risk populations and newborns and evaluate the impact of different <i>GLA</i> variant classifications on the estimated prevalence of FD. We searched the EMBASE and PubMed databases on February 21, 2023. Observational studies evaluating the prevalence of FD and reporting the identified <i>GLA</i> variants were included. <i>GLA</i> variants were re-evaluated for their pathogenicity significance using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria and the ClinVar database. The pooled prevalence of FD among different settings was calculated. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023401663) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Of the 3941 studies identified, 110 met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of FD was significantly different according to the clinical setting and criteria used for the pathogenicity assessment. Using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria, the pooled prevalence was 1.2% in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (26 studies; 10 080 patients screened), 0.3% in end-stage renal disease/chronic kidney disease (38 studies; 62 050 patients screened), 0.7% in stroke (25 studies; 15 295 patients screened), 0.7% in cardiac conduction disturbance requiring pacemaker (3 studies; 1033 patients screened), 1.0% in small-fiber neuropathy (3 studies; 904 patients screened), and 0.01% in newborns (15 studies; 11 108 793 newborns screened). The pooled prevalence was different if the <i>GLA</i> variants were assessed using the ClinVar database, and most patients with a discrepancy in the pathogenicity assignment carried 1 of the following variants: p.A143T, p.D313Y, and p.E66Q. This systematic review and meta-analysis describe the prevalence of FD among newborns and high-risk populations, highlighting the need for a periodic reassessment of the <i>GLA</i> variants in the context of recent clinical, biochemical, and histological data.

Therefore, we here propose a practical staging of FD cardiomyopathy, in hopes it may represent the standard for cardiac evaluation and facilitate communication between specialized FD centres and primary care physicians. We identified 4 main stages of FD cardiomyopathy of increasing severity, based on available evidence from clinical and imaging studies: non-hypertrophic, hypertrophic - pre-fibrotic, hypertrophic - fibrotic, and overt dysfunction. Each stage is described and discussed in detail, following the principle that speaking a common language is critical when managing such complex patients in a multi-disciplinary and sometimes multi-centre setting."

Determination of <i>GLA</i> gene variants and identification of genotype-phenotype correlations allow us to explain the features of FD associated with predominant damage of one or another system, both in the classical and atypical forms of FD, as well as in cases with late manifestation and involvement of one of the systems. The study included 293 Russian patients with pathogenic variants of the <i>GLA</i> gene, which were identified as a result of various selective screening programs. Screening was carried out for 48,428 high-risk patients using a two-step diagnostic algorithm, including the determination of the concentration of the biomarker lyso-Gb3 as a first-tier test. Screening of atypical FD among patients with HCM was carried out via high-throughput sequencing in another 2427 patients. 102 (0.20%) cases of FD were identified among unrelated patients as a result of the study of 50,855 patients. Molecular genetic testing allowed us to reveal the spectrum and frequencies of 104 different pathogenic variants of the <i>GLA</i> gene in 293 examined patients from 133 families. The spectrum and frequencies of clinical manifestations in patients with FD, including 20 pediatric patients, were described. Correlations between the concentration of the lyso-Gb3 biomarker and the type of pathogenic variants of the <i>GLA</i> gene have been established. Variants identified in patients with early stroke were described, and the association of certain variants with the development of stroke was established.

    "abstract": "Sex differences in AKI continue to be identified. Generally, women are protected from AKI when compared to men. Much of the protection exhibited in women is diminished after menopause. These sex and age effects have also been noted in animal models of AKI. Gonadal hormones, as modifiers of incidence, severity, and progression of AKI, have been offered as likely contributors to this sex and age effect. In animal models of AKI, estrogen and testosterone seem to modulate susceptibility. Questions remain however regarding cellular and molecular changes that are initiated by modulation of these hormones because both estrogen and testosterone have effects across cell types that play a role in AKI. Although findings have largely been informed by studies in males, molecular pathways that are involved in the initiation and progression of AKI may be modulated by gonadal hormones. Compounding the hormone-receptor effects are developmental effects of sex chromosomal complement and epigenetic influences that may confer sex-based baseline differences in gene and protein expression, and gene dosage effects of X inactivation and escape on molecular pathways. Elucidation of sex-based protection may afford a more complete view of AKI and potential therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the effect on susceptibility to AKI in transgender patients, who receive life-altering and essential gender-affirming hormone therapy, requires greater attention. In this review, several potential contributors to the sex differences observed in humans and animal models are discussed."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inherited lysosomal disorder due to a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-gla) due to mutations in the GLA gene. These mutations result in plasma and lysosome accumulation of glycosphingolipids, leading to progressive organ damage and reduced life expectancy. Due to the availability of specific disease-modifying treatments, proper and timely diagnosis and therapy are essential to prevent irreversible complications. However, diagnosis of FD is often delayed because of the wide clinical heterogeneity of the disease and multiple organ involvement developing in variable temporal sequences. This observation is also valid for renal involvement, which may manifest with non-specific signs, such as proteinuria and chronic kidney disease, which are also common in many other nephropathies. Moreover, an additional confounding factor is the possibility of the coexistence of FD with other kidney disorders. Thus, suspecting and diagnosing FD nephropathy in patients with signs of kidney disease may be challenging for the clinical nephrologist. Herein, also through the presentation of a unique case of co-occurrence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and FD, we review the available literature on cases of coexistence of FD and other renal diseases and discuss the implications of these conditions. Moreover, we highlight the clinical, laboratory, and histological elements that may suggest clinical suspicion and address a proper diagnosis of Fabry nephropathy."

Data mining was consistent with differential expression of genes encoding enzymes from the Gb3 metabolic pathway in human diabetic kidney disease, including upregulation of <i>UGCG</i>, the gene encoding the upstream and rate-limiting enzyme glucosyl ceramide synthase. Diabetic Fabry mice displayed the most severe kidney infiltration by F4/80+ macrophages, and a lower kidney expression of kidney protective genes (<i>Pgc1α</i> and <i>Tfeb</i>) than diabetic wild type mice, without a further increase in kidney fibrosis. Moreover, only diabetic Fabry mice developed kidney insufficiency and these mice with kidney insufficiency had a high expression of <i>Ugcg</i>. In conclusion, we found evidence of interaction between diabetes and Fabry disease that may increase the severity of the kidney phenotype through modulation of the Gb3 synthesis pathway and downregulation of kidney protective genes."

BALANCE (NCT02795676) assessed non-inferiority of pegunigalsidase alfa versus agalsidase beta in adults with Fabry disease with an annualised estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope more negative than -2 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year who had received agalsidase beta for ≥1 year. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta every 2 weeks for 2 years. The primary efficacy analysis assessed non-inferiority based on median annualised eGFR slope differences between treatment arms. Seventy-seven patients received either pegunigalsidase alfa (n=52) or agalsidase beta (n=25). At baseline, mean (range) age was 44 (18-60) years, 47 (61%) patients were male, median eGFR was 74.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and median (range) eGFR slope was -7.3 (-30.5, 6.3) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year. At 2 years, the difference between median eGFR slopes was -0.36 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Minimal changes were observed in lyso-Gb3 concentrations in both treatment arms at 2 years. Proportions of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions were similar in both groups, yet exposure-adjusted rates were 3.6-fold and 7.8-fold higher, respectively, with agalsidase beta than pegunigalsidase alfa. At the end of the study, neutralising antibodies were detected in 7 out of 47 (15%) pegunigalsidase alfa-treated patients and 6 out of 23 (26%) agalsidase beta-treated patients. There were no deaths. Based on rate of eGFR decline over 2 years, pegunigalsidase alfa was non-inferior to agalsidase beta. Pegunigalsidase alfa had lower rates of treatment-emergent adverse events and mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. NCT02795676."

    "abstract": "The clinical manifestations of Fabry disease affect the nerves, kidneys, heart, skin, gastrointestinal tract and eyes. Our aim is to familiarize people with the FD diagnostic process by reporting this case. A 79-year-old-male patient presented with muscle pain and weakness in the extremities, also with an increasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Further examinations revealed that multiple organ involvement, such as rash, myocardial hypertrophy, peripheral neuropathy. Cardiac MR demonstrated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis and low myocardial T1 value. The patient was eventually diagnosed with Fabry disease through proteomics and genetic testing. The treatment is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). But this patient could not afford ERT and was given only general symptomatic treatment, pregabalin, and a gradual reduction in glucocorticoid. The patient's symptoms of joint pain and muscle weakness reduced significantly, and ESR and CRP had decreased to normal. FD is a rare disease and difficult to diagnose, but rare does not mean invisible. FD may present with signs and symptoms of rheumatic diseases. Rheumatologists should be aware and concerned about this disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD, OMIM 301500) is a rare X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder associated with reduced activities of α-galactosidase A (aGal, EC 3.2.1.22). The current standard of care for FD is based on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), in which a recombinantly produced version of αGal is intravenously (iv) applied to Fabry patients in biweekly intervals. Though the iv application is clinically efficacious, periodical infusions are inconvenient, time- and resource-consuming and they negatively impact the patients' quality of life. Subcutaneous (sc) injection, in contrast, is an established route of administration for treatment of chronic conditions. It opens the beneficial option of self-administration, thereby improving patients' quality of life and at the same time reducing treatment costs. We have previously shown that Moss-α-Galactosidase (moss-aGal), recombinantly produced in the moss <i>Physcomitrium patens</i>, is efficient in degrading accumulated Gb3 in target organs of murine model of FD and in the phase I clinical study, we obtained first efficacy evidence in human patients following single iv infusion. Here, we tested the efficacy of subcutaneous administration of moss-aGal and compared it with the results observed following iv infusion in Fabry mice. The obtained findings demonstrate that subcutaneously applied moss-aGal is correctly transported to target organs and efficacious in degrading Gb3 deposits there and thus suggest the possibility of using this route of administration for therapy of Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "<i>Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in</i> JCO <i>or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.</i>Whether adjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) might prevent peritoneal metastases after curative surgery for high-risk colon cancer is an ongoing debate. This study aimed to determine 5-year oncologic outcomes of the randomized multicenter COLOPEC trial, which included patients with clinical or pathologic T4N0-2M0 or perforated colon cancer and randomly assigned (1:1) to either adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and HIPEC (n = 100) or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy alone (n = 102). HIPEC was performed using a one-time administration of oxaliplatin (460 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 30 minutes, 42°C, concurrent fluorouracil/leucovorin intravenously), either simultaneously (9%) or within 5-8 weeks (91%) after primary tumor resection. Outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Long-term data were available of all 202 patients included in the COLOPEC trial, with a median follow-up of 59 months (IQR, 54.5-64.5). No significant difference was found in 5-year overall survival rate between patients assigned to adjuvant HIPEC followed by systemic chemotherapy or only adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (69.6% <i>v</i> 70.9%, log-rank; <i>P</i> = .692). Five-year peritoneal metastases rates were 63.9% and 63.2% (<i>P</i> = .907) and 5-year disease-free survival was 55.7% and 52.3% (log-rank; <i>P</i> = .875), respectively. No differences in quality-of-life outcomes were found. Our findings implicate that adjuvant HIPEC should still be performed in trial setting only."

    "abstract": "Acroparesthesia is a symptom characterized by a subjective sensation, such as numbness, tingling, prickling, and reduced sensation, affecting the extremities (fingers and toes). Despite its frequency, data regarding its diagnostic approach and management are scarce. The etiological diagnosis of acroparesthesia is sometimes challenging since it can be due to abnormality anywhere along the sensory pathway from the peripheral nervous system to the cerebral cortex. Acroparesthesia can reveal several diseases. It can be associated with rheumatic complaints such as arthritis or myalgia. Further cautions are required when paresthesia is acute (within days) in onset, rapidly progressive, severe, asymmetric, proximal, multifocal, or associated with predominant motor signs (limb weakness) or severe dysautonomia. Acroparesthesia may reveal Guillain-Barré syndrome or vasculitis, requiring rapid management. Acroparesthesia is a predominant symptom of polyneuropathy, typically distal and symmetric, often due to diabetes. However, it can occur in other diseases such as vitamin B12 deficiency, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, or Fabry's disease. Mononeuropathy, mainly carpal tunnel syndrome, remains the most common cause of acroparesthesia. Ultrasonography contributes to the diagnosis of nerve entrapment neuropathy by showing nerve enlargement, hypoechogenic nerve, and intraneural vascularity. Besides, it can reveal its cause, such as space-occupying lesions, anatomical nerve variations, or anomalous muscle. Ultrasonography is also helpful for entrapment neuropathy treatment, such as ultrasound-guided steroid injection or carpal tunnel release. The management of acroparesthesia depends on its causes. This article aimed to review and summarize current knowledge on acroparesthesia and its causes. We also propose an algorithm for the management of acroparesthesia."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene. It has a wide range of clinical manifestations, typically related to the specific underlying GLA variant. One of the main features of FD is kidney involvement; therefore, several studies have addressed the prevalence of FD in all types of patients with chronic kidney disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of screening studies in chronic kidney disease patients, including those on dialysis, had undergone a kidney transplantation, and those who did not receive kidney replacement therapy, and assessed the prevalence of pathogenic variants in these cohorts. Fifty-five studies were included, involving a total of 84,062 individuals. Of these, 251 cases were positive for FD; a third of the reported GLA variants were of a benign phenotype (37.8%), followed by classical phenotype (31.7%), late onset (15.5%), and of uncertain significance (14.7%). The overall prevalence among dialysis patients was 0.10% (CI95%, 0.06-0.15), 0.28% (CI95%, 0.06-0.15) among patients with kidney transplantation, and 0.17% (CI95%, 0.11-0.39) among those without kidney replacement therapy. Although the overall prevalence of FD is low in patients with kidney involvement, screening, especially in patients who have not yet undergone kidney replacement therapy, is important, in order to provide timely and effective treatment interventions, including disease modifying therapies. The prevalence of kidney involvement in females with Fabry Disease is lower but this should not lead to inadequate follow up. Further research is also needed on the impact of genetic variants of uncertain significance to elucidate their role in Fabry disease."

In rare cases, FD may coexist with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). We describe a case of concurrent FD, IgAN, and dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the TTN and BAG3 genes, which has not been reported previously. A 60-year-old female patient was admitted with a one-week history of facial and lower-limb edema, two-year history of left ventricular hypertrophy and sinus bradycardia, and recurring numbness and pain in three lateral digits with bilateral thenar muscle atrophy. Renal biopsy revealed concurrent FD (confirmed via an alpha-galactosidase A enzyme assay, Lyso-GL-3 quantification, and GLA gene sequencing) and IgAN. Heterozygous mutations in the TTN (c.30,484 C > A;p.P10162T) and BAG3 (c.88 A > G;p.I30V) genes were observed. The patient reported that two of her brothers had undergone kidney transplantation; one died suddenly at 60 years of age, and the other required a cardiac pacemaker. The 35-year-old son of the patient was screened for the GLA gene mutation and found to be positive for the same mutation as the patient. The patient was administered oral losartan (50 mg/day). Enzyme replacement therapy was refused due to financial reasons. Her renal and cardiac functions were stable yet worth closely monitoring during follow-up. The family history of patients with concurrent heart and renal diseases should be assessed in detail. Genetic testing and histological examinations are essential for diagnosing FD with IgAN."

Characteristic multiorgan manifestations include renal dysfunction (Fabry nephropathy) and associated urinary tract complications. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been available since 2001, but contemporary real-world data are lacking regarding Fabry nephropathy risks and treatment outcomes. This retrospective cohort study analyzed electronic medical records data for 10,637 Fabry disease patients from the TriNetX research database. Kidney and urinary tract outcomes were evaluated over two decades, 2000-2010 and 2011-2020. Outcomes assessed included chronic kidney disease (CKD), urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, obstruction, renal insufficiency, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The prevalence of stage 4-5 CKD nearly doubled between 2000-2010 and 2011-2020, while ESRD prevalence rose over 4-fold. Incidence rates showed similar marked elevations across renal and urologic complications. Females and Black patients experienced disproportionate escalations in kidney and urinary tract morbidity. This large cohort study revealed significantly increased Fabry nephropathy and associated urologic complications over the past two decades, contradicting expectations of reduced morbidity with ERT availability. The findings highlight needs to optimize screening, treatment strategies, monitoring practices, and address disparities to curb rising disease burden and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked disorder due to a pathogenic variant of the <i>GLA</i> gene that codes for the alpha-galactosidase enzyme. The reduced or absent activity of the enzyme results in lysosomal accumulation of globotriosylceramide and its derivative, globotriaosylsphingosine, in a variety of cells, leading to a variety of complications including cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular disorders. Early diagnosis is critically important for the selection of therapeutic treatments, which are essential for improving outcomes. Here we present a case of FD diagnosed at the time of end-stage kidney disease presentation. A 40-year-old man with a history of seizures presented with increased serum creatinine, nephrotic rage proteinuria, and new-onset hypertension. A renal biopsy revealed numerous, whorled, and lamellated cytoplasmic inclusions in podocytes, glomerular peritubular capillary endothelial cells, mesangial cells, arterial myocytes, and interstitial macrophages. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the presence of glycosphingolipid inclusions and enlarged lysosomes packed with multi-lamellated structures (\"zebra\" bodies). The findings were suggestive of a lysosomal storage disorder, and testing for alpha-galactosidase A levels revealed near-absent enzyme activity, confirming the diagnosis of advanced FD. The diagnosis of FD can be challenging as the manifestations of the disease are nonspecific, and patients can present early with classical symptoms or late with non-classical patterns of involvement. We will discuss strategies to identify the disorder early by reviewing the classical and non-classical presentations and further outline currently available and potential future treatment options."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is caused by α-galactosidase A (AGAL) enzyme deficiency, leading to globotriaosylceramide accumulation (Gb3) in several cell types. Pain is one of the pathophysiologically incompletely understood symptoms in FD patients. Previous data suggest an involvement of hypoxia and mitochondriopathy in FD pain development at dorsal root ganglion (DRG) level. Using immunofluorescence and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR), we investigated patient-derived endothelial cells (EC) and DRG tissue of the <i>GLA</i> knockout (KO) mouse model of FD. We address the question of whether hypoxia and mitochondriopathy contribute to FD pain pathophysiology. In EC of FD patients (P1 with pain and, P2 without pain), we found dysregulated protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) 1a and HIF2 compared to the control EC (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The protein expression of the HIF downstream target vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA, <i>p</i> < 0.01) was reduced and tube formation was hampered in the P1 EC compared to the healthy EC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Tube formation ability was rescued by applying transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) inhibitor SB-431542. Additionally, we found dysregulated mitochondrial fusion/fission characteristics in the P1 and P2 EC (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential in P2 compared to control EC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Complementary to human data, we found upregulated hypoxia-associated genes in the DRG of old <i>GLA</i> KO mice compared to WT DRG (<i>p</i> < 0.01). At protein level, nuclear HIF1a was higher in the DRG neurons of old <i>GLA</i> KO mice compared to WT mice (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Further, the HIF1a downstream target CA9 was upregulated in the DRG of old <i>GLA</i> KO mice compared to WT DRG (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Similar to human EC, we found a reduction in the vascular characteristics in <i>GLA</i> KO DRG compared to WT (<i>p</i> < 0.05). We demonstrate increased hypoxia, impaired vascular properties, and mitochondrial dysfunction in human FD EC and complementarily at the <i>GLA</i> KO mouse DRG level. Our data support the hypothesis that hypoxia and mitochondriopathy in FD EC and <i>GLA</i> KO DRG may contribute to FD pain development."

The fluorinated AGAL probe showed high α-GAL affinity with <i>IC</i><sub>50</sub> of 30 nM, high pharmacological selectivity (≥50% inhibition on >160 proteins), and suitable pharmacokinetic properties (moderate to low clearance and stability in plasma across species).

Conventional cardiac imaging is not sensitive enough to detect early signs of LVH in AFD.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) in early detection of cardiac involvement in AFD and monitoring the efficacy of agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta therapy. Thirteen consecutive AFD patients and 12 healthy controls underwent standard transthoracic 2D, color Doppler, tissue Doppler echocardiography, and 2D strain analysis. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS) were measured. Diastolic strain rate (SR) was extracted. Compared to healthy subjects, AFD patients without LVH showed lower levels of GLS (p < 0.001) and SR (p = 0.01), while there was no difference in GCS (p = 0.82). Following treatment, apical circumferential strain (ACS) showed improvement (p = 0.01). In AFD patients without LVH, there was a decrease in global and segmental LS. Higher plasma Lyso-GL-3 concentrations were associated with elevated ACS values after ERT, indicating that ACS in AFD patients without LVH, albeit normal, is involved in early LV dysfunction."

Biosamples at biopsy were assessed for kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1), arginine-to-citrulline ratio in plasma, and uromodulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in urine. We examined cross-sectional correlations between biomarkers and biopsy features and baseline biomarker associations with 5-year changes in biopsy features. Participants' mean age was 30 years (SD 10) and diabetes duration 11 years (SD 5); 53% were women. The mean GFR measured by iohexol disappearance was 128 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 19) and median urinary albumin excretion was 5 μ g/min (interquartile range, 3-8). KIM-1 was associated with most biopsy features: higher mesangial fractional volume (0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1 to 0.9] greater per SD KIM-1), glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width (14.2 nm [95% CI, 6.5 to 22.0] thicker), cortical interstitial fractional volume (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6] greater), fractional volume of cortical atrophic tubules (0.6% [95% CI, 0.2 to 0.9] greater), and arteriolar hyalinosis index (0.03 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.05] higher). sTNFR1 was associated with higher mesangial fractional volume (0.9% [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.3] greater) and GBM width (12.5 nm [95% CI, 4.5 to 20.5] thicker) and lower GBM surface density (0.003 μ m 2 / μ m 3 [95% CI, 0.005 to 0.001] lesser).

Despite the presence of these deposits in multiple organs, the problem of sleep disorders within this population has very rarely been documented. This study aimed to investigate the types and prevalence of sleep disorders among patients with FD. Screening of the following medical databases using key terms was performed on 10 February 2023: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. A total of 136 records were identified. The quality assessment of the studies was conducted by using tools from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). The study included nine studies on sleep disorders in patients with FD. The overall quality of the majority of these studies was assessed as either poor or fair. Among 330 patients, there was a slightly higher representation of female patients (56%). Sleep problems manifested 4-5 years after the onset of FD and sometimes even after 10-11 years. Genotypes of disease associated with sleep problems were rarely described. Within the FD population, the most commonly reported conditions were excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) as well as obstructive and central sleep apnea (OSA, CSA). However, EDS occurred more frequently in FD patients, while the prevalence of OSA and CSA was within the ranges observed in the general population. The studies included indicated a lack of association between organ impairment by primary disease and EDS and OSA. The effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in treating sleep disorders was not demonstrated. The findings of this report revealed the presence of many sleep-related disorders within the FD population. However, very few studies on this subject are available, and their limited results make it difficult to truly assess the real extent of the prevalence of sleep disturbances among these individuals. There is a need to conduct further studies on this topic, involving a larger group of patients. It is important to note that there are no guidelines available for the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with FD."

    "abstract": "Objectives Fabry disease is characterized by the systemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3), which are widely used as biomarkers of the disease. However, few reports have described the relationship of Lyso-Gb3 analogs and Gb3 isoforms with the disease. The present study determined the profiles of Lyso-Gb3 analogs and Gb3 isoforms accumulated in body fluids from various phenotypic Fabry patients to elucidate the basis of the disease. Methods Plasma Lyso-Gb3 and related analogs were measured in 15 classic Fabry men, 6 later-onset Fabry men, 11 Fabry women, and 36 controls, while urinary Gb3 isoforms were measured in 5 classic Fabry men, 5 later-onset Fabry men, 17 Fabry women, and 11 controls, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Furthermore, these values were monitored for a classic Fabry man, in whom neutralizing anti-drug antibodies had developed following enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Results The levels of plasma Lyso-Gb3 analogs/urinary Gb3 isoforms were higher in Fabry patients than in controls, especially in classic Fabry men. However, minor differences in the ratio of each Lyso-Gb3 analog and Gb3 isoform with respect to the total Lyso-Gb3 analogs and Gb3 isoforms, respectively, were observed among individual classic Fabry men. Their time courses were well associated with the development and attenuation of anti-drug antibodies in a patient with classic Fabry disease during ERT. Conclusion Quantification of Lyso-Gb3 analogs and Gb3 isoforms provides us with more detailed information about the substrates that accumulated in the body fluids of Fabry patients than does quantification of Lyso-Gb3 and Gb3 alone, so this approach may be useful for elucidating the basis of Fabry disease."

Before switching to pegunigalsidase alfa, mean (standard error [SE]) annualized eGFR slope was - 5.90 (1.34) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year; 12 months post-switch, the mean eGFR slope was - 1.19 (1.77) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year; and mean plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> reduced by 31%. Seven (35%) out of 20 patients were positive for pegunigalsidase alfa antidrug antibodies (ADAs) at ≥ 1 study timepoint, two of whom had pre-existing ADAs at baseline. Mean (SE) changes in eGFR slope for ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients were + 5.47 (3.03) and + 4.29 (3.15) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, respectively, suggesting no negative impact of anti-pegunigalsidase alfa ADAs on eGFR slope. Pegunigalsidase alfa may offer a safe and effective treatment option for patients with FD, including those previously treated with agalsidase alfa. TRN: NCT03018730.

    "abstract": "Species associated with visceral leishmaniasis, such as L. infantum, may be responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), particularly in the Mediterranean region. In immunosuppressed hosts, classification as complicated CL is essential, as the risk of mucosal leishmaniasis warrants systemic therapy. We report the case of a forty-seven-year-old male living in Portugal, with Fabry disease and receiving immunosuppressive treatment with adalimumab and methotrexate for Crohn's disease. There was no travel history outside of Europe. He presented a two-year-old, 5.5 cm plaque with a well-defined hyperkeratotic elevated border and central, painless ulceration on his back. The biopsy revealed parasites inside macrophages suggestive of Leishmania, and PCR identified the species as L. infantum. A biopsy via nasal endoscopy excluded mucosal involvement. Classification as complicated CL dictated treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and subsequent topical paramomycin. The rarity of CL in Portugal may delay its diagnosis, especially in autochthonous infections. Treatment choice is complicated by the heterogeneity of drugs available worldwide. As the global prevalence of CL increases, it is important to be aware of this diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) sensors are critical to various applications such as the situation where H<sub>2</sub> is used as the clean energy for industry or the indicator for human disease diagnosis. Palladium (Pd) is widely used as the hydrogen sensing material in different types of sensors. Optical fiber H<sub>2</sub> sensors are particularly promising due to their compactness and spark-free operation. Here, we report a Fabry-Pérot (FP)-cavity-based H<sub>2</sub> sensor that is formed with a freestanding Pd membrane and integrated on a conventional single-mode optical fiber end. The freestanding Pd membrane acts both as the active hydrogen sensing material and as one of the reflective mirrors of the cavity. When the Pd film absorbs H<sub>2</sub> to form PdH<sub>x</sub>, it will be stretched, resulting in a change of the cavity length and thus a shift of the interference spectrum. The H<sub>2</sub> concentration can be derived from the amplitude of the wavelength shift. Experimental results showed that H<sub>2</sub> sensors based on suspended Pd membranes can achieve a detection sensitivity of about 3.6 pm/ppm and a detection limit of about 3.3 ppm. This highly sensitive detection scheme is expected to find applications for sensing low-concentration H<sub>2</sub>."

    "abstract": "Molecular diagnosis has undergone rapid and significant advancements in recent years. But because molecular diagnosis can be conducted independently of phenotype, it can engender ambiguity and potential misinterpretations in disease diagnosis. Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, arises from a deficiency in α-galactosidase A. In 2002, Ishii and colleagues uncovered a variant (IVS4+919G > A) deep within intron 4 of the GLA gene that could lead to aberrant splicing of the GLA mRNA. This variant is present in 1:875 males in Taiwan, and many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the IVS4+919G > A variant are currently treated by enzyme replacement therapy, an expensive treatment. Unfortunately, till now only one article published in 2013 described the outcome of treatment. This review summarized the conflicting evidence about the clinical relevance of the IVS4+919G > A variant, and suggest a multifactorial model, rather than a monogenic model, for the involvement of the IVS4+919G > A variant in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The diagnostic dilemma for this Taiwanese cardiac variant in Fabry disease clearly emphasizes the need for precise interpretation and application of molecular diagnostic results."

    "title": "Targeted literature review exploring the predictive value of estimated glomerular filtration rate and left ventricular mass index as indicators of clinical events in Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare, progressive X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused by mutations in the GLA gene resulting in deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), leading to peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, stroke, end-stage renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders and premature death. Given the long-term nature of disease progression, trials in Fabry disease are often not powered to capture these clinical events. Clinical measures such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) are often captured instead. eGFR and LVMI are believed to be associated with long-term Fabry disease clinical events of interest, but the precise relationships are unclear. We aimed to identify published literature exploring the link between eGFR/LVMI and long-term clinical events in Fabry disease. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Embase® and MEDLINE® (using Embase.com), and a targeted literature review was conducted. Studies reporting a quantitative relationship between eGFR and/or LVMI and clinical events in Fabry disease were extracted, and narrative synthesis was conducted to understand these predictive relationships. Eight studies, consisting of seven patient-level retrospective analyses plus one prospective cohort study, met the inclusion criteria. Seven of these studies reported eGFR and six reported LVMI, with five reporting both. All studies presented results for either a composite measure including a range of key Fabry disease clinical events, or a composite outcome that included at least one key Fabry disease clinical event. All studies employed Cox proportional hazards survival modelling. The studies consistently reported that eGFR and LVMI are predictors of key clinical events in Fabry disease, with the findings remaining consistent regardless of the therapy received by patients in the studies. The evidence identified suggests that eGFR and LVMI outcomes may be appropriate indicators for long-term clinical events in Fabry disease, and all identified papers implied the same directional relationship. However, additional research is needed to further understand the specific details of these relationships and to quantify them."

    "abstract": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated drugs are used for medical treatment, since PEGylation either decreases drug clearance or/and shields the protein from undesirable immunogenicity. PEGylation was implemented in a new enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease (FD), pegunigalsidase-alfa (PRX-102). However, exposure to PEG via life-style products and vaccination can result in the formation of anti-PEG antibodies. We demonstrate the <i>de novo</i> formation of functional anti-PEG antibodies in a healthy male after the second mRNA-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, we analyzed the frequency and inhibitory function of anti-PEG and anti-α-Galactosidase A (AGAL) antibodies in 102 FD patients (46.9% males). We identified 29 out of 87 (33.3%) patients with low anti-PEG titers. Sera from patients without anti-AGAL antibodies [n=70] showed a higher rescued AGAL activity of agalsidase-beta and PRX-102 [both p<0.0001] compared to those with anti-AGAL antibodies [n=15]. Sera from anti-AGAL antibody-negative and -positive patients had less inhibitory effects on PRX-102 (rescued activity: 89 ± 6% versus 85 ± 7% and 49 ± 26% versus 25 ± 32%; both p<0.0001). Enzyme stability assays demonstrated that AUCs in anti-AGAL-negative sera (n=20) were 7.6-fold higher for PRX-102, while AUCs of both enzymes in anti-AGAL-positive sera (n=6) were decreased. However, AUC for PRX-102 was 33% of non-anti-AGAL-positive sera treated PRX-102 and 5-fold higher compared to agalsidase-beta. Anti-PEG antibodies had no significant effects on serum half-life of PRX-102, probably due to low titers. Conceivably, therapy efficacy may be superior under next-generation PRX-102 therapy compared to current enzyme replacement therapies in terms of reduced inhibitory effects of anti-AGAL and minor inhibitory effects of anti-PEG antibodies."

A total of 76 eyes (38 patients) and 48 eyes of 24 healthy controls were enrolled in this prospective study. Vessel Area Density (VAD) and Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) area were calculated on 2.9 × 2.9 mm OCTA images scanned with the Heidelberg Spectralis II (Heidelberg, Germany). VAD was measured in three layers: Superficial Vascular Plexus (SVP), Intermediate Capillary Plexus (ICP), and Deep Capillary Plexus (DCP). All scans were analyzed with the EA-Tool (Version 1.0), which was coded in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, R2017b). FAZ area was manually measured in full-thickness, SVP, ICP and DCP scans. Average VAD in SVP, ICP and DCP was higher in Fabry disease patients than in controls (49.4 ± 11.0 vs. 26.5 ± 6.2, 29.6 ± 7.4 vs. 20.2 ± 4.4, 32.3 ± 8.8 vs. 21.7 ± 5.1 respectively, p < 0.001). Patients with cornea verticillata (CV) had a higher VAD in ICP and DCP compared to patients without CV (p < 0.01). Patients with increased lysoGb3 concentration had a higher VAD in DCP when compared to patients with normal lysoGb3 concentration (p < 0.04). There was no difference in VAD in patients with and without vascular tortuosity. However, a significantly higher VAD was observed in patients with vascular tortuosity compared to controls (p < 0.03). Increased lysoGb3 and VAD in DCP could be reliable biomarkers of disease activity. Cornea verticillata could be adopted as a predictive biomarker for VAD changes and disease progression. The combination of cornea verticillata and increased VAD may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for Fabry disease, however due to the discrepancies in VAD values in various studies, further research has to be done to address this claim."

ACD seriously influences patients' appearance and quality of life. Many therapies have been used to solved this problem. However, all the treatments have not been proved very effective. Hemoporfin-mediated photodynamic therapy (Hemoporfin-PDT) was considered recently as a promising treatment for PWS according to the principle of targeted photodynamic destruction of the vascular wall of the lesion. APPROACH: A 27-year-old male patient diagnosed with angiokeratoma corporis diffusum (ACD) by skin tissue biopsy has undergone pulsed dye laser for times, but the result was unsatisfying. After evaluating and obtaining the patient's agreement, we utilized Hemoporfin-PDT with 530 nm LED green light to treat ACD. When followed up in the 1 year after 2 treatments, the patient was pleased with the efficacy that most red papules on his face disappeared. The patient achieved great improvement after two treatments. Hemoporfin-PDT could be used to treat ACD."

Machine learning may enable the timely completion of SLRs and reduce errors by automating data identification and extraction. We evaluated the use of machine learning to extract data from publications related to SLRs in oncology (SLR 1) and Fabry disease (SLR 2). SLR 1 predominantly contained interventional studies and SLR 2 observational studies. Predefined key terms and data were manually annotated to train and test bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and bidirectional long-short-term memory machine learning models. Using human annotation as a reference, we assessed the ability of the models to identify biomedical terms of interest (entities) and their relations. We also pretrained BERT on a corpus of 100,000 open access clinical publications and/or enhanced context-dependent entity classification with a conditional random field (CRF) model. Performance was measured using the F<sub>1</sub> score, a metric that combines precision and recall. We defined successful matches as partial overlap of entities of the same type. For entity recognition, the pretrained BERT+CRF model had the best performance, with an F<sub>1</sub> score of 73% in SLR 1 and 70% in SLR 2. Entity types identified with the highest accuracy were metrics for progression-free survival (SLR 1, F<sub>1</sub> score 88%) or for patient age (SLR 2, F<sub>1</sub> score 82%). Treatment arm dosage was identified less successfully (F<sub>1</sub> scores 60% [SLR 1] and 49% [SLR 2]). The best-performing model for relation extraction, pretrained BERT relation classification, exhibited F<sub>1</sub> scores higher than 90% in cases with at least 80 relation examples for a pair of related entity types. The performance of BERT is enhanced by pretraining with biomedical literature and by combining with a CRF model. With refinement, machine learning may assist with manual data extraction for SLRs."

    "abstract": "Peripheral nervous system is early involved in Fabry disease (FD) and preferentially the small nerve fibers, causing the characteristic neuropathic pain crises usually beginning in childhood. Early detection of this likely underdiagnosed disease is an important approach because causal therapies are available. We conducted a case-series study to investigate the small nerve fiber involvement in FD and its contribution to the diagnosis of the disease but also to the timely effective therapy administration. We used specific structured scales of symptoms and signs to detect peripheral neuropathy, as well as suitable functional and structural tests to diagnose the small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Twenty-seven consecutive patients (14 men, mean age 44.62 ± 10.70 years) with suspected FD were included in this study. Most of the patients presented symptoms of small nerve fiber involvement, which were accompanied by abnormal test results, fulfilling the criteria for SFN. The detection of SFN in our patients allowed the completion of the FD diagnostic criteria and thus the initiation of therapy. In five patients the SFN diagnosis determined the administration of therapy, whereas in two others it might be considered. Our results further suggest the importance of early diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, especially of small nerve fiber involvement, in patients with suspected FD as it contributes crucially not only to the diagnosis but also to the timely effective initiation of FD therapy."

The authors evaluated performance of equations in an independent population of 4050 adults and evaluated other considerations important for implementation. They found that CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are approaching convergence, with better performance of eGFRcr-cys equations in the overall group and fewer differences among race, sex, and age subgroups than eGFRcr equations. Larger differences among eGFRcr equations reflect regional population differences in creatinine, forcing a trade-off between accuracy and uniformity in global implementation of eGFRcr equations. More widespread use of cystatin C could avoid this trade-off. New CKD-EPI and EKFC eGFR equations using eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and both (eGFRcr-cys) have sufficient accuracy for use in clinical practice. A better understanding of the equations, including their performance in race, sex and age subgroups, is important for selection of eGFR equations for global implementation. We evaluated performance (bias and P 30 ) of equations and methods used for equation development in an independent study population comprising 4050 adults pooled from 12 studies. The mean (SD) measured GFR was 76.4 (29.6) ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and age 57.0 (17.4) years, with 1557 (38%) women and 579 (14%) Black participants. Coefficients for creatinine, cystatin C, age, and sex in the CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are similar. Performance of the eGFRcr-cys equations in the overall population (bias <±5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and P 30 >90%) was better than the eGFRcr or eGFRcys equations, with fewer differences among race, sex, and age subgroups. Differences in performance across subgroups reflected differences in diversity of source populations and use of variables for race and sex for equation development. Larger differences among eGFRcr equations reflected regional population differences in non-GFR determinants of creatinine. CKD-EPI and EKFC equations are approaching convergence. It is not possible to maximize both accuracy and uniformity in selecting one of the currently available eGFRcr equations for implementation across regions. Decisions should consider methods for equation development in addition to performance. Wider use of cystatin C with creatinine could maximize both accuracy and uniformity of GFR estimation using currently available equations."

This study sought to classify FD patients into disease stages, based on the extent of the cardiac damage evaluated by echocardiography, and to assess their prognostic impact in a multicenter cohort. Patients with FD from 5 Italian referral centers were categorized into 4 stages: stage 0, no cardiac involvement; stage 1, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LV maximal wall thickness >12 mm); stage 2, left atrium (LA) enlargement (LA volume index >34 mL/m<sup>2</sup>); stage 3, ventricular impairment (LV ejection fraction <50% or E/e' ≥15 or TAPSE <17 mm). The study endpoint was the composite of all-cause death, hospitalization for heart failure, new-onset atrial fibrillation, major bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, and ischemic stroke. A total of 314 patients were included. Among them, 174 (56%) were classified as stage 0, 41 (13%) as stage 1, 57 (18%) as stage 2 and 42 (13%) as stage 3. A progressive increase in the composite event rate at 8 years was observed with worsening stages of cardiac damage (log-rank P < 0.001). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, the staging was independently associated with the risk of cardiovascular events (HR: 2.086 per 1-stage increase; 95% CI: 1.487-2.927; P < 0.001). Notably, cardiac staging demonstrated a stronger and additive prognostic value, as compared with the degree of LV hypertrophy. In FD patients, a novel staging classification of cardiac damage, evaluated by echocardiography, is strongly associated with cardiovascular outcomes and may be helpful to refine risk stratification."

When the GLA gene sequence is altered by mutations that alter the normal DNA sequence, variants of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme are produced, which may or may not function. These mutations are responsible for Fabry disease, and to date, over 800 different mutations of the gene have been described in patients with Anderson-Fabry disease. In this case, we report the case of a woman who is the sole family member with this type of mutation. <b>Case presentation:</b> We report a case of a 52-year-old woman with end-stage chronic kidney disease in dialysis treatment. The patient's alpha-galactosidase activity was 6.6 nmol/ml/h in whole blood, and lyso-GB3 levels were 11.45 nmol/L (normal range < 2.3 nmol/L). Alpha-galactosidase A gene sequence analysis revealed a pathogenic variant of c.947dupT in exon 6, leading to the p. I317NfsTer16 amino acid substitution. The genetic analysis did not detect the same mutation in any of the other screened family members. <b>Conclusion:</b> The international Fabry disease genotype-phenotype database (dbFGP) reports a pathogenic variant c.947dupT in exon 6 that is probably associated with a classical phenotype of Fabry disease. In this case report, we report the case of a woman who is the sole family member with this type of pathogenic variant.

Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the best way to estimate FPW and unbiased stereology, the current gold standard, is time consuming and not widely available. To address this, we developed an automated FPW estimation technique using deep learning. A U-Net architecture variant model was trained to semantically segment the podocyte-glomerular basement membrane interface and filtration slits. Additionally, we employed a post-processing computer vision approach to accurately estimate FPW. A custom segmentation utility was also created to manually classify these structures on digital electron microscopy (EM) images and to prepare a training dataset. The model was applied to EM images of kidney biopsies from 56 patients with Fabry disease, 15 with type 2 diabetes, 10 with minimal change disease, and 17 normal individuals. The results were compared with unbiased stereology measurements performed by expert technicians unaware of the clinical information. FPW measured by deep learning and by the expert technicians were highly correlated and not statistically different in any of the studied groups. A Bland-Altman plot confirmed interchangeability of the methods. FPW measurement time per biopsy was substantially reduced by deep learning. Thus, we have developed a novel validated deep learning model for FPW measurement on EM images. The model is accessible through a cloud-based application making calculation of this important biomarker more widely accessible for research and clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Fabry Disease (FD) (OMIM 301500) is a metabolic X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder that results from the deficient activity of Alpha-Galactosidase A (Alpha-Gal), a lysosomal hydrolase that cleaves neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal N-linked galactosyl moieties, mainly globotriaosylceramides (Gb3). The enzyme, encoded by a 12-kb gene mapping on the long arm (Xq22.1 region) of the X chromosome, is constituted by a glycosylated subunit of approximately 55 kD, synthesized as an inactive precursor that undergoes maturation in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus before being delivered to the lysosome to form a functional dimer. The gene is comprised of seven exons and, so far, >1000 different mutations have been described as associated to FD (www.dbfgp.org/dbFgp/fabry/FabryGP.htm). Clinical phenotypes are divided in two main classes, classic or non-classic, based on clinical and biochemical findings. Non-classic FD, usually recognized as late-onset forms with oligosymptomatic phenotype, presents with symptoms restricted solely to cardiocytes, kidneys or brain associated to missense misfolding mutations. In the group of the non-classic FD, special attention should be given to patients carrying the c.376A > G (p.Ser126Gly) mutation. The lack of clear experimental evidences on its pathogenetic role, despite the clinical pictures of the patients with severe ischaemic lesions, renal involvement and acroparesthesias, led many authors to classify this mutation as inconsistent, non-pathogenetic, and consequently not eligible to the current pharmacological treatments for FD. To shed light on the cellular processes affected by this mutation and to assess if the biochemical pathways involved with, could really have a significant pathogenetic impact, we studied the mutation in silico and in COS-7 and HEK 293 cell models. We found p.Ser126Gly, even retaining both high degree of synthesis and residual activity, is mostly stacked into the ER inducing unfolded protein response (UPR) with reduced trafficking to the lysosome. These data strongly suggest that p.Ser126Gly could trigger a pathogenetic mechanism different from the classic and well assessed increased turnover with loss of biological activity described for other missense mutations. This mechanism seems mainly related to a negative gain of function, with ER retention and UPR activation and could lead, via inflammation and/or apoptosis, to irreversible cell damage."

Existing studies have shown elevated diffusivity in healthy-appearing brain regions that are commonly associated with white matter lesions, suggesting that DWI could help detect white matter lesions at an earlier stage This study explores whether diffusivity changes precede white matter lesion formation in a cohort of patients with Fabry disease undergoing yearly MR imaging examinations during a 5-year period. T1-weighted anatomic, FLAIR, and DWI scans of 48 patients with Fabry disease (23 women; median age, 44 years; range, 15-69 years) were retrospectively included. White matter lesions and tissue probability maps were segmented and, together with ADC maps, were transformed into standard space. ADC values were determined within lesions before and after detection on FLAIR images and compared with normal-appearing white matter ADC. By means of linear mixed-effects modeling, changes in ADC and ΔADC (relative to normal-appearing white matter) across time were investigated. ADC was significantly higher within white matter lesions compared with normal-appearing white matter (<i>P </i>< .01), even before detection on FLAIR images. ADC and ΔADC were significantly affected by sex, showing higher values in men (60.1 [95% CI, 23.8-96.3] ×10<sup>-6</sup>mm<sup>2</sup>/s and 35.1 [95% CI, 6.0-64.2] ×10<sup>-6</sup>mm<sup>2</sup>/s), respectively. ΔADC increased faster in men compared with women (0.99 [95% CI, 0.27-1.71] ×10<sup>-6</sup>mm<sup>2</sup>/s/month). ΔADC increased with time even when only considering data from before detection (0.57 [95% CI, 0.01-1.14] ×10<sup>-6</sup>mm<sup>2</sup>/s/month). Our results indicate that in Fabry disease, changes in diffusion precede the formation of white matter lesions and that microstructural changes progress faster in men compared with women. These findings suggest that DWI may be of predictive value for white matter lesion formation in Fabry disease."

The disease's X-linked inheritance leads to more severe, early-onset presentations in males, while females exhibit variable, often insidious, manifestations, notably impacting cardiac health. This study aims to examine gender-based AFD cardiac manifestations in correlation with the variant type: classical (CL), late-onset (LO), or variants of uncertain significance (VUS). We analyzed data from 72 AFD patients (53 females, 19 males) referred to the \"G.

Females exhibited significantly higher α-Gal A values (median 7.9 vs. 1.8 nmol/mL/h, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and lower lyso-Gb3 levels (1.5 [IQR 1.1-1.7] vs. 1.9 [1.5-17.3] nmol/L, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Regarding the NYHA class distribution, 70% of women were in class I and 28% in class II, compared to 84% and 16% of men, respectively. Among women, 7.5% exhibited ventricular arrhythmias (10.5% in men), and 9.4% had atrial fibrillation (10.5% in men). Cardiac MRIs revealed fibrosis in 57% of examined women, compared to 87% of men. Even among patients without LVH, significant differences persisted in α-Gal A and lyso-Gb3 levels (<i>p</i> = 0.003 and 0.04), as well as LVMi (61.5 vs. 77.5 g/sqm, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and GLS values (-20% vs. -17%, <i>p</i> = 0.01). The analysis underscored older age, decreased lyso-Gb3 deposition, reduced hypertrophy, and lesser GLS compromise in females, suggesting later disease onset. Severe cardiac patterns were associated with classic variants, while more nuanced manifestations were noted in those with VUS. Early GLS impairment in males, irrespective of hypertrophy, emphasized the role of subclinical damage in AFD."

    "abstract": "The cardiac variant of Fabry disease (FD) has high rates of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis due to the lack of systemic symptoms. Here, we report a case of a 68-year-old female with delayed-onset FD presenting as concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with right bundle branch block, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic dysfunction, which was first presented with coronary artery spasm. Early cardiac-specific signs are crucial for diagnosing this disease due to the lack of extracardiac indications and the late onset of symptoms. This case raises a new red flag that patients with unexplained LVH and its atypical electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations accompanied by diastolic dysfunction should be considered for FD. We also recommend further refinement of examinations associated with Fabry disease, which will contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is one of the X‑linked lysosomal storage diseases that can affect any organ. They have a specific lysosomal dysfunction in common, which results in substrate accumulation in lysosomes instead of metabolite degradation. Due to the deficiency/absence of α‑galactosidase, globotriaosylceramides (Gb3) are deposited in lysosomes of the organs. In addition to acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, autonomic dysfunction, vortex keratopathies, ischemic cerebral or cardiac complications and chronic renal failure, also vestibulocochlear dysfunctions with sudden or progressive asymmetric hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo may be observed. In this retrospective study, 33 patients (men = 16 and women = 17) with FD were evaluated. All patients presented to us in interdisciplinary cooperation as part of routine examinations by the specialized center for lysosomal storage diseases of the in-house department of nephrology. This presentation is carried out as a screening examination independent of neuro-otological symptoms. The mean age at diagnosis was 34.76 (±11.55) years. The first presentation in our ENT department was at 40.45 (±11.71) years. We were able to demonstrate a significant correlation between neurological symptoms or apoplexy and hearing loss (p = 0.001) and between cardiac manifestations and hearing loss (p = 0.024). Hearing loss is a potential symptom of Fabry disease and is not limited to the classic male phenotype. Due to possible positive correlations with neurological and cardiological manifestations of the disease, routine ENT screening examinations should be carried out to be able to identify and treat neuro-otological deficits at an early stage. In addition, FD should also be considered and tested as a differential diagnosis, especially in younger patients with sudden unilateral or bilateral hearing loss and a family history."

    "abstract": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a complex disease which describes different kinds of kidney defects, not exclusively linked with podocyte defects. Since nephrin mutation was first described in association with early-onset nephrotic syndrome (NS), many advancements have been made in understanding genetic patterns associated with FSGS. New genetic causes of FSGS have been discovered, displaying unexpected genotypes, and recognizing possible site of damage. Many recent large-scale sequencing analyses on patients affected by idiopathic chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney failure (KF) of unknown origin, or classified as FSGS, have revealed collagen alpha IV genes, as one of the most frequent sites of pathogenic mutations. Also, recent interest in complex and systemic lysosomal storage diseases, such as Fabry disease, has highlighted GLA mutations as possible causes of FSGS. Tubulointerstitial disease, recently classified by KDIGO based on genetic subtypes, when associated with UMOD variants, may phenotypically gain FSGS features, as well as ciliopathy genes or others, otherwise leading to completely different phenotypes, but found carrying pathogenic variants with associated FSGS phenotype. Thus, glomerulosclerosis may conceal different heterogeneous conditions. When a kidney biopsy is performed, the principal objective is to provide an accurate diagnosis. The broad spectrum of phenotypic expression and genetic complexity is demonstrating that a combined path of management needs to be applied. Genetic investigation should not be reserved only to selected cases, but rather part of medical management, integrating with clinical and renal pathology records. FSGS heterogeneity should be interpreted as an interesting opportunity to discover new pathways of CKD, requiring prompt genotype-phenotype correlation. In this review, we aim to highlight how FSGS represents a peculiar kidney condition, demanding multidisciplinary management, and in which genetic analysis may solve some otherwise unrevealed idiopathic cases. Unfortunately there is not a uniform correlation between specific mutations and FSGS morphological classes, as the same variants may be identified in familial cases or sporadic FSGS/NS or manifest a variable spectrum of the same disease. These non-specific features make diagnosis challenging. The complexity of FSGS genotypes requires new directions. Old morphological classification does not provide much information about the responsible cause of disease and misdiagnoses may expose patients to immunosuppressive therapy side effects, mistaken genetic counseling, and misguided kidney transplant programs."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare hereditary lysosomal storage disease caused by the deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A (α-GLA). Although sensorineural hearing loss is common in Fabry disease, there are no studies in the literature that have screened a population with sensorineural hearing loss for Fabry disease. In this study, we aimed to screen a group of patients who were diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss and underwent a hearing test for Fabry disease. One hundred sixty eight patients who were aged 18-75 years and diagnosed with idiopathic hearing loss between July 2019 and January 2020 were included. In male patients, α-GLA enzyme activity was analyzed. Patients with low enzyme activity were identified and genetic testing was performed for mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene. In females, only genetic testing was performed. Eighty four women and 84 men were included in the study. α-GLA enzyme activity was low in 11 of the 84 male patients (13%). One out of these 11 patients had a gene mutation for Fabry disease. Moreover, four relatives of this index patient were diagnosed with Fabry disease in family screening. GLA gene mutation was also found in one of the 84 female patients. Consequently, two (1.2%) of our 168 patients were diagnosed with Fabry disease by screening with enzyme activity and genetic testing. Our study showed that screening for Fabry disease in patients with idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss without other specific findings might be a useful strategy for detecting new cases."

The addition of the oral chaperone therapy migalastat to the available treatment options for Fabry disease is not yet universally reflected in all treatment guidelines. These consensus recommendations are intended to provide guidance for the treatment and monitoring of patients with Fabry disease receiving migalastat. A modified Delphi process was conducted to determine consensus on treatment decisions and monitoring of patients with Fabry disease receiving migalastat. The multidisciplinary panel comprised 14 expert physicians across nine specialties and two patients with Fabry disease. Two rounds of Delphi surveys were completed and recommendations on the use of biomarkers, multidisciplinary monitoring, and treatment decisions were generated based on statements that reached consensus. The expert panel reached consensus agreement on 49 of 54 statements, including 16 that reached consensus in round 1. Statements that reached consensus agreement are summarized in recommendations for migalastat treatment and monitoring, including baseline and follow-up assessments and frequency. All patients with Fabry disease and an amenable mutation may initiate migalastat treatment if they have evidence of Fabry-related symptoms and/or organ involvement. Treatment decisions should include holistic assessment of the patient, considering clinical symptoms and organ involvement as well as patient-reported outcomes and patient preference. The reliability of α-Gal A and globotriaosylsphingosine as pharmacodynamic response biomarkers remains unclear. These recommendations build on previously published guidelines to highlight the importance of holistic, multidisciplinary monitoring for patients with Fabry disease receiving migalastat, in addition to shared decision-making regarding treatments and monitoring throughout the patient journey.

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy can be the phenotype of storage disorders as Fabry disease cardiomyopathy. In this instance, its recognition through GLA gene analysis and preventive administration of enzyme replacement therapy may reduce heart failure risk of surgical septal myectomy (SSM). A 59-year-old man was referred for SSM as dyspnoea and low threshold muscle fatigue associated to severe left ventricular outflow obstruction (gradient of 100 mmHg) due to both interventricular septal hypertrophy and mitral leaflet systolic anterior motion were not controlled by metoprolol 100 mg bid. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and a complete left bundle branch block. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a preserved left ventricular (LV) contractility (ejection fraction 70%) but failed to reveal reduced T1 mapping and fibrosis of postero-lateral LV wall suggesting Fabry disease cardiomyopathy. Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography documented increased LV end-diastolic pressure but normal coronary arteries. SSM was followed by acute renal and heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction declining to 35%. Histology of SSM showed regularly arranged severely enlarged cardiomyocytes containing extensive vacuoles that were intensely positive to immunofluorescence with anti-Gb3 antibodies and appeared at electron microscopy to consist of myelin bodies suggesting the diagnosis of FD. This entity was confirmed by low blood levels of alpha-galactosidase A (0.8 nmol/mL/h; NV > 1), high values of Lyso-Gb3 (5.85 nmol/L; NV < 2.3), and the presence of the pathogenic mutation c.644A>G in the exon 5 of GLA gene. This study emphasizes the importance of a genetic screening for FD before SSM be considered for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked metabolic disease caused by a deficiency in α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity. This causes accumulation of glycosphingolipids, especially globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in different cells and organs. Neuropathic pain and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and early satiety, are the most frequent symptoms reported by FD patients and severely affect their quality of life. It is generally accepted that Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 are involved in the symptoms; nevertheless, the origin of these symptoms is complex and multifactorial, and the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis are still poorly understood. Here, we used a murine model of FD, the male α-Gal A (-/0) mouse, to characterize functionality, behavior, and microbiota in an attempt to elucidate the microbiota-gut-brain axis at three different ages. We provided evidence of a diarrhea-like phenotype and visceral hypersensitivity in our FD model together with reduced locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior. We also showed for the first time that symptomology was associated with early compositional and functional dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, paralleled by alterations in fecal short-chain fatty acid levels, which partly persisted with advancing age. Interestingly, most of the dysbiotic features suggested a disruption of gut homeostasis, possibly contributing to accelerated intestinal transit, visceral hypersensitivity, and impaired communication along the gut-brain axis."

    "title": "Impact of Structural GLA Protein Changes on Peripheral GLA Activity and Substrate Accumulation in Fabry Disease Patients.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene, leading to decreased/absent α-galactosidase activity. In clinical practice, enzyme activity and substrate/byproduct accumulation play a role in diagnosis and disease-monitoring biomarkers. However, interpreting biomarker levels is not straightforward and can change according to the underlying GLA protein abnormality. Our goals were to understand how disrupting specific protein regions changes biomarker behaviour and to establish specific patterns for individual variants. We analysed data from the Biochemical Genetics Laboratory regarding GLA variants, GLA enzyme activity (in dried blood spots, plasma or white blood cells), plasma LysoGb3 accumulation, and urinary Gb3 excretion. We assessed correlations, trends, and potential predictor models of biomarker behaviour. We assessed 169 hemizygous male and 255 heterozygous female patients. For both groups, substrate accumulation correlates inversely with GLA activity. Variants affecting residues buried within the protein core or the active site were associated with more severe biomarker changes, while those affecting residues that establish disulfide bonds or are glycosylated were similar to other variants. For each non-truncating variant, we also established specific profiles of biomarker behaviour. Finally, we also designed predictor models of biomarker behaviour based on structural variant information. This study provides the groundwork for the impact of GLA protein variation on GLA activity and substrate accumulation. This knowledge is of extreme relevance for diagnostic labs and clinicians, as some genetic variants are challenging to interpret regarding pathogenicity. Assessing whether biomarker changes are in the expected range for a specific variant may help diagnostic evaluation. This study also contributes to recognising non-disease-causing variants, considering their overall biochemical impact, and providing a comparative reference for biomarker discovery studies. In the future, the correlation of these findings with disease severity may be of great relevance for diagnosis and monitoring progression."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) deficiency. The progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide results in life-threatening complications, including renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular diseases. In order to improve health care of FD-patients, knowledge of its predictors is important. The aim of our study was to evaluate health-related quality of life (HrQol) in FD and to identify its independent determinants by exploring a wide range of demographic, social and clinical parameters. In this cross-sectional multicenter study, 135 adult patients with FD were recruited at three specialized European centers in Germany and Switzerland. Demographics, social status and clinical parameters as well as data on HrQol (EQ5D, EQ VAS) and depression were collected by means of self-reporting questionnaires and confirmed by medical records. HrQol and its predictors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression analyses. The study population consisted of 78 female and 57 male FD patients (median age 48 yrs) of whom 80.7% (N = 109) were on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and 10.4% (N = 14) were on chaperone treatment. Univariate analysis revealed various factors reducing HrQol such as age > 40 years, classic phenotype, organ involvement (kidney and heart disease, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), gastrointestinal disturbances), depression, and burning limb pain. However, only the following factors were identified as independent predictors of decreased HrQol: classic phenotype, kidney and heart disease, stroke/TIA, depression, and burning limb pain. ERT and chaperone therapy were independent determinants of increased HrQol. Modifiable factors, such as burning limb pain and depression, identified as independent predictors of HrQol-deterioration should be addressed in programs aiming to improve HrQol in FD. A multidisciplinary approach is essential in FD-patients since diverse organ involvement prominently compromises HrQol in affected patients. Our findings showed that the classic phenotype is a strong predictor of worsening HrQol."

The left atrium (LA) is emerging as a potential marker of disease severity in both cardiomyopathies. The present study compares HCM and FD cardiomyopathy with similar degree of LVH, exploring LA morpho-functional parameters and the correlates of clinical outcome. We performed a comprehensive CMR-based comparison between 30 HCM and 30 FD patients matched on age, sex, BSA, LV mass and major cardiovascular risk factors affecting LA remodeling (arterial hypertension and diabetes). 30 healthy controls were also included. CMR feature tracking (CMR-FT) analysis, T1 mapping and conventional parameters were evaluated. Patients also underwent transthoracic echocardiography for LV diastolic function assessment. Clinical events at follow-up were collected (atrial and ventricular events, bradyarrhythmia, heart failure (HF) hospitalization and death). HCM patients showed greater LA remodeling compared to FD patients, namely higher LA end-systolic volume index (LAVi max), lower LA-ejection fraction (LA-EF) and worse reservoir (εs) and booster function (εa) (all p < 0.05). Accordingly, these parameters have demonstrated good potential for distinguishing between FD and HCM (AUC 0.68-0.73, all p < 0.05), with LAVi max being an independent predictor for HCM diagnosis (OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.011-1.132, p 0.02). Moreover, in HCM patients a significant association between εs and HF occurrence was observed at 2-year follow-up (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.72-0.99, p 0.04). In HCM, LA remodeling is greater than in FD cardiomyopathy with similar LVH, and reservoir strain is associated with HF at follow-up."

Intralysosomal deposits were found in all biopsies, corresponding to the skin, kidney, and endomyocardium in both sexes and at different ages. In nine of the skin biopsies, deposits were analysed by immunofluorescence and quantified at the ultrastructural level. Then, the findings were compared according to sex, genotype, and treatment. The quantification of the deposits in the skin biopsies revealed a broader involvement in men than in women. A significant clearance of the deposits was observed in one case after treatment. Tissue involvement was remarkable at diagnosis in all individuals. The findings from the skin biopsies were demonstrative of classic FD, thus supporting the diagnosis; repeated biopsy analyses suggested the benefit of early treatment."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive multisystemic disease characterized by a lysosomal enzyme deficiency. A lack of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity results in the progressive systemic accumulation of its substrates, including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3), which results in renal, cardiac, and/or cerebrovascular disease and early death. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the current standard of care for FD; however, it has important limitations, including a low half-life, limited distribution, and requirement of lifelong biweekly infusions of recombinant enzymes. Herein, we evaluated a gene therapy approach using an episomal adeno-associated viral 2/8 (AAV2/8) vector that encodes the human GLA cDNA driven by a liver-specific expression cassette in a mouse model of FD that lacks α-Gal A activity and progressively accumulates Gb3 and Lyso-Gb3 in plasma and tissues. A pharmacology and toxicology study showed that administration of AAV2/8-hGLA vectors (AAV2/8-hGLA) in FD mice without immunosuppression resulted in significantly increased plasma and tissue α-Gal A activity and substantially normalized Gb3 and Lyso-Gb3 content. Moreover, the plasma enzymatic activity of α-Gal A continued to be stably expressed for up to 38 weeks and sometimes even longer, indicating that AAV2/8-hGLA is effective in treating FD mice, and that α-Gal A is continuously and highly expressed in the liver, secreted into plasma, and absorbed by various tissues. These findings provide a basis for the clinical development of AAV2/8-hGLA."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, resulting in reduced or lack of α-galactosidase A activity. This results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other glycosphingolipids in lysosomes causing cellular impairment and organ failures. While current therapies focus on reversing Gb3 accumulation, they do not address the altered cellular signaling in FD. Therefore, this study aims to explore Gb3-independent mechanisms of kidney damage in Fabry disease and identify potential biomarkers. To investigate these mechanisms, we utilized a zebrafish (ZF) gla<sup>-/-</sup> mutant (MU) model. ZF naturally lack A4GALT gene and, therefore, cannot synthesize Gb3. We obtained kidney samples from both wild-type (WT) (n = 8) and MU (n = 8) ZF and conducted proteome profiling using untargeted mass spectrometry. Additionally, we examined mitochondria morphology and cristae morphology using electron microscopy. To assess oxidative stress, we measured total antioxidant activity. Finally, immunohistochemistry was conducted on kidney samples to validate specific proteins. Our proteomics analysis of renal tissues from zebrafish revealed downregulation of lysosome and mitochondrial-related proteins in gla<sup>-/-</sup> MU renal tissues, while energy-related pathways including carbon, glycolysis, and galactose metabolisms were disturbed. Moreover, we observed abnormal mitochondrial shape, disrupted cristae morphology, altered mitochondrial volume and lower antioxidant activity in gla<sup>-/-</sup> MU ZF. These results suggest that the alterations observed at the proteome and mitochondrial level closely resemble well-known GLA mutation-related alterations in humans. Importantly, they also unveil novel Gb3-independent pathogenic mechanisms in Fabry disease. Understanding these mechanisms could potentially lead to the development of innovative drug screening approaches. Furthermore, the findings pave the way for identifying new clinical targets, offering new avenues for therapeutic interventions in Fabry disease. The zebrafish gla<sup>-/-</sup> mutant model proves valuable in elucidating these mechanisms and may contribute significantly to advancing our knowledge of this disorder."

    "abstract": "In recent decades there has been a large focus on understanding the mechanisms of peripheral immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) in neuroinflammatory diseases. This intense research led to several immunomodulatory therapies to attempt to regulate immune cell infiltration at the blood brain barrier (BBB), the choroid plexus (ChP) epithelium, and the glial barrier. The fate of these infiltrating immune cells depends on both the neuroinflammatory environment and their type-specific interactions with innate cells of the CNS. Although the fate of the majority of tissue infiltrating immune cells is death, a percentage of these cells could become tissue resident immune cells. Additionally, key populations of immune cells can possess the ability to \"drain\" out of the CNS and act as messengers reporting signals from the CNS toward peripheral lymphatics. Recent data supports that the meningeal lymphatic system is involved not just in fluid homeostatic functions in the CNS but also in facilitating immune cell migration, most notably dendritic cell migration from the CNS to the meningeal borders and to the draining cervical lymph nodes. Similar to the peripheral sites, draining immune cells from the CNS during neuroinflammation have the potential to coordinate immunity in the lymph nodes and thus influence disease. Here in this review, we will evaluate evidence of immune cell drainage from the brain via the meningeal lymphatics and establish the importance of this in animal models and humans. We will discuss how targeting immune cells at sites like the meningeal lymphatics could provide a new mechanism to better provide treatment for a variety of neurological conditions."

Early detection is important, because timely initiation of treatments can improve the disease status and prevent complications. However disease manifestations develop in childhood, diagnosis is delayed until adulthood partly due to the limitations of the currently used diagnostic pathway. The aim of this research is to develop and validate a multiplex assay and defining reference ranges, which do not exist at this moment, to improve and facilitate the entire diagnostic work up and enable treatment in an earlier stage of disease. Biomarkers glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) were detected and quantified using LC-MS/MS on dried blood spots. We developed an improved and new extraction method that allowed to measure GlcSph and Lyso-Gb3 in a multiplex analytical platform. After validation of the method, samples of 1480 individuals with normal enzymatic activity were collected to determine age and gender-related reference ranges.Our combination method showed a good linearity, precision, accuracy and limit of quantification with lack of carry-over following the specific international CLSI guidelines. The suggested protocol is robust, efficient, sensitive, specific, comprehensive and relatively cheap in order to accelerate the diagnostic process for both lysosomal storage diseases. The samples, with normal enzymatic activity, defined statistical relevant and clinical correct reference ranges for each specific age group by gender.

Moreover, no generalized venous or capillary malformations have been treated with topical sirolimus. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical sirolimus for venous and capillary malformations and to compare the efficacy of topical and systemic sirolimus therapy, an open-label single-arm pilot study with 0.2% sirolimus gel was conducted from July 19, 2019, to January 30, 2020, in four patients diagnosed with different vascular malformations (blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, common venous malformation, phakomatosis pigmentovascularis type IVb, and angiokeratoma in Fabry disease). The primary endpoint was the safety evaluation of sirolimus gel. The main secondary endpoint was the improvement rate evaluated by the Central Judgment Committee at 12 weeks using photographs. No adverse events were observed. Blood sirolimus was not detected in any patient. Two patients (50%) had mild improvement, and the remaining two patients (50%) showed no change after 12 weeks of treatment. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, a generalized venous malformation, showed the greatest response. In conclusion, 0.2% sirolimus gel was found to be as clinically effective as systemic sirolimus treatment in patients with venous and capillary malformations and more effective for early active lesions, even systemic venous malformations."

Disease-specific therapy, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and chaperone therapy (migalastat), is recommended for patients exhibiting cardiovascular involvement, but its efficacy for modulating cardiovascular disease expression and optimal timing of initiation remains to be fully established. We therefore aimed to systematically review and evaluate the effectiveness of disease-specific therapy compared with placebo, and to no intervention, for the cardiovascular manifestations of Fabry disease. Eight databases were searched from inception using a combination of relevant medical subject headings and keywords. Randomised, non-randomised studies with a comparator group and non-randomised studies without a comparator group were included. Studies were screened for eligibility and assessed for bias by two independent authors. The primary outcome comprised clinical cardiovascular events. Secondary outcomes included myocardial histology and measurements of cardiovascular structure, function and tissue characteristics. 72 studies were included, comprising 7 randomised studies of intervention, 16 non-randomised studies of intervention with a comparator group and 49 non-randomised studies of intervention without a comparator group. Randomised studies were not at serious risk of bias, but the others were at serious risk. Studies were highly heterogeneous in their design, outcome measurements and findings, which made assessment of disease-specific therapy effectiveness difficult. It remains unclear whether disease-specific therapy sufficiently impacts the cardiovascular manifestations of Fabry disease. Further work, ideally in larger cohorts, with more standardised clinical and phenotypic outcomes, the latter measured using contemporary techniques, are required to fully elucidate the cardiovascular impact of disease-specific therapy.

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked genetic lysosomal disease, in which a deficit in the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme results in lysosomal build-up of globotriaosylceramide in several organs, causing cardiac, renal and cerebrovascular complications. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of papillary muscle hypertrophy (PMH) in patients with FD. A group of 63 patients with FD and a positive genetic diagnosis were studied and were divided into two groups: one included 24 patients with FD and LVH and another group included 39 patients with FD and without LVH. Papillary muscles were measured from the left parasternal short axis view, defining PMH as a diastolic thickness greater than 11 mm in any diameter. Patients with FD and LVH had a high prevalence of anterolateral PMH (66.6%), and such prevalence was lower for the posteromedial PMH (33.3%). However, patients who had not yet developed LVH had a high prevalence of anterolateral PMH (33.3%). Patients with FD in the pre-clinical stage (without LVH) have a high prevalence of PMH, especially involving the anterolateral papillary muscle. This finding could be an early marker for the development of LVH, allowing to suspect the disease during its early stages, and begin enzyme replacement therapy in the appropriate patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene encoding α-galactosidase (α-Gal)-A. We evaluated long-term safety/efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa, a novel PEGylated α-Gal-A enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) now approved for FD. In a phase-1/2 dose-ranging study, 15 ERT-naive adults with FD completed 12 months of pegunigalsidase alfa and enrolled in this 60-month open-label extension of 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa infusions every 2 weeks. Fifteen patients enrolled (8 males; 7 females); 10 completed ≥48 months (60 months total treatment), and 2 completed 60 months (72 months total treatment). During treatment, most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild/moderate in severity and all infusion-related reactions were mild/moderate in severity. Four patients were transiently positive for anti-pegunigalsidase alfa IgG. Patients showed continuous reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 concentrations with mean (standard error) reduction of 76.1 [25.1] ng/mL from baseline to month 24. At 60 months, the estimated glomerular filtration rate slope was comparable to that observed in patients treated with other ERTs. Cardiac function assessments revealed stability; no cardiac fibrosis was observed. In this first long-term assessment of pegunigalsidase alfa administration in patients with FD, we found favorable safety/efficacy. Our data suggest long-term continuous benefits of pegunigalsidase alfa treatment in adults with FD."

    "title": "Treatment of Fabry Nephropathy: A Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder with a deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity, which results in the intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids in various organs. Fabry nephropathy is one of the major complications of Fabry disease, and kidney damage is often related to cardiovascular disease and mortality. The treatment of Fabry nephropathy thus helps prolong life expectancy. Two treatment options for Fabry nephropathy and cardiopathy are now commercially available: enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase α agalsidase β, and a biosimilar of agalsidase β) and pharmacological chaperone therapy (migalastat). In this review, we summarize the efficacy of these treatment options for Fabry nephropathy with respect to renal function, proteinuria, and renal pathological findings. We also describe the importance of adjunctive therapy for Fabry nephropathy."

    "title": "Pharmacological Nephroprotection in Non-Diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease-Clinical Practice Position Statement of the Polish Society of Nephrology.",
    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a modern epidemic worldwide. Introducing renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (i.e., ACEi or ARB) not only as blood-pressure-lowering agents, but also as nephroprotective drugs with antiproteinuric potential was a milestone in the therapy of CKD. For decades, this treatment remained the only proven strategy to slow down CKD progression. This situation changed some years ago primarily due to the introduction of drugs designed to treat diabetes that turned into nephroprotective strategies not only in diabetic kidney disease, but also in CKD unrelated to diabetes. In addition, several drugs emerged that precisely target the pathogenetic mechanisms of particular kidney diseases. Finally, the role of metabolic acidosis in CKD progression (and not only the sequelae of CKD) came to light. In this review, we aim to comprehensively discuss all relevant therapies that slow down the progression of non-diabetic kidney disease, including the lowering of blood pressure, through the nephroprotective effects of ACEi/ARB and spironolactone independent from BP lowering, as well as the role of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors, acidosis correction and disease-specific treatment strategies. We also briefly address the therapies that attempt to slow down the progression of CKD, which did not confirm this effect. We are convinced that our in-depth review with practical statements on multiple aspects of treatment offered to non-diabetic CKD fills the existing gap in the available literature. We believe that it may help clinicians who take care of CKD patients in their practice. Finally, we propose the strategy that should be implemented in most non-diabetic CKD patients to prevent disease progression."

    "abstract": "The treatment landscape for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is rapidly evolving. An increase in the number of preclinical and clinical studies in the last decade has demonstrated that pharmacological chaperones are a feasible alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for individuals with LSDs. A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess the evidence from preclinical and clinical applications of pharmacological chaperones in the treatment of LSDs and to elucidate the mechanisms by which they could be effective in clinical practice. Publications were screened according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Fifty-two articles evaluating 12 small molecules for the treatment of seven LSDs are included in this review. Overall, a substantial amount of preclinical and clinical data support the potential of pharmacological chaperones as treatments for Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Pompe disease. Most of the available clinical evidence evaluated migalastat for the treatment of Fabry disease. There was a lack of consistency in the terminology used to describe pharmacological chaperones in the literature. Therefore, the new small molecule chaperone (SMC) classification system is proposed to inform a standardized approach for new, emerging small molecule therapies in LSDs."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by α-galactosidase A deficiency, resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) and its metabolite globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb-3). Cardiovascular complications and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are the most frequent manifestations of FD. While an echocardiogram and cardiac MRI are clinical tools to assess cardiac involvement, hypertrophic pattern variations and fibrosis make it crucial to identify biomarkers to predict early cardiac outcomes. This study aims to investigate potential biomarkers associated with HCM in FD: transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), TGF-β active form (a-TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) in 45 patients with FD, categorized into cohorts based on the HCM severity. TGF-β1, a-TGF-β, FGF2, and VEGF-A were elevated in FD. While the association of TGF-β1 with HCM was not gender-related, VEGF was elevated in males with FD and HCM. Female patients with abnormal electrocardiograms but without overt HCM also have elevated TGF-β1. Lyso-Gb3 is correlated with TGF-β1, VEGF-A, and a-TGF-β1. Elevation of TGF-β1 provides evidence of the chronic inflammatory state as a cause of myocardial fibrosis in FD patients; thus, it is a potential marker of early cardiac fibrosis detected even prior to hypertrophy. TGF-β1 and VEGF biomarkers may be prognostic indicators of adverse cardiovascular events in FD."

    "abstract": "The R356W GLA variant is an ultra-rare cause of Fabry disease (FD). The clinical manifestations of adult patients carrying this variant have never been reported. This study aims to describe the clinical phenotype of the R356W GLA variant. The cohort consisted of consecutive patients diagnosed with FD and carrying the R356W GLA variant. An observational, longitudinal, retrospective cohort study design was used. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging data have been collected from the baseline evaluation to the last clinical review. Six families, including 36 patients with FD and the R356W GLA variant (age 41.1 ± 15.9 years, 67% females), were evaluated. Eleven patients (31%) showed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and 6 (17%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with LVH were older (53.4 ± 8.5 vs. 35.7 ± 15.5, p-value 0.001), showed a higher prevalence of CKD (45% vs. 4%, p-value 0.002), and worse structural and functional cardiac parameters at echocardiographic evaluation. During a median follow-up of 42 (IQR 21-98) months, one patient experienced advanced atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation and one end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. No patients experienced major adverse events. This study suggests that the R356W GLA variant could be a late-onset FD-causing variant with incomplete penetrance and predominantly cardiac manifestations."

    "abstract": "Recent studies in non-human model systems have shown therapeutic potential of nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) treatments for lysosomal storage diseases. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a modRNA treatment to restore the expression of the galactosidase alpha (GLA), which codes for α-Galactosidase A (α-GAL) enzyme, in a human cardiac model generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two individuals with Fabry disease. Consistent with the clinical phenotype, cardiomyocytes from iPSCs derived from Fabry-affected individuals showed accumulation of the glycosphingolipid Globotriaosylceramide (GB3), which is an α-galactosidase substrate. Furthermore, the Fabry cardiomyocytes displayed significant upregulation of lysosomal-associated proteins. Upon GLA modRNA treatment, a subset of lysosomal proteins were partially restored to wild-type levels, implying the rescue of the molecular phenotype associated with the Fabry genotype. Importantly, a significant reduction of GB3 levels was observed in GLA modRNA-treated cardiomyocytes, demonstrating that α-GAL enzymatic activity was restored. Together, our results validate the utility of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from affected individuals as a model to study disease processes in Fabry disease and the therapeutic potential of GLA modRNA treatment to reduce GB3 accumulation in the heart."

A genotype-first approach can identify individuals at risk for morbidity and mortality from undiagnosed IMDs and can lead to protocols that improve clinical detection, counseling, and management. Using data from 57,340 participants in two hospital biobanks, we assessed the frequency and phenotypes of individuals with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PLPVs) in two IMD genes: <i>GLA</i>, associated with Fabry disease, and <i>OTC</i>, associated with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Approximately 1 in 19,100 participants harbored an undiagnosed PLPV in <i>GLA</i> or <i>OTC</i>. We identified three individuals (2 male, 1 female) with PLPVs in <i>GLA</i>, all of whom were undiagnosed, and three individuals (3 female) with PLPVs in <i>OTC</i>, two of whom were undiagnosed. All three individuals with PLPVs in <i>GLA</i> (100%) had symptoms suggestive of mild Fabry disease, and one individual (14.2%) had an ischemic stroke at age 33, likely indicating the presence of classic disease. No individuals with PLPVs in <i>OTC</i> had documented hyperammonemia despite exposure to catabolic states, but all (100%) had chronic symptoms suggestive of attenuated disease, including mood disorders and migraines. Our findings suggest that <i>GLA</i> and <i>OTC</i> variants identified via a genotype-first approach are of high penetrance and that population screening of these genes can be used to facilitate stepwise phenotyping and appropriate care."

Whether GI manifestations are a result of gut dysmotility is undetermined. We aimed to explore GI manifestations in depth and their effect on patients with Fabry disease and to characterize gut motility. We recruited adult patients with Fabry disease reporting GI manifestations. All patients answered a battery of questionnaires covering symptom severity, GI-specific quality of life, and effects of work/productivity and underwent a wireless motility capsule test to measure pan-gut motility. In 48 patients with Fabry disease, abnormal bowel habits and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms. Bloating, nausea, vomiting, and reflux were also prevalent. Neurologic manifestations were found in 95.8% of patients, along with their GI manifestations. Dysmotility was found in less than 35% of wireless motility capsule tests. Colon transit time was associated with constipation severity and Bristol Stool Scale. Several GI symptoms were associated with reduced quality of life, anxiety, and work/productivity, but not Fabry severity score. This is the largest study of GI manifestations in patients with Fabry disease that characterizes gut motility. We found little association between GI manifestations and motility indices, suggesting that visceral hypersensitivity may be a major driver of symptoms. GI symptoms affect different aspects of patients' lives, yet are not always well-discussed or optimally managed in Fabry disease. Disease severity scores when used for therapeutic decision making do not often include GI symptoms or their impact."

Cardiac involvement may comprise of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, heart failure and valvular abnormalities. The goal of this study was to conduct gene analysis for FD in patients suffering from unexplained LVH. 120 patients over the age of 30 who were diagnosed by echocardiography with idiopathic LVH were included in the study. Patients with severe hypertension, intermediate valve disease such as moderate aortic stenosis, known FD, and a family history of autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were excluded from the study. <i>GLA</i> gene mutations were studied by Sanger sequence analysis in all patients. Of the 120 total patients included in this study, 69 were female (58%) and 51 were male (42%). The mean age was 60.3 ± 15.7. <i>GLA</i> gene mutations were detected in three male patients. The detected mutations are as follows: <i>NM_000169.2:IVS6-10G>A (c.1000-10G>A), NM_000169.2:c.937G>T (p.D313Y) (p.Asp313Tyr)</i> and <i>NM_000169.2:c.941A>T (p.K314M) (p.Lys314Met)</i>. Early diagnosis is of vital importance in FD, which can be treated with enzyme replacement. Genetic screening in patients diagnosed with idiopathic LVH by echocardiography is important in the early diagnosis and treatment of FD. Patients over 30 years of age with idiopathic LVH should be screened for FD. Various new polymorphisms can be detected in genetic screening. Identifying new polymorphisms is important for knowing the true mutations in FD."

We aimed to investigate the long-term changes in macular microvasculature and explore a reliable retinal biomarker for treatment monitoring in FD. Prospective study of 26 eyes with FD followed up to 48 months (mean 24, range 8-48). OCT angiography (OCTA) images (2.9 × 2.9 mm) were obtained using Heidelberg Spectralis II at baseline and follow-up. Macular vessel area density (VAD, %) was measured in three layers: superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) in three peri-macular circular sectors (c1, c2, c3). Additionally, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (mm<sup>2</sup>) and horizontal and vertical diameters (µm) were assessed. VAD decreased over time in SVP, ICP (in sectors c2 and c3) and DCP (all sectors) (p < 0.04). VAD reduction was predominantly seen in treated FD patients. FAZ and horizontal diameters increased at follow-up in FD patients compared to baseline (p ≤ 0.025). Correlation analysis showed a moderate to strong negative correlation between VAD of SVP and DCP in the innermost circle and FAZ in treated patients (r = - 0.6; p < 0.0001). This is the first long-term follow-up OCTA study in FD to our knowledge. A decrease in VAD, pronounced in the peripheral circle and deeper layers, as well as an enlargement of the FAZ could be observed over time. These changes reflect the vascular remodelling during the course of the disease. Interestingly, the reduction of VAD was more pronounced in treated patients. This could be a result of enzyme replacement therapy and could be potentially used as a reliable biomarker for monitoring the treatment of the disease. A baseline examination of VAD and FAZ before treatment initiation is meaningful. Larger studies are needed to establish the use of VAD and FAZ as biomarkers for treatment monitoring."

The new siRNA-golden LNPs were efficiently internalized in an FD cell model (IMFE-1), with GNs detected in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Silencing efficacy (measured by RT-qPCR) depended on the final composition and method of preparation, with silencing rates up to 90% (expressed as the reduction in Gb3S-mRNA). GNs conferred a higher system efficacy and stability without compromising cell viability and hemocompatibility. Immunocytochemistry assays confirmed Gb3S silencing for at least 15 days with the most effective formulations.

RV free wall thickness was significantly increased in the AFD group. No significant differences in standard RV indices (TAPSE, transverse diameter, tissue Doppler velocities of the lateral tricuspid annulus) were found. A 3D volumetric analysis showed reduced RV ejection fraction and lower values of longitudinal septal, free wall and global longitudinal strain (GLS) in AFD patients. RV free wall thickness significantly correlated with both free wall RV LS and RV GLS. In multiple linear regression analysis, RV free wall thickness was independently associated with RV GLS even after correction for age and heart rate. <b>Conclusions:</b> In AFD patients, 3D echocardiography allows for the identification of early subclinical functional impairment of RV.

In 39 patients, T1 mapping was positive despite negative conventional techniques (12%). T1 mapping was able in conditions with diffuse myocardial damage such as cardiac amyloidosis, scleroderma, and Fabry disease (additive role in 42%). In contrast, T1 mapping was less effective in cardiac disease with regional distribution of myocardial damage such as myocardial infarction, HCM, and myocarditis.

A thorough dermatological examination was carried out in our 26 FD patients and dermoscopic images (<i>n</i> = 136) were evaluated for specific structures. MSI was used for the evaluation of AKs in seven patients. NLM was carried out to obtain histology samples of two AKs and two hemangiomas. Although AKs were the most common manifestation, the majority of patients presented an atypical distribution and appearance, which could cause a diagnostic challenge. Dermoscopy revealed lacunae (65%) and dotted vessels (56%) as the most common structures, with a whitish veil present in only 25%. Autofluorescence (405 nm) and diffuse reflectance (526 nm) images showed the underlying vasculature more prominently compared to dermoscopy. Using NLM, AKs and hemangiomas could be distinguished based on morphologic features. The clinical heterogeneity of FD can result in a diagnostic delay. Although AKs are often the first sign of FD, their presentation is diverse. A thorough dermatological examination and the evaluation of other cutaneous signs are essential for the early diagnosis of FD."

We have performed a pilot study for six LDs in Brazil by tandem mass spectrometry. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples of unselected newborns were analyzed by the Neo-LSD™ kit (Perkin-Elmer) by MS/MS. Samples with low enzyme activity were submitted to the evaluation of specific biomarkers by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry as the second-tier, and were analyzed by a next-generation sequencing (NGS) multi-gene panel as the third-tier. All tests were performed in the same DBS sample. In 20,066 newborns analyzed, 15 samples showed activity of one enzyme below the cutoff. Two newborns had biochemical and molecular results compatible with Fabry disease, and five newborns had biochemical results and pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS) in GAA. This study indicates that the use of enzyme assay as the first-tier test gives an acceptably low number of positive results that requires second/third tier testing. The possibility to run all tests in a DBS sample makes this protocol applicable to large-scale NBS programs."

Multisystem autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis, would present with proptosis, episcleritis and scleritis, respectively. Myasthenia gravis, while primarily a neuromuscular disease, presents with fatigable ptosis and is associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and giant cell myocarditis. Connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome, which commonly presents with aortic root dilatation, would be associated with ectopia lentis and myopia. Wilson's disease, which is associated with arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, would present usually with the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings. Rarer diseases, such as Fabry disease, would be accompanied by ocular signs such as cornea verticillata and such cardiac manifestations include cardiac hypertrophy as well as arrhythmias. This review examines the interplay between the eye and the cardiovascular system and emphasises the use of conventional and emerging tools to improve diagnosis, management and prognostication of patients."

    "title": "Early Risk Stratification for Natural Disease Course in Fabry Patients Using Plasma Globotriaosylsphingosine Levels.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a very heterogeneous X-linked lysosomal storage disease. Disease manifestations in the kidneys, heart, and brain vary greatly, even between patients of the same sex and with the same disease classification (classical or nonclassical). A biomarker with a strong association with the development of disease manifestations is needed to determine the need for Fabry-specific treatment and appropriate frequency of follow-up because clinical manifestations of the disorder may take decennia to develop. We investigated the levels of plasma lysoGb3 levels over time and its association with disease manifestations and disease course in 237 untreated patients with Fabry disease (median age 42 years, 38% male) using linear mixed-effect models. LysoGb3 levels are stable over time in plasma of untreated patients with Fabry disease. Higher levels of lysoGb3 were associated with steeper decline in eGFR ( P = 0.05) and a faster increase in albuminuria (measured as the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, P < 0.001), left ventricular mass (measured on echocardiography, P < 0.001), left atrial volume index ( P = 0.003), and Fazekas score ( P = 0.003). In addition, regardless of age, higher lysoGb3 levels were associated with higher relative wall thickness ( P < 0.001) and unfavorable functional markers on echocardiography, including septal mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e', P < 0.001) and the ratio of early transmitral velocity (E) to e' (E/e', P = 0.001). In an individual patient with Fabry disease, the plasma lysoGb3 level reached a specific level in early childhood which, in the absence of Fabry-specific treatment, remained stable throughout life. The level of lysoGb3 in untreated patients was associated with nearly all Fabry-specific disease manifestations, regardless of the sex of the patient."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed an association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the enzymatic properties of serum alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) and compared them with the clinical parameters of PD. The study participants consisted of 66 sporadic PD patients and 52 controls. We measured serum GLA activity and calculated the apparent Michaelis constant (K<sub>m</sub> ) and maximal velocity (V<sub>max</sub> ) by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis. Serum GLA protein concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the potential correlations between serum GLA activity and GLA protein concentration and clinical features and the plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) level. Compared to controls, PD patients showed significantly lower serum GLA activity (P < 0.0001) and apparent V<sub>max</sub> (P = 0.0131), but no change in the apparent K<sub>m</sub> value. Serum GLA protein concentration was lower in the PD group (P = 0.0168) and was positively associated with GLA activity. Serum GLA activity and GLA protein concentration in the PD group showed a negative correlation with age. Additionally, serum GLA activity was negatively correlated with the motor severity score and the level of plasma NfL, and was positively correlated with the score of frontal assessment battery. This study highlights that the lower serum GLA activity in PD is the result of a quantitative decrement of GLA protein in the serum and that it may serve as a biomarker of disease severity."

    "title": "Safety and tolerability of agalsidase beta infusions shorter than 90 min in patients with Fabry disease: post-hoc analysis of a Japanese post-marketing study.",
    "abstract": "Agalsidase beta, an enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease, is dosed biweekly at 1 mg/kg body weight, with increasing infusion rates based on tolerability. The US label specifies ≥ 90-min infusions for all patients; the US and EU labels require ≤ 15 mg/hr infusions in patients < 30 kg. The Japanese label allows infusions up to 30 mg/hr, allowing < 90-min dosing for some patients weighing < 45 kg. Japanese post-marketing data were analyzed for rate of infusion-associated reactions (IARs), adverse events (AEs), and serious AEs (SAEs) based on infusion rate and patient attributes (weight, antibody status). Data were available for 436 reduced-duration infusions (< 90 min) and 2242 standard infusions (≥ 90 min). SAEs were rare (0.6%), and the frequency of all safety events decreased over the treatment course. Little impact of infusion duration on safety outcomes was observed: IARs and AEs were numerically more common when infusion duration was ≥ 90 min compared to < 90 min (IARs: 2.0% vs 0.9%; AEs: 2.9% vs 1.4%), while the rate of SAEs was similar (0.4% vs 0.5%). IAR, AE, and SAE frequencies decreased significantly with increasing infusion rates, and this trend was consistent in patients < 30 kg. Safety events tended to be less frequent in patients < 30 kg vs those ≥ 30 kg (IARs: 1.8% vs 2.1%; AEs: 2.3% vs 3.6%; SAEs: 0.0% vs 0.6%), although the differences were not statistically significant. IARs occurred in < 1% of all infusions in the < 30 kg group, 84% of which were < 90 min. More anti-agalsidase beta antibody-positive patients experienced IARs (41.9% vs 30.7%; P = 0.0445) and AEs (61.1% vs 49.3%; P = 0.0497) vs antibody-negative patients; however, there was no significant difference in the frequency of SAEs. In patients with available data, no changes in antibody status were observed after infusion durations were reduced to < 90 min. The results of this post-hoc analysis demonstrated no significant impact of infusion duration on safety outcomes, and no significant difference in outcomes between patients of different weights. These findings suggest that infusion times in patients who are tolerating treatment can, with careful monitoring, be gradually decreased."

    "abstract": "Newborn screening (NBS) programmes identify a wide range of disease phenotypes, which raises the question whether early identification and treatment is beneficial for all. This study aims to answer this question for primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) taking into account that NBS for PCD identifies newborns with PCD and also until then undiagnosed mothers. We investigated clinical, genetic (variants in <i>SLC22A5</i> gene) and functional (carnitine transport activity in fibroblasts) characteristics of all referred individuals through NBS (newborns and mothers) and clinically diagnosed patients with PCD (not through NBS). Disease phenotype in newborns was predicted using data from PCD mothers and cases published in literature with identical <i>SLC22A5</i> variants. PCD was confirmed in 19/131 referred newborns, 37/82 referred mothers and 5 clinically diagnosed patients. Severe symptoms were observed in all clinically diagnosed patients, 1 newborn and none of the mothers identified by NBS. PCD was classified as severe in all 5 clinically diagnosed patients, 3/19 newborns and 1/37 mothers; as benign in 8/19 newborns and 36/37 mothers and as unknown in 8/19 newborns. Carnitine transport activity completely separated severe phenotype from benign phenotype (median (range): 4.0% (3.5-5.0)] vs 26% (9.5-42.5), respectively). The majority of mothers and a significant proportion of newborns with PCD identified through NBS are likely to remain asymptomatic without early treatment. Conversely, a small proportion of newborns with predicted severe PCD could greatly benefit from early treatment. Genetic variants and carnitine transport activity can be used to distinguish between these groups."

    "abstract": "This is the first study to show both dynamic thiol-disulfide balance and oxidative stress levels in patients with Fabry disease (FD). This prospective study consists of 30 FD patients and 30 healthy controls. Thiol and disulfide values of the study groups were evaluated using a new, cost-effective and fully automatic colorimetric method. A total of 60 subjects were included in the study. A statistically significant difference was found between the patient and control groups for native and total thiol levels (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In addition, disulfide levels were significantly higher in FD patients compared with the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.003). Native thiol levels showed significantly negative correlation with lysosomal globotriaosylceramide, total oxidant status (TOS), and oxidative stress index (OSI) levels. In addition, a positive correlation was found between disulfide/natural thiol and disulfide/total thiol ratios and TOS, OSI, and blood urea nitrogen. We found total antioxidant status levels were lower in the patient group compared to the control group, while TOS and OSI levels were higher and were statistically significant. This study highlights for the first time a novel, cost-effective and fully automated measurement of thiol-disulfide levels in patients with FD. Determination of thiol levels can make important contributions to understand the etiopathogenesis and follow-up of the disease in FD patients."

Our study aimed to determine the prevalence (and the necessity of screening) of FD among patients with possible or definite MS. In this prospective monocentric observational study, we included consecutive patients enrolled between May 2017 and May 2019 after the first clinical event suggestive of MS. All patients underwent FD screening using dried blood spots in a stepwise manner combining genetic and enzyme testing. Patients were followed until May 2022. We included 160 patients (73.1% female, mean age 33.9 years). The 2017 revised McDonald's criteria for definite MS were fulfilled by 74 (46.3%) patients at the time of study recruitment and 89 (55.6%) patients after 3-5 years of follow-up. None of the patients had a pathogenic GLA variant, and four (2.5%) had a variant of unknown significance (p.A143T, p.S126G, 2 × p.D313Y). In two of these patients, the intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal bands was absent, and none had hyperproteinorachia or pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid. Detailed examination of FD organ manifestations revealed only discrete ocular and kidney involvement in two patients. The prevalence of FD in the population of suspected or definite MS patients does not appear to be high. Our results do not support routine FD screening in all patients with a possible diagnosis of MS, but there is an urgent need to search for red flags and include FD in the differential diagnosis of MS."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked metabolic storage disorder due to the deficiency of lysosomal α-galactosidase A which causes the accumulation of glycosphingolipids throughout the body. Underweight and low BMI have been occasionally reported in FD patients previously. Whether underweight is common in the early stage of FD and body composition analysis to determine the cause have not been reported. Children who were diagnosed with FD in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from July 2014 to December 2022 were enrolled. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans (DXA) were used to assess body composition (fat mass, FM; fat free mass, FFM and bone mass) according to the International Society of Clinical Densitometry's standard operating method. Whole body muscle mass was calculated as fat-free mass minus bone mass. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was calculated as the sum of the arm and the leg muscle mass. The FM, FFM, ULSM and LLSM indices were calculated by dividing the total FM, FFM, and upper and lower limb skeletal muscle mass (ULSM and LLSM) by the height squared. A total of eighteen children (14 boys and 4 girls) were enrolled. Thirteen boys had the classical phenotype, and five children (1 boy with the N215S mutation and 4 girls) had the late-onset phenotype. Seven children with the classical phenotype (53.8%) and two of the five children (40%) with the late-onset phenotype had abnormal BMIs. Sixteen of the eighteen children (88.9%) had a height in the normal range, suggesting that low BMI was mainly due to underweight. By DXA body composition analysis, the FMI was abnormal in 3 children (2 boys and 1 girl), and the FFMI was abnormal in 12 children (9 boys and 3 girls). For the classical phenotype, 2 of the 13 children (15.4%) had abnormal FMI values, while 10 (76.9%) had abnormal FFMI values. Eight patients (61.5%) with the classical phenotype had a significant reduction in muscle mass index, ASM index and LLSM index values compared with age- and sex- matched Chinese controls. Late-onset patients also had mild low skeletal muscle mass compared to controls. The results suggested that low skeletal muscle mass is common in early FD. This is the first study to examine body composition and muscle mass in early Fabry disease patients. Low skeletal muscle mass is a common early symptom in children with Fabry disease, suggesting that skeletal muscle is significantly affected in the early stages of FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare, X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder, that manifests as a heterogeneous disease with renal, cardiac and nervous system involvement. The most common pain experienced by people with Fabry disease are episodes of neuropathic pain reported in up to 80% of classical hemizygous male patients and up to 65% of heterozygous female patients. No clear consensus exists within UK clinical practice for the assessment and management of pain in Fabry disease based on agreed clinical practice and clinical experience. Here we describe a modified Delphi initiative to establish expert consensus on management of pain in Fabry disease in the UK clinical setting. Delphi panel members were identified based on their demonstrated expertise in managing adult or paediatric patients with Fabry disease in the UK and recruited by an independent third-party administrator. Ten expert panellists agreed to participate in two survey rounds, during which they remained anonymous to each other. Circulation of the questionnaires, and collection and processing of the panel's responses were conducted between September 2021 and December 2021. All questions required an answer. The Delphi panel reached a consensus on 21 out of 41 aspects of pain assessment and management of pain in Fabry disease. These encompassed steps in the care pathway from the goals of therapy through to holistic support, including the use of gabapentin and carbamazepine as first-line analgesic medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain in Fabry disease, as well as the proactive management of symptoms of anxiety and/or depression associated with Fabry pain. The consensus panel outcomes reported here have highlighted strengths in current UK clinical practice, along with unmet needs for further research and agreement. This consensus is intended to prompt the next steps towards developing clinical guidelines."

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disease defined by an increased left ventricular wall thickness not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. It is often genetically determined, with sarcomeric gene mutations accounting for around 50% of cases. Several conditions, including syndromic, metabolic, infiltrative, and neuromuscular diseases, may present with left ventricular hypertrophy, mimicking the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype but showing a different pathophysiology, clinical course, and outcome. Despite being rare, they are collectively responsible for a large proportion of patients presenting with hypertrophic heart disease, and their timely diagnosis can significantly impact patients' management. The understanding of disease pathophysiology has advanced over the last few years, and several therapeutic targets have been identified, leading to a new era of tailored treatments applying to different etiologies associated with left ventricular hypertrophy. This review aims to provide an overview of the existing and emerging therapies for the principal causes of hypertrophic heart disease, discussing the potential impact on patients' management and clinical outcome."

In this study, kidney biopsies of a cohort of 14 untreated children and one treated child were analyzed for their morphologic changes to determine whether early initiation of ERT is indicated. All pediatric FD patients (< 18 years old) diagnosed between 2003 and 2021 in our department who received a kidney biopsy were enrolled. Clinical symptoms; laboratory parameters regarding kidney function, such as eGFR, plasma urea, protein-creatinine, and albumin/creatinine ratio; and 14 kidney biopsies prior to ERT and one under treatment were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 14 patients were enrolled, including 9 male and 5 female children, aged 3-18 years (median age 11). Seven of the enrolled children were 10 years old or younger. Histological analysis of kidney biopsy samples revealed severe vacuolization and accumulation of inclusions in podocytes and renal tubules. The majority of cases had no FD-specific clinical or laboratory features independent of age, gender, or genotype. The youngest FD patient presenting with isolated abnormal kidney biopsy was 3 years old. We demonstrate that histological lesions, typical for FD, can be observed in kidney biopsies at a very young age in patients without classical clinical symptoms or laboratory abnormalities. Thus, we recommend kidney biopsies as a possible tool for early diagnosis of renal involvement in FD. As a consequence of these early biopsy findings without a clinical correlate, an early initiation of ERT should be considered. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information."

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common genetic heart disease and up to 40%-60% of patients have mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes. This genetic diagnosis study aimed to detect pathogenic or likely pathogenic sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric gene mutations and to confirm a final molecular diagnosis in patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A total of 392 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were included in this nationwide multicenter study conducted at 23 centers across Türkiye. All samples were analyzed with a 17-gene hypertrophic cardiomyopathy panel using next-generation sequencing technology. The gene panel includes ACTC1, DES, FLNC, GLA, LAMP2, MYBPC3, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, PLN, PRKAG2, PTPN11, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, and TTR genes. The next-generation sequencing panel identified positive genetic variants (variants of unknown significance, likely pathogenic or pathogenic) in 12 genes for 121 of 392 samples, including sarcomeric gene mutations in 30.4% (119/392) of samples tested, galactosidase alpha variants in 0.5% (2/392) of samples and TTR variant in 0.025% (1/392). The likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants identified in 69 (57.0%) of 121 positive samples yielded a confirmed molecular diagnosis. The diagnostic yield was 17.1% (15.8% for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy variants) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenocopies and 0.5% for Fabry disease. Our study showed that the distribution of genetic mutations, the prevalence of Fabry disease, and TTR amyloidosis in the Turkish population diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were similar to the other populations, but the percentage of sarcomeric gene mutations was slightly lower."

    "abstract": "Differentiating phenotypes of cardiac \"hypertrophy\" characterised by increased wall thickness on echocardiography is essential for management and prognostication. Transthoracic echocardiography is the most commonly used screening test for this purpose. We sought to identify echocardiographic markers that distinguish infiltrative and storage disorders that present with increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, namely, cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), from hypertensive heart disease (HHT). Patients were retrospectively recruited from Westmead Hospital, Sydney, and Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. LV structural, systolic, and diastolic function parameters, as well as global (LVGLS) and segmental longitudinal strains, were assessed. Previously reported echocardiographic parameters including relative apical sparing ratio (RAS), LV ejection fraction-to-strain ratio (EFSR), mass-to-strain ratio (MSR) and amyloidosis index (AMYLI) score (relative wall thickness × <i>E</i>/<i>e</i>') were evaluated. A total of 209 patients {120 CA [58 transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and 62 light-chain (AL) amyloidosis], 31 AFD and 58 HHT patients; mean age 64.1 ± 13.7 years, 75% male} comprised the study cohort. Echocardiographic measurements differed across the three groups, The LV mass index was higher in both CA {median 126.6 [interquartile range (IQR) 106.4-157.9 g/m<sup>2</sup>]} and AFD [median 134 (IQR 108.8-152.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>)] vs. HHT [median 92.7 (IQR 79.6-102.3 g/m<sup>2</sup>), <i>p</i> < 0.05]. LVGLS was lowest in CA [median 12.29 (IQR 10.33-15.56%)] followed by AFD [median 16.92 (IQR 14.14-18.78%)] then HHT [median 18.56 (IQR 17.51-19.97%), <i>p</i> < 0.05]. Diastolic function measurements including average <i>e</i>' and <i>E</i>/<i>e</i>' were most impaired in CA and least impaired in AFD. Indexed left atrial volume was highest in CA. EFSR and MSR differentiated secondary (CA + AFD) from HHT [receiver operating curve-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.80 and 0.91, respectively]. RAS and AMYLI score differentiated CA from AFD (ROC-AUC of 0.79 and 0.80, respectively). A linear discriminant analysis with stepwise variable selection using linear combinations of LV mass index, average <i>e</i>', LVGLS and basal strain correctly classified 79% of all cases. Simple echocardiographic parameters differentiate between different \"hypertrophic\" cardiac phenotypes. These have potential utility as a screening tool to guide further confirmatory testing."

We conducted a systematic review evaluating AF burden and bradycardia requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation and report any predictive risk factors identified. We conducted a literature search on studies in adults with FD published from inception to July 2019. Study outcomes included AF or bradycardia requiring therapy. Databases included Embase, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane. The Risk of Bias Agreement tool for Non-Randomised Studies (RoBANS) was utilised to assess bias across key areas. 11 studies were included, eight providing data on AF incidence or PPM implantation. Weighted estimate of event rates for AF were 12.2% and 10% for PPM. Age was associated with AF (OR 1.05-1.20 per 1-year increase in age) and a risk factor for PPM implantation (composite OR 1.03). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was associated with AF and PPM implantation. Evidence supporting AF and bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation is limited to single-centre studies. Incidence is variable and choice of diagnostic modality plays a role in detection rate. Predictors for AF (age, LVH and atrial dilatation) and PPM (age, LVH and PR/QRS interval) were identified but strength of association was low. Incidence of AF and PPM implantation in FD are variably reported with arrhythmia burden likely much higher than previously thought. CRD42019132045."

This study investigated the associations between selected inflammatory biomarkers and cough reflex sensitivity after capsaicin inhalation in children with mild and moderate well-controlled type 2 endotype asthma compared with non-asthmatic probands. Sensitivity to the cough reflex was measured by recording the cough response after capsaicin inhalation. The sandwich ELISA method was used to measure serum concentrations of the investigated potential inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin 13, interleukin 1beta, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin). The acquired data were statistically evaluated according to descriptive analyses for summarization and comparison between cough reflex sensitivity parameters and individual biomarker values in the observed and control groups modeled by a simple linear regression model. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. We showed a statistically significant association (p-value 0.03) between cough reflex sensitivity - C2 value (capsaicin concentration required for two cough responses) and interleukin 1beta serum concentrations in the asthma group compared with the control group of non-asthmatic children. Our results support the possibility of interleukin 1beta as a potential additive inflammatory biomarker used in clinical practice in children with asthma because of its correlation with the activity of the afferent nerve endings in the airways."

    "abstract": "Fabry nephropathy is characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A, which results in proteinuria and kidney disease. The ineffectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for severe kidney failure highlights the need for early detection and meaningful markers. However, because the diagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease can vary according to the expertise of physicians, we evaluated the opinions of Korean specialists. A questionnaire regarding the management of Fabry nephropathy was emailed to healthcare providers with the experience or ability to treat individuals with Fabry nephropathy. Of the 70 experts who responded to the survey, 43 were nephrologists, and 64.3% of the respondents reported having treated patients with Fabry disease. Pediatricians are treating primarily patients with classic types of the disease, while nephrologists and cardiologists are treating more patients with variant types. Only 40.7% of non-nephrologists agreed that a kidney biopsy was required at the time of diagnosis, compared with 81.4% of nephrologists. Thirty-eight of 70 respondents (54.3%) reported measuring globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) as a biomarker. The most common period to measure lyso-Gb3 was at the time of diagnosis, followed by after ERT, before ERT, and at screening. For the stage at which ERT should begin, microalbuminuria and proteinuria were chosen by 51.8% and 28.6% of respondents, respectively. Nephrologists are more likely to treat variant Fabry disease rather than classic cases, and they agree that ERT should be initiated early in Fabry nephropathy, using lyso-Gb3 as a biomarker."

    "abstract": "Nephropathy is one of the main features of Fabry disease (FD) that leads, in untreated patients with classical mutations, to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from the third to the fifth decade of life. The availability of a specific treatment modified the natural history of FD; in particular, it was widely reported that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is able to slow the progression of the disease. Regarding Fabry nephropathy, several reports have documented an elevated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope in untreated patients as expression of a rapid disease progression towards ESRD. Otherwise, the prompt start of treatment may be beneficial in stabilizing renal function or slowing its decline. Therefore, based on data in the literature about the effects of ERT on eGFR decline and on the evidence supporting the role of eGFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for chronic kidney disease progression, we suggest, in this 'Expert Opinion', that a treatment should be defined effective when eGFR decline is <1 ml/min/1.73 m2/year and not effective when eGFR loss remains ≥3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (≥2.5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year in females). Moreover, practical clinical recommendations and guidance for Fabry patients suggests that a change in treatment may be appropriate if individualized therapeutic goals are not achieved. Since a dose-dependent efficacy has been demonstrated for ERT, we suggest considering a switch to a higher dose of ERT in symptomatic adult Fabry patients (ages 18-60 years) with an eGFR of 45-90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and treated with a stable dose of ERT for at least 1 year, in which a linear negative slope of eGFR of 3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year for males (2.5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year for females) was observed."

Predicted pathogenic variants in <i>GLA</i> occurred in 1 in 3225 of the gnomAD population and 1 in 3478 of its control subset. Predicted pathogenic variants were more common in women than expected (3.1:1), which is consistent with men being excluded from gnomAD because of Fabry complications. Predicted pathogenic variants were not found in members of this cohort with South Asian, Ashkenazim, or Finnish ancestries. Variants identified as pathogenic in the Fabry database were found in 1 in 2651 individuals of the gnomAD database and pathogenic variants from ClinVar in 1 in 4420. The population frequency of 1 in 3225 for undiagnosed men and women with Fabry disease still represents an underestimate because our pathogenicity criteria were rigorous, the cohort did not include already-diagnosed individuals, and whole exome sequencing does not detect intronic variants and large deletions. This study confirms that Fabry disease is more common than previously recognized and still underdiagnosed especially in women."

    "title": "Cardiac magnetic resonance of hypertrophic heart phenotype: A review.",
    "abstract": "Hypertrophic heart phenotype is characterized by an abnormal left ventricular (LV) thickening. A hypertrophic phenotype can develop as adaptive response in many different conditions such as aortic stenosis, hypertension, athletic training, infiltrative heart muscle diseases, storage disorders and metabolic disorders. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent primary cardiomyopathy (CMP) and a genetical cause of cardiac hypertrophy. It requires the exclusion of any other cause of LV hypertrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a comprehensive imaging technique that allows a detailed evaluation of myocardial diseases. It provides reproducible measurements and myocardial tissue characterization. In clinical practice CMR is increasingly used to confirm the presence of ventricular hypertrophy, to detect the underlying cause of the phenotype and more recently as an efficient prognostic tool. This article aims to provide a detailed overview of the applications of CMR in the setting of hypertrophic heart phenotype and its role in the diagnostic workflow of such condition."

    "title": "Management of Hypertension in Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD), a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that depletes alpha-galactosidase A (α-GalA), is caused by mutations in the GLA gene. Diminished α-GalA enzyme activity results in the accumulation of Gb3 and lyso-Gb3. The pathophysiology of hypertension in FD is complex and unclear. The storage of Gb3 in arterial endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells is known to produce vascular injury by increasing oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines as a primary pathophysiological mechanism. In addition, Fabry nephropathy developed, resulting in a decrease in kidney function and contributing to hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension in patients with FD was between 28.4% and 56%, whereas hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease ranged between 33% and 79%. A study using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to measure blood pressure (BP) indicated a high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in FD. Thus, 24-hour ABPM ought to be considered for FD hypertension assessments. Appropriate treatment of hypertension is believed to reduce mortality in patients with FD caused by kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease because hypertension significantly impacts organ damage. Up to 70% of FD patients have been reported to have kidney involvement, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers prescribed for proteinuria are recommended as first-line therapy with antihypertensive drugs. In conclusion, hypertension should be controlled appropriately, given the different morbidity and mortality caused by significant organ involvement in FD patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease resulting from mutations of α-galactosidase A gene, and has been emphasized as one of the etiologies of young stroke and leukoencephalopathy. Vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD) is a highlighted finding in FD. We aim to examine the utility of VBD in Chinese FD by comparing the differences in basilar artery (BA) diameter of Chinese FD patients against age-matched controls with and without stroke. This was a matched case-control study involving 37 Chinese FD patients. The BA diameters were evaluated on axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and compared to two age-and-gender matched control groups, one with stroke and one without. The association between BA diameter and stroke occurrences and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were analyzed among all FD patients. Patients with FD had significantly increased BA diameter compared to controls with and without stroke (p < 0.001). A BA diameter of 4.16 mm could distinguish FD from controls in the stroke subgroup (ROC AUC 0.870, p = 0.001, sensitivity 80% specificity 100%), and with a cut-off of 3.21 mm in the non-stroke subgroup (ROC AUC 0.846, p < 0.001, sensitivity 77.8% specificity 88.9%). Larger BA diameter had more stroke occurrences and was moderately associated with heavier WMH load in terms of higher total FAZEKAS scores. (Spearman's rho = 0.423, p = 0.011). VBD was also present in Chinese FD patients. BA diameter has high diagnostic utility in identifying FD from a mixed cohort of stroke and normal controls, and carried predictive value in evaluating neurological complications of FD."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to review imaging of myocardial hypertrophy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and its phenocopies. The introduction of cardiac myosin inhibitors in HCM has emphasized the need for careful evaluation of the underlying cause of myocardial hypertrophy. Advances in imaging of myocardial hypertrophy have focused on improving precision, diagnosis, and predicting prognosis. From improved assessment of myocardial mass and function, to assessing myocardial fibrosis without the use of gadolinium, imaging continues to be the primary tool in understanding myocardial hypertrophy and its downstream effects. Advances in differentiating athlete's heart from HCM are noted, and the increasing rate of diagnosis in cardiac amyloidosis using noninvasive approaches is especially highlighted due to the implications on treatment approach. Finally, recent data on Fabry disease are shared as well as differentiating other phenocopies from HCM. Imaging hypertrophy in HCM and ruling out other phenocopies is central to the care of patients with HCM. This space will continue to rapidly evolve, as disease-modifying therapies are under investigation and being advanced to the clinic."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare disorder caused by variations in the alpha-galactosidase gene. To a degree, Fabry disease is manageable via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). By understanding the molecular basis of Fabry nephropathy (FN) and ERT's long-term impact, here we aimed to provide a framework for selection of potential disease biomarkers and drug targets. We obtained biopsies from eight control individuals and two independent FN cohorts comprising 16 individuals taken prior to and after up to ten years of ERT, and performed RNAseq analysis. Combining pathway-centered analyses with network-science allowed computation of transcriptional landscapes from four nephron compartments and their integration with existing proteome and drug-target interactome data. Comparing these transcriptional landscapes revealed high inter-cohort heterogeneity. Kidney compartment transcriptional landscapes comprehensively reflected differences in FN cohort characteristics. With exception of a few aspects, in particular arteries, early ERT in patients with classical Fabry could lastingly revert FN gene expression patterns to closely match that of control individuals. Pathways nonetheless consistently altered in both FN cohorts pre-ERT were mostly in glomeruli and arteries and related to the same biological themes. While keratinization-related processes in glomeruli were sensitive to ERT, a majority of alterations, such as transporter activity and responses to stimuli, remained dysregulated or reemerged despite ERT. Inferring an ERT-resistant genetic module of expressed genes identified 69 drugs for potential repurposing matching the proteins encoded by 12 genes. Thus, we identified and cross-validated ERT-resistant gene product modules that, when leveraged with external data, allowed estimating their suitability as biomarkers to potentially track disease course or treatment efficacy and potential targets for adjunct pharmaceutical treatment."

To perform a cross sectional comparison of ECG abnormalities throughout different left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) severity subgroups, providing ECG patterns specific of the progressive AFD stages. 189 AFD patients from a multicenter cohort underwent comprehensive ECG analysis, echocardiography, and clinical evaluation. The study cohort (39% males, median age 47 years, 68% classical AFD) was divided into 4 groups according to different degree of left ventricular (LV) thickness: group A ≤ 9 mm (<i>n</i> = 52, 28%); group B 10-14 mm (<i>n</i> = 76, 40%); group C 15-19 mm (<i>n</i> = 46, 24%); group D ≥ 20 mm (<i>n</i> = 15, 8%). The most frequent conduction delay was right bundle branch block (RBBB), incomplete in groups B and C (20%,22%) and complete RBBB in group D (54%, <i>p</i> < 0.001); none of the patients had left bundle branch block (LBBB). Left anterior fascicular block, LVH criteria, negative T waves, ST depression were more common in the advanced stages of the disease (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Summarizing our results, we suggested ECG patterns representative of the different AFD stages as assessed by the increases in LV thickness over time (Central Figure). Patients from group A showed mostly a normal ECG (77%) or minor anomalies like LVH criteria (8%) and delta wave/slurred QR onset + borderline PR (8%). Differently, patients from groups B and C exhibited more heterogeneous ECG patterns: LVH (17%; 7% respectively); LVH + LV strain (9%; 17%); incomplete RBBB + repolarization abnormalities (8%; 9%), more frequently associated with LVH criteria in group C than B (8%; 15%). Finally, patients from group D showed very peculiar ECG patterns, represented by complete RBBB + LVH and repolarization abnormalities (40%), sometimes associated with QRS fragmentation (13%). ECG is a sensitive tool for early identification and long-term monitoring of cardiac involvement in patients with AFD, providing \"instantaneous pictures\" along the natural history of AFD. Whether ECG changes may be associated with clinical events remains to be determined."

However, only a few studies have reported on bone mineral density (BMD) in FD patients, and the relationship between BMD and clinical factors such as globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) remains unclear. Therefore, the current study sought to investigate BMD in FD patients, the relationship between BMD and lyso-Gb3, and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on changes in BMD and lyso-Gb3. This single-center, observational study included 15 patients who visited our facility for FD between January 2008 and June 2021. We assessed BMD and clinical characteristics in study patients, including plasma lyso-Gb3 levels, and examined the relationship between BMD and plasma lyso-Gb3 levels, and changes in BMD after starting ERT. Male patients' BMD had reduced, whereas female patients' BMD was preserved. Male patients had significantly higher plasma lyso-Gb3 levels than female patients. Moreover, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels were found to be significantly related to the lumbar spine and femoral BMD. These were strongly linked with plasma lyso-Gb3 levels in male patients, whereas no strong link was observed in female patients. Furthermore, BMD significantly increased only in male patients although plasma lyso-Gb3 levels significantly decreased by ERT in all patients. BMD decreased possibly due to Gb3 accumulation, and ERT could increase BMD in male FD patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) encoded by the GLA gene. The symptoms of FD occur as a result of the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), comprising a substrate of α-Gal A, in the organs. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy is a promising treatment for FD. α-Gal A knockout (GLAko) mice were injected intravenously with AAV2 (1 × 10<sup>11</sup> viral genomes [vg]) or AAV9 (1 × 10<sup>11</sup> or 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg) vectors carrying human GLA (AAV-hGLA), and plasma, brain, heart, liver and kidney were tested for α-Gal A activity. The vector genome copy numbers (VGCNs) and Gb3 content in each organ were also examined. The plasma α-Gal A enzymatic activity was three-fold higher in the AAV9 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg group than wild-type (WT) controls, which was maintained for up to 8 weeks after injection. In the AAV9 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg group, the level of α-Gal A expression was high in the heart and liver, intermediate in the kidney, and low in the brain. VGCNs in the all organs of the AAV9 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg group significantly increased compared to the phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) group. Although Gb3 in the heart, liver and kidney of the AAV9 2 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg was reduced compared to PBS group and AAV2 group, and the amount of Gb3 in the brain was not reduced. Systemic injection of AAV9-hGLA resulted in α-Gal A expression and Gb3 reduction in the organs of GLAko mice. To expect a higher expression of α-Gal A in the brain, the injection dosage, administration route and the timing of injection should be reconsidered."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene that encodes α-galactosidase A (α-GAL). Clinical phenotypes tend to vary in monozygotic female twins because mutations are located on the X-chromosome, whereas similar phenotypes are found in male monozygotic twins. Here we report the case of male monozygotic twins with FD presenting with distinguishable renal phenotypes. <b>Case:</b> A 49-year-old male patient who visited the hospital with proteinuria 14 years prior was readmitted for the same issue. His monozygotic twin brother had started hemodialysis 6 months prior due to renal failure of unknown origin. The patient's renal function was within the normal range, while his spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 557 mg/g. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The findings of a renal biopsy were consistent with FD. Genetic testing identified a c.656T>C mutation in the <i>GLA</i> gene, and α-GAL activity was significantly decreased. Genetic screening of his family clarified that his mother, older sister, twin brother, and his daughter had the same genetic mutations. The patient received enzyme replacement therapy 34 times. Subsequently, migalastat was initiated that continues today. Renal function and proteinuria remain stable, and the LVH has mildly improved. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first case of male monozygotic twins expressing different progressions of FD. Our findings demonstrate the possibility that environmental or epigenetic factors may critically influence genotype-phenotype discordance."

In patients with classic FD, sporadic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in the heart and kidney begins <i>in utero</i>; however, until childhood, GL-3 accumulation is mild and reversible and can be restored by ERT. The current consensus is that ERT initiation during early childhood is paramount. Nonetheless, complete recovery of organs in patients with advanced FD is challenging. Two related male patients, an uncle (patient 1) and nephew (patient 2), presented with classic FD. Both patients were treated by us. Patient 1 was in his 50s, and ERT was initiated following end-organ damage; this was subsequently ineffective. He developed cerebral infarction and died of sudden cardiac arrest. Patient 2 was in his mid-30s, and ERT was initiated when the patient was diagnosed with FD, during which the damage to vital organs was not overtly apparent. Although he had left ventricular hypertrophy at the beginning of this treatment, the degree of hypertrophy progression was limited to a minimal range after > 18 years of ERT. We obtained discouraging ERT outcomes for older patients but encouraging outcomes for younger adults with classic FD."

The gradual accumulation of this glycosphingolipid in numerous eye tissues causes conjunctival vascular abnormalities, corneal epithelial opacities (cornea verticillata), lens opacities, and retinal vascular abnormalities. Although a severe vision impairment is rare, these abnormalities are diagnostic indicators and prognostics for severity. Cornea verticillata is the most common ophthalmic feature in both hemizygous men and heterozygous females. Vessel tortuosity has been linked to a faster disease progression and may be useful in predicting systemic involvement. New technologies such as optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) are useful for monitoring retinal microvasculature alterations in FD patients. Along with OCTA, corneal topographic analysis, confocal microscopy, and electro-functional examinations, contributed to the recognition of ocular abnormalities and have been correlated with systemic involvement. We offer an update regarding FD ocular manifestations, focusing on findings derived from the most recent imaging modalities, to optimize the management of this pathology."

Recently, myocardial inflammation of autoimmune origin has been demonstrated in FDCM. The objective of this study was the assessment of circulating anti-globotriaosylceramide (GB3) antibodies as potential biomarkers of myocardial inflammation in FDCM, defined by the additional presence of ≥CD3+ 7 T lymphocytes/low-power field associated with focal necrosis of adjacent myocytes. Its sensitivity was based on the evidence of overlapping myocarditis at left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. From January 1996 to December 2021, 85 patients received a histological diagnosis of FDCM in our department and 48 (56.5%) of them had an overlapping myocardial inflammation with negative PCR for common cardiotropic viruses, positive antiheart, and antimyosin abs. The presence of anti-GB3 antibodies was evaluated with an in-house ELISA assay (BioGeM scarl Medical Investigational Research, MIR-Ariano Irpino, Italy), along with antiheart and antimyosin abs, in the FDCM patients and compared with control healthy individuals. The correlation between levels of circulating anti-GB3 autoantibody myocardial inflammation and FDCM severity was assessed. Anti-Gb3 antibodies were above the positivity cut-off in 87.5% of FDCM subjects with myocarditis (42 out of 48), while 81.1% of FDCM patients without myocarditis were identified as negative for Gb3 antibodies. Positive anti-Gb3 abs correlated with positive antiheart and antimyosin abs.

To determine the specificity and utility of glycosphingolipidoses biomarkers against other LSDs, we applied a multiplexed lipid liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay to a DBS cohort of healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 10) and Gaucher (<i>n</i> = 4), Fabry (<i>n</i> = 10), Pompe (<i>n</i> = 2), mucopolysaccharidosis types I-VI (<i>n</i> = 52), and Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) (<i>n</i> = 5) patients. We observed no complete disease specificity for any of the markers tested. However, comparison among the different LSDs highlighted new applications and perspectives of the existing biomarkers. We observed elevations in glucosylceramide isoforms in the NPC and Gaucher patients relative to the controls. In NPC, there was a greater proportion of C24 isoforms, giving a specificity of 96-97% for NPC, higher than 92% for the NPC biomarker N-palmitoyl-O-phosphocholineserine ratio to lyso-sphingomyelin. We also observed significantly elevated levels of lyso-dihexosylceramide in Gaucher and Fabry disease as well as elevated lyso-globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-Gb3) in Gaucher disease and the neuronopathic forms of Mucopolysaccharidoses. In conclusion, DBS glucosylceramide isoform profiling has increased the specificity for the detection of NPC, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. Low levels of lyso-lipids can be observed in other LSDs, which may have implications in their disease pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked progressive lysosomal disorder, due to α-galactosidase A deficiency. Patients with a classic phenotype usually present in childhood as a multisystemic disease. Patients presenting with the later onset subtypes have cardiac, renal and neurological involvements in adulthood. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is often delayed until the organ damage is already irreversibly severe, making specific treatments less efficacious. For this reason, in the last two decades, newborn screening has been implemented to allow early diagnosis and treatment. This became possible with the application of the standard enzymology fluorometric method to dried blood spots. Then, high-throughput multiplexable assays, such as digital microfluidics and tandem mass spectrometry, were developed. Recently DNA-based methods have been applied to newborn screening in some countries. Using these methods, several newborn screening pilot studies and programs have been implemented worldwide. However, several concerns persist, and newborn screening for Fabry disease is still not universally accepted. In particular, enzyme-based methods miss a relevant number of affected females. Moreover, ethical issues are due to the large number of infants with later onset forms or variants of uncertain significance. Long term follow-up of individuals detected by newborn screening will improve our knowledge about the natural history of the disease, the phenotype prediction and the patients' management, allowing a better evaluation of risks and benefits of the newborn screening for Fabry disease."

Factors associated with MRI lesions, including sex, clinical subtype, disease severity, disease burden, genotype, and biomarkers, were also analyzed. Of 71 patients, 16 (22.5%) experienced ischemic stroke. The incidences of lacunar infarctions, white matter hyperintensities, and cerebral microbleeds were 55%, 62%, and 33%, respectively.

While AFD is recognized as a progressive multi-system disorder, infiltrative cardiomyopathy causing a number of cardiovascular manifestations is recognized as an important complication of this disease. AFD affects both men and women, although the clinical presentation typically varies by sex, with men presenting at a younger age with more neurologic and renal phenotype and women developing a later onset variant with more cardiovascular manifestations. AFD is an important cause of increased myocardial wall thickness, and advances in imaging, in particular cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and T1 mapping techniques, have improved the ability to identify this disease non-invasively. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of low alpha-galactosidase activity and identification of a mutation in the GLA gene. Enzyme replacement therapy remains the mainstay of disease modifying therapy, with two formulations currently approved. In addition, newer treatments such as oral chaperone therapy are now available for select patients, with a number of other investigational therapies in development. The availability of these therapies has significantly improved outcomes for AFD patients. Improved survival and the availability of multiple agents has presented new clinical dilemmas regarding disease monitoring and surveillance using clinical, imaging and laboratory biomarkers, in addition to improved approaches to managing cardiovascular risk factors and AFD complications. This review will provide an update on clinical recognition and diagnostic approaches including differentiation from other causes of increased ventricular wall thickness, in addition to modern strategies for management and follow-up."

We report a rare familial case of inherited cardiac FD associated with a novel double mutation in the <i>GLA</i> gene: W24R and N419D. A young man with severe obesity was admitted for heart failure (HF) with the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. Left ventricular hypertrophy was suspected during HF treatment after discharge, and in association with his mother's family history of cardiac diseases and sudden death, the etiology of the hypertrophy was re-examined. Very low α-Gal A activity confirmed the diagnosis of FD. Gene mutation analysis of <i>GLA</i> demonstrated a double mutation: W24R and N419D. Proband analysis revealed the same double mutation in his mother. Although she had no signs or symptoms of FD, we detected mild accumulation of globotriaosylsphingosine. The good laboratory practice-validated assay using HEK293 cells showed that the double mutation was amenable to migalastat, a pharmacological chaperone stabilizing α-Gal A.

    "abstract": "We describe the case of a 44-year-old male patient with a longstanding history of microhematuria and mildly impaired kidney function (CKD G2A1). The family history disclosed three females who also had microhematuria. Genetic testing by whole exome sequencing revealed two novel variants in <i>COL4A4</i> (NM_000092.5: c.1181G>T, NP_000083.3: p.Gly394Val, heterozygous, likely pathogenic; Alport syndrome, OMIM# 141200, 203780) and <i>GLA</i> (NM_000169.3: c.460A>G, NP_000160.1: p.Ile154Val, hemizygous, variant of uncertain significance; Fabry disease, OMIM# 301500), respectively. Extensive phenotyping revealed no biochemical or clinical evidence for the presence of Fabry disease. Thus, the <i>GLA</i> c.460A>G, p.Ile154Val, is to be classified as a benign variant, whereas the <i>COL4A4</i> c.1181G>T, p.Gly394Val confirms the diagnosis of autosomal dominant Alport syndrome in this patient."

    "abstract": "Variants in the galactosidase alpha (<i>GLA</i>) gene cause Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) deficiency. Recently, disease-modifying therapies have been developed, and simple diagnostic biomarkers for FD are required to initiate these therapies in the early stages of the disease. Detection of urinary mulberry bodies and cells (MBs/MCs) is beneficial for diagnosing FD. However, few studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of urinary MBs/MCs in FD. Herein, we retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic ability of urinary MBs/MCs for FD. We analyzed the medical records of 189 consecutive patients (125 males and 64 females) who underwent MBs/MCs testing. Out of these, two female patients had already been diagnosed with FD at the time of testing, and the remaining 187 patients were suspected of having FD and underwent both <i>GLA</i> gene sequencing and/or α-GalA enzymatic testing. Genetic testing did not confirm the diagnosis in 50 females (26.5%); hence, they were excluded from the evaluation. Two patients were previously diagnosed with FD, and sixteen were newly diagnosed. Among these 18 patients, 15, including two who had already developed HCM at diagnosis, remained undiagnosed until targeted genetic screening of at-risk family members of patients with FD was performed. The accuracy of urinary MBs/MCs testing exhibited a sensitivity of 0.944, specificity of 1, positive predictive value of 1, and negative predictive value of 0.992. MBs/MCs testing is highly accurate in diagnosing FD and should be considered during the initial evaluation prior to genetic testing, particularly in female patients."

We assessed the echocardiographic 3D left ventricular (LV) strain of patients with FD in relation to heart failure severity using natriuretic peptides, the presence of a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement scar, and long-term prognosis. 3D echocardiography was feasible in 75/99 patients with FD [aged 47 ± 14 years, 44% males, LV ejection fraction (EF) 65 ± 6% and 51% with hypertrophy or concentric remodelling of the LV]. Long-term prognosis (death, heart failure decompensation, or cardiovascular hospitalization) was assessed over a median follow-up of 3.1 years. A stronger correlation was observed for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels with 3D LV global longitudinal strain (GLS, r = -0.49, P < 0.0001) than with 3D LV global circumferential strain (GCS, r = -0.38, P < 0.001) or 3D LVEF (r = -0.25, P = 0.036). Individuals with posterolateral scar on CMR had lower posterolateral 3D circumferential strain (CS; P = 0.009). 3D LV-GLS was associated with long-term prognosis [adjusted hazard ratio 0.85 (confidence interval 0.75-0.95), P = 0.004], while 3D LV-GCS and 3D LVEF were not (P = 0.284 and P = 0.324). 3D LV-GLS is associated with both heart failure severity measured by natriuretic peptide levels and long-term prognosis. Decreased posterolateral 3D CS reflects typical posterolateral scarring in FD. Where feasible, 3D-strain echocardiography can be used for a comprehensive mechanical assessment of the LV in patients with FD."

Affected individuals may be carriers of gene variants that are of uncertain significance (GVUS). We describe kidney pathology at the early stages of FD-related kidney disease to gain insights into its association with GVUS and sex. Single-center, case series. Thirty-five consecutively biopsied patients (aged 48.1±15.4 years, 22 females) from among 64 patients with genetically diagnosed FD. Biopsies were retrospectively screened using the International Study Group of Fabry Nephropathy Scoring System. Genetic mutation type, p.N215S and D313Y, sex, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma lyso-Gb3 (pLyso-Gb3) levels, and histological parameters, including Gb3 deposits were recorded. Genetic analyses showed mostly missense mutations, p.N215S variant in 15, and the \"benign polymorphism\" D313Y in 4 of the biopsied patients. Morphological lesions were similar for men and women except for interstitial fibrosis and arteriolar hyalinosis being more common in men. Early in their clinical course, patients with normal/mild albuminuria had podocyte, tubular, and peritubular capillary vacuoles/inclusions, and evidence of chronicity, i.e., glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy. These findings appeared to be associated with pLyso-Gb3, eGFR, and age. Retrospective design and inclusion of outpatients partially based on family pedigree. In early stages of kidney disease in the setting of FD, numerous histological abnormalities are present. These observations suggest that kidney biopsies early in FD may reveal activity of kidney involvement that may inform clinical management."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the α-galactosidase A enzyme, which results in the globotriaosylceramide accumulation in many organs, including the kidneys. Nephropathy is a major FD complication that can progress to end-stage renal disease if not treated early. Although enzyme replacement therapy and chaperone therapy are effective, other treatments such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers can also provide nephroprotective effects when renal damage is also established. Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have been approved as innovative drugs for treating chronic kidney disease. Thus, we plan a multicenter observational prospective cohort study to assess the effect of Dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, in FD patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-3. The objectives are to evaluate the effect of Dapagliflozin primarily on albuminuria and secondarily on kidney disease progression and clinical FD stability. Thirdly, any association between SGT2i and cardiac pathology, exercise capacity, kidney and inflammatory biomarkers, quality of life, and psychosocial factors will also be evaluated. The inclusion criteria are age ≥ 18; CKD stages 1-3; and albuminuria despite stable treatment with ERT/Migalastat and ACEi/ARB. The exclusion criteria are immunosuppressive therapy, type 1 diabetes, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and recurrent UTIs. Baseline, 12-month, and 24-month visits will be scheduled to collect demographic, clinical, biochemical, and urinary data. Additionally, an exercise capacity and psychosocial assessment will be performed. The study could provide new insights into using SGLT2 inhibitors for treating kidney manifestations in Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Patients with Fabry disease suffer from chronic debilitating pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy with minimal treatment options, but the cellular drivers of this pain are unknown. Here, we propose a novel mechanism by which altered signaling between Schwann cells and sensory neurons underlies the peripheral sensory nerve dysfunction we observe in a genetic rat model of Fabry disease. Using <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that Fabry rat sensory neurons exhibit pronounced hyperexcitability. Schwann cells likely contribute to this finding as application of mediators released from cultured Fabry Schwann cells induces spontaneous activity and hyperexcitability in naïve sensory neurons. We examined putative algogenic mediators using proteomic analysis and found that Fabry Schwann cells release elevated levels of the protein p11 (S100-A10) which induces sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Removal of p11 from Fabry Schwann cell media causes hyperpolarization of neuronal resting membrane potential, indicating that p11 contributes to the excessive neuronal excitability caused by Fabry Schwann cells. These findings demonstrate that rats with Fabry disease exhibit sensory neuron hyperexcitability caused in part by Schwann cell release of the protein p11."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal accumulation of the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide Gb3 is linked to the deficient activity of the α-galactosidase A in the Anderson-Fabry disease and an elevated level of deacylated Gb3 is a hallmark of this condition. Localization of Gb3 in the plasma membrane is critical for studying how the membrane organization and its dynamics are affected in this genetic disorder. Gb3 analogs containing a terminal 6-azido-functionalized galactose in its head group globotriose (αGal1, 4βGal1, and 4Glc) are attractive chemical reporters for bioimaging, as the azido-group may act as a chemical tag for bio-orthogonal click chemistry. We report here the production of azido-Gb3 analogs employing mutants of galactokinase, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and α-1,4-galactosyltransferase LgtC, which participate in the synthesis of the sugar motif globotriose. Variants of enzymes galactokinase/UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase generate UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-d-galactose, which is the galactosyl-donor used by LgtC for transferring the terminal galactose moiety to lactosyl-acceptors. Residues at the galactose-binding site of the 3 enzymes were modified to facilitate the accommodation of azido-functionalized substrates and variants outperforming the wild-type enzymes were characterized. Synthesis of 6-azido-6-deoxy-d-galactose-1-phosphate, UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-d-galactose, and azido-Gb3 analogs by variants GalK-E37S, GalU-D133V, and LgtC-Q187S, respectively, is 3-6-fold that of their wild-type counterparts. Coupled reactions with these variants permit the production of the pricy, unnatural galactosyl-donor UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-d-galactose with ~90% conversion yields, and products azido-globotriose and lyso-AzGb3 with substrate conversion of up to 70%. AzGb3 analogs could serve as precursors for the synthesis of other tagged glycosphingolipids of the globo-series."

However, GDF-15 has diverse and partially opposing functions depending on the state of the cells and the microenvironment. Increased GDF-15 levels have been linked to an increased risk of incident chronic kidney disease and a faster decline in kidney function in various renal disorders, including diabetic nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis, primary membranous nephropathy, kidney transplantation, Fabry disease and amyloidosis. The mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet fully understood.

The endocrinological, metabolic, immunological and HLA status of 12 patients were evaluated. A total of 11 patients (91.6 %) had immunologic and/or endocrinologic abnormalities. fT4, anti-TPO, and anti-TG levels were increased in 1, 2, and 2 patients, respectively. Three patients had elevated proinflammatory cytokines. ANA profile, p-ANCA and c-ANCA were positive in 1, 1, and 2 patients, respectively. Tissue transglutaminase antibody was negative in all patients however P5 was diagnosed with Celiac disease at the age of 12 and on gluten free diet. All patients had distinct types of HLA apart from 2 patients with anti-TG and anti-TPO positive and there was no relationship between the HLA types and the autoimmunity biomarkers. FD may have impact on endocrinologic and immunologic abnormalities even in the patients under ERT, therefore prevalence of these abnormalities may be higher in ERT naïve patients. However, apparently, they are less likely to cause clinical symptoms. Certain HLA alleles may contribute to the direct impact of immunological pathogenesis in FD by developing abnormal autoimmune biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating HLA status of FD patients; therefore further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action."

Approximately 50 variants have been reported that cause splicing abnormalities in GLA. Most were found within canonical splice sites, which are highly conserved GT and AG splice acceptor and donor dinucleotides, whereas one-third were located outside canonical splice sites, making it difficult to interpret their pathogenicity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic pathogenicity of variants located in non-canonical splice sites within the GLA gene. 13 variants, including four deep intronic variants, were selected from the Human Gene Variant Database Professional. We performed an in vitro splicing assay to identify splicing abnormalities in the variants. All candidate non-canonical splice site variants in GLA caused aberrant splicing. Additionally, all but one variant was protein-truncating. The four deep intronic variants generated abnormal transcripts, including a cryptic exon, as well as normal transcripts, with the proportion of each differing in a cell-specific manner. Validation of splicing effects using an in vitro splicing assay is useful for confirming pathogenicity and determining associations with clinical phenotypes."

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the best medical therapy in the treatment of cervical artery dissection (CeAD) have demonstrated low rates of ischemia with both antiplatelet and vitamin K antagonism. RCT evidence supports the use of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonism in \"high-risk\" patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAS), and there is new evidence supporting the utilization of direct oral anticoagulation in malignancy-associated thrombosis. Migraine with aura has been more conclusively linked not only with increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, but also with cardiovascular mortality. Recent literature has surprisingly not provided support the utilization of L-arginine in the treatment of patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); however, there is evidence at this time that support use of enzyme replacement in patients with Fabry disease. Additional triggers for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) have been identified, such as capsaicin. Imaging of cerebral blood vessel walls utilizing contrast-enhanced MRA is an emerging modality that may ultimately prove to be very useful in the evaluation of patients with uncommon causes of stroke.

Treatment with migalastat, an oral pharmacological chaperone, was associated with a stabilization of cardiac biomarkers and a reduction in left ventricular mass index, as measured by echocardiography. A recent study, using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as the gold standard, found a stable course of myocardial involvement after 18 months of treatment with migalastat. Our study aimed to provide long-term CMR data for the treatment with migalastat. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 11 females and four males with pathogenic amenable <i>GLA</i> mutations were treated with migalastat and underwent 1.5T CMR imaging for routine treatment effect monitoring. The main outcome was a long-term myocardial structural change, reflected by CMR. <b>Results:</b> After migalastat treatment initiation, left ventricular mass index, end diastolic volume, interventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and plasma lyso-Gb3 remained stable during the median follow-up time of 34 months (min.: 25; max.: 47). The T1 relaxation times, reflecting glycosphingolipid accumulation and subsequent processes up to fibrosis, fluctuated over the time without a clear trend. No new onset of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) areas, reflecting local fibrosis or scar formation of the myocardium, could be detected. However, patients with initially present LGE showed an increase in LGE as a percentage of left ventricular mass. The median α-galactosidase A enzymatic activity increased from 37.3% (IQR 5.88-89.3) to 105% (IQR 37.2-177) of the lower limit of the respective reference level (<i>p</i> = 0.005). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study confirms an overall stable course of LVMi in patients with FD, treated with migalastat. However, individual patients may experience disease progression, especially those who present with fibrosis of the myocardium already at the time of therapy initiation. Thus, a regular treatment re-evaluation including CMR is needed to provide the optimal management for each patient."

Natural language processing (NLP) was used to evaluate patients' electronic health records (EHRs) to obtain detailed information about FD-specific patient characteristics. The NLP-determined elements, laboratory test results, and ICD-10 codes were transformed and grouped into pre-defined FD-specific clinical features that were scored in the context of their significance in the FD signs. The sum of clinical feature scores constituted the FD risk score. Then, medical records of patients with the highest FD risk score were reviewed by physicians who decided whether to refer a patient for additional tests or not. One patient who obtained a high-FD risk score was referred for DBS assay and confirmed to have FD. The presented NLP-based, decision-support scoring system achieved AUC of 0.998, which demonstrates that the applied approach enables for accurate identification of FD-suspected patients, with a high discrimination power."

CMR can accurately quantify the extent and distribution of hypertrophy, assess the presence and severity of myocardial fibrosis, and detect associated abnormalities. In the context of phenocopies, CMR can aid in the differentiation between HCM and other diseases that present with HCM-like features, such as cardiac amyloidosis (CA), Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), and mitochondrial cardiomyopathies.

We investigated the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and genomic associations of vitamin C renal leak in Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal disease associated with renal tubular dysfunction and low plasma vitamin C concentrations. We conducted a non-randomized cross-sectional cohort study of men aged 24-42 y, with Fabry disease (n = 34) and controls without acute or chronic disease (n = 33). To match anticipated plasma vitamin C concentrations, controls were placed on a low-vitamin C diet 3 wk before inpatient admission. To determine the primary outcome of vitamin C renal leak prevalence, subjects were fasted overnight, and matched urine and fasting plasma vitamin C measurements were obtained the following morning. Vitamin C renal leak was defined as presence of urinary vitamin C at plasma concentrations below 38 μM. Exploratory outcomes assessed the association between renal leak and clinical parameters, and genomic associations with renal leak using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin C transporter SLC23A1. Compared with controls, the Fabry cohort had 16-fold higher odds of renal leak (6% vs. 52%; OR: 16; 95% CI: 3.30, 162; P < 0.001). Renal leak was associated with higher protein creatinine ratio (P < 0.01) and lower hemoglobin (P = 0.002), but not estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.54).

Neutral theory, first described here, can be used to assess the accuracy of endpoints and improve their selection in rare disease clinical studies, reducing the risk of patient misclassification. Neutral theory was used to assess the accuracy of rare disease clinical study endpoints and the resulting probability of false positive and false negative classifications at different disease prevalence rates. Search strings were extracted from the Orphanet Register of Rare Diseases using a proprietary algorithm to conduct a systematic review of studies published until January 2021. Overall, 11 rare diseases with one disease-specific disease severity scale (133 studies) and 12 rare diseases with more than one disease-specific disease severity scale (483 studies) were included. All indicators from clinical studies were extracted, and Neutral theory was used to calculate their match to disease-specific disease severity scales, which were used as surrogates for the disease phenotype. For those with more than one disease-severity scale, endpoints were compared with the first disease-specific disease severity scale and a composite of all later scales. A Neutrality score of > 1.50 was considered acceptable. Around half the clinical studies for half the rare diseases with one disease-specific disease severity score (palmoplantar psoriasis, achalasia, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Fournier's gangrene) met the threshold for an acceptable match to the disease phenotype, one rare disease (Guillain-Barré syndrome) had one study with an acceptable match, and four diseases (Behcet's syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome) had no studies. Clinical study endpoints in almost half the rare diseases with more than one disease-specific DSS (acromegaly, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, Fabry disease and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) were a better match to the composite, while endpoints in the remaining rare diseases (Charcot Marie Tooth disease, Gaucher disease Type I, Huntington's disease, Sjogren's syndrome and Tourette syndrome) were a worse match. Misclassifications varied with increasing disease prevalence. Neutral theory confirmed that disease-severity measurement needs improvement in rare disease clinical studies, especially for some diseases, and suggested that the potential for accuracy increases as the body of knowledge on a disease increases. Using Neutral theory to benchmark disease-severity measurement in rare disease clinical studies may reduce the risk of misclassification, ensuring that recruitment and treatment effect assessment optimise medicine adoption and benefit patients."

    "title": "Cerebrovascular Phenotype in Fabry Disease Patients Assessed by Ultrasound.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with variable phenotypes, including neurological symptoms. These can be influenced by vascular impairment. Extracranial and transcranial vascular sonography is an effective and noninvasive method for measuring arterial structures and blood flow. The study aims to investigate cerebrovascular phenotype characteristics in FD patients compared to controls using neurosonology. This is a single-center, cross-sectional study of 130 subjects-65 patients (38 females), with genetically confirmed FD, and 65 sex- and age-matched controls. Using ultrasonography, we measured structural and hemodynamic parameters, including distal common carotid artery intima-media thickness, inner vertebral artery diameter, resting blood flow velocity, pulsatility index, and cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) in the middle cerebral artery. To assess differences between FD and controls and to identify factors influencing investigated outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses were performed. In comparison to sex- and age-matched controls, FD patients displayed significantly increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (observed FD 0.69 ± 0.13 mm versus controls 0.63 ± 0.12 mm; P<sub>adj</sub> = .0014), vertebral artery diameter (observed FD 3.59 ± 0.35 mm versus controls 3.38 ± 0.33 mm; P<sub>adj</sub> = .0002), middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (observed FD 0.98 ± 0.19 versus controls 0.87 ± 0.11; P<sub>adj</sub> < .0001), and significantly decreased CVR (observed FD 1.21 ± 0.49 versus controls 1.35 ± 0.38; P<sub>adj</sub> = .0409), when adjusted by age, BMI, and sex. Additionally, FD patients had significantly more variable CVR (0.48 ± 0.25 versus 0.21 ± 0.14; P<sub>adj</sub> < .0001). Our results suggest the presence of multiple vascular abnormalities and changes in hemodynamic parameters of cerebral arteries in patients with FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in various tissues and body fluids, leading to progressive organ damage and life-threatening complications. Phenotypic classification is based on disease progression and severity and can be used to predict outcomes. Patients with a classic Fabry phenotype have little to no residual α-Gal A activity and have widespread organ involvement, whereas patients with a later-onset phenotype have residual α-Gal A activity and disease progression can be limited to a single organ, often the heart. Diagnosis and monitoring of patients with Fabry disease should therefore be individualized, and biomarkers are available to support with this. Disease-specific biomarkers are useful in the diagnosis of Fabry disease; non-disease-specific biomarkers may be useful to assess organ damage. For most biomarkers it can be challenging to prove they translate to differences in the risk of clinical events associated with Fabry disease. Therefore, careful monitoring of treatment outcomes and collection of prospective data in patients are needed. As we deepen our understanding of Fabry disease, it is important to regularly re-evaluate and appraise published evidence relating to biomarkers. In this article, we present the results of a literature review of evidence published between February 2017 and July 2020 on the impact of disease-specific treatment on biomarkers and provide an expert consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of those biomarkers."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. Renal involvement in FD is characterized by proteinuria and progressive renal decline. Reports on FD with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as the initial manifestation are rare. In this paper, we report a pediatric case with an N215S variant. A boy with an onset of polydipsia and polyuria at approximately 4 years of age was diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Whole-exome sequencing showed a GLA N215S variation with no secondary cause of diabetes insipidus. No family history of polydipsia or polyuria was reported; however, the patient's maternal grandmother and her two younger brothers had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Both brothers required surgery due to severe cardiac involvement, and the youngest brother died of heart disease at the age of 50 years. The patient's polydipsia and polyuria worsened over the next 7 years. Serum sodium was normal, but the patient required high-dose potassium chloride to maintain normal serum potassium levels. His physical and intellectual development was normal, with no common complications of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, such as anemia, malnutrition, vomiting, high fever, or convulsions. Dried blood spot testing showed α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) activity of 0.6 μmol/L/h and a Lyso-GL-3 level of 7.01 ng/ml. The patient developed mild proteinuria and mild myocardial hypertrophy. Renal biopsy showed myeloid bodies and zebra bodies. After more than 1 year of ERT, his urine specific gravity increased to 1.005-1.008, which was a new sign reflecting the efficacy of ERT, although urine output was maintained at 3-5 ml/kg/hour. We will continue to monitor the patient's renal tubular function and urine output. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may be the initial manifestation in children with FD and/or N215S variation. In FD, the same mutation in a family may present a completely different phenotype."

A 53-year-old man with chronic kidney disease due to AFD and a medical history of revascularized coronary artery disease, chronic atrial fibrillation, and arterial hypertension was referred to our unit for evaluation of possible cardiac involvement in the context of AFD. Biochemical evaluation reported reduced serum alpha-galactosidase A activity and borderline abnormal serum lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> enzyme activity. The patient had also history of acroparesthesias, dermatological presentation of multiple angiokeratomas, severe kidney impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73m² by the age of 16, and microalbuminuria that cumulatively set the diagnosis of AFD. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed left ventricular concentric hypertrophy with left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. Cardiac magnetic resonance showed findings in keeping with ischaemic heart disease (IHD), i.e. akinesia and subendocardial scarring of the basal anterior and the entirety of the septum and the true apex; in addition, there was severe asymmetrical hypertrophy of the basal anteroseptum (max 18 mm), evidence of low-grade myocardial inflammation, and mid-wall fibrosis of the basal inferior and inferolateral wall, suggesting a cardiomyopathic process-myocardial disease which could not be explained solely by IHD or well-controlled hypertension. This is the first case of possible cardiac involvement in a patient with AFD due to the D313Y variant. This case demonstrates the diagnostic challenges of cardiac involvement in AFD, especially in the presence of a concomitant underlying pathology."

In the present case, ERT with agalsidase alfa for 4 years decreased QRS voltage and negative T depth along with a reduction of left ventricular mass and wall thickness and improvement of symptoms in a female patient with Fabry disease.

    "title": "From the phenotype to precision medicine: an update on the cardiomyopathies diagnostic workflow.",
    "abstract": "Cardiomyopathies are disease of the cardiac muscle largely due to genetic alterations of proteins with 'structural' or 'functional' roles within the cardiomyocyte, going from the regulation of contraction-relaxation, metabolic and energetic processes to ionic fluxes. Modifications occurring to these proteins are responsible, in the vast majority of cases, for the phenotypic manifestations of the disease, including hypertrophic, dilated, arrhythmogenic and restrictive cardiomyopathies. Secondary nonhereditary causes to be excluded include infections, toxicity from drugs or alcohol or medications, hormonal imbalance and so on. Obtaining a phenotypic definition and an etiological diagnosis is becoming increasingly relevant and feasible, thanks to the availability of new tailored treatments and the diagnostic advancements made particularly in the field of genetics. This is, for example, the case for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, Fabry disease or dilated cardiomyopathies due to laminopathies. For these diseases, specific medications have been developed, and a more tailored arrhythmic risk stratification guides the implantation of a defibrillator. In addition, new medications directly targeting the altered protein responsible for the phenotype are becoming available (including the myosin inhibitors mavacantem and aficamten, monoclonal antibodies against Ras-MAPK, genetic therapies for sarcoglycanopathies), thus making a precision medicine approach less unrealistic even in the field of cardiomyopathies. For these reasons, a contemporary approach to cardiomyopathies must consider diagnostic algorithms founded on the clinical suspicion of the disease and developed towards a more precise phenotypic definition and etiological diagnosis, based on a multidisciplinary methodology putting together specialists from different disciplines, facilities for advanced imaging testing and genetic and anatomopathological competencies."

With the rapid evolution of genome editing technology, genetic modification could be applied to enhance the therapeutic effects of iPSCs, such as the introduction of secreted molecules to make the cells a drug delivery system. Here, we addressed this possibility by utilizing a Fabry disease mouse model, as a proof of concept. Fabry disease is caused by the lack of α-galactosidase A (GLA). We previously developed an immunotolerant therapeutic molecule, modified α-<i>N</i>-acetylgalactosaminidase (mNAGA). We confirmed that secreted mNAGA from genome-edited iPSCs compensated for the GLA activity in GLA-deficient cells using an <i>in vitro</i> co-culture system. Moreover, iPSCs transplanted into Fabry model mice secreted mNAGA and supplied GLA activity to the liver. This study demonstrates the great potential of genome-edited iPSCs secreting therapeutic molecules."

    "abstract": "In Fabry disease (FD), primary factors such as glycosphingolipid deposition that initiate kidney damage and secondary factors that advance kidney damage to fibrosis are different. Periostin is a molecule of proven importance in renal inflammation and fibrosis. It was previously shown that periostin plays an essential role in the process leading to renal fibrosis and its expression is increased in many kidney diseases. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the relationship between periostin and Fabry nephropathy. This cross-sectional study included 18 FD patients (10 males, 8 females) with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) indications and 22 healthy control patients of similar age and gender. At the time of diagnosis, plasma alpha-galactosidase A (α-gal-A) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), proteinuria, and kidney function tests of all FD patients before ERT were scanned from the hospital system. Periostin was studied from serum samples collected and stored before ERT. Parameters related to serum periostin levels in Fabry disease were investigated. In FD patients, serum periostin was negatively correlated with age of first symptom and GFR; and positively correlated with proteinuria and lyso-Gb3. In regression analysis, we found that serum periostin was the only independent determinant of proteinuria in patients with Fabry disease. The serum periostin levels were significantly lower in patients with low proteinuria, and the serum periostin levels were correlated with proteinuria. Periostin may be a valuable marker of Fabry nephropathy and proteinuria. Periostin seems to be one of the molecules that may have an important role in the management of the fibrotic process in Fabry nephropathy. We think that the role of periostin among these mechanisms is worth investigating. In addition to standard ERTs, periostin-reducing therapies may contribute to better kidney survival in Fabry disease. Progressive fibrosis processes caused by periostin in patients with Fabry disease are still a hidden issue waiting to be clarified.

    "abstract": "In this study, we revealed a peculiar morphological feature of 50B11 nociceptive sensory neurons in in vitro culture related to the forskolin-induced differentiation of these cells growing upside-down on cover glass supports. Multi-photon non-linear microscopy was applied to monitor increased neurite arborization and elongation. Under live and unstained conditions, second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy could monitor microtubule organization inside the cells while also correlating with the detection of cellular multi-photon autofluorescence, probably derived from mitochondria metabolites. Although the differentiated cells of each compartment did not differ significantly in tubulin or multi-photon autofluorescence contents, the upturned neurons were more elongated, presenting a higher length/width cellular ratio and longer neurites, indicative of differentiated cells. SHG originating from the axons' microtubules represented a proper tool to study neurons' inverted culture in live conditions without exogenous staining. This work represents the first instance of examining neuronal cell lines growing and differentiated in an upside-down orientation, allowing a possible improvement of 50B11 as a model in physiology studies of sensory neurons in peripheric nervous system disease (e.g., Fabry disease, Friedreich ataxia, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, porphyria, type 1 diabetes, Guillain-Barré syndrome in children) and analgesic drug screening."

    "abstract": "Pain in Fabry disease (FD) is generally accepted to result from neuronal damage in the peripheral nervous system as a consequence of excess lipid storage caused by alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) deficiency. Signatures of pain arising from nerve injuries are generally associated with changes of number, location and phenotypes of immune cells within dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, the neuroimmune processes in the DRG linked to accumulating glycosphingolipids in Fabry disease are insufficiently understood.Therefore, using indirect immune fluorescence microscopy, transmigration assays and FACS together with transcriptomic signatures associated with immune processes, we assessed age-dependent neuroimmune alterations in DRG obtained from mice with a global depletion of α-Gal A as a valid mouse model for FD. Macrophage numbers in the DRG of FD mice were unaltered, and BV-2 cells as a model for monocytic cells did not show augmented migratory reactions to glycosphingolipids exposure suggesting that these do not act as chemoattractants in FD. However, we found pronounced alterations of lysosomal signatures in sensory neurons and of macrophage morphology and phenotypes in FD DRG. Macrophages exhibited reduced morphological complexity indicated by a smaller number of ramifications and more rounded shape, which were age dependent and indicative of premature monocytic aging together with upregulated expression of markers CD68 and CD163.In our FD mouse model, the observed phenotypic changes in myeloid cell populations of the DRG suggest enhanced phagocytic and unaltered proliferative capacity of macrophages as compared to wildtype control mice. We suggest that macrophages may participate in FD pathogenesis and targeting macrophages at an early stage of FD may offer new treatment options other than enzyme replacement therapy."

At a low magnification of 100 ×, the entire specimen, including the glomerulus, was obtained. LVSEM at 5000 × magnification was sufficient to identify paramesangial deposits in IgA nephropathy and subepithelial electron-dense deposits (EDD) and spikes in membranous nephropathy. Glomerular basement membrane thickening in DM and thinning in TBMD could be sufficiently diagnosed with LVSEM at 6000 ×. Accumulation of ceramide in Fabry's disease was easily identified, but amyloid fibril could not be identified by LVSEM.

Prevalence of increased PI (>1.2) and decreased BHI (<0.69) and ultrasound indices of cerebral autoregulation were compared in FD patients and controls.

However, the production of its deacylated form globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) is also observed and its plasma levels have closer association with disease severity. Studies have shown that lyso-Gb3 directly affects podocytes and causes sensitisation of peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, little is understood of the mechanisms of this cytotoxicity. To study the effect on neuronal cells, we incubated SH-Sy5y cells with lyso-Gb3 at low (20 ng/mL) and high (200 ng/mL) levels, to mimic mild and classical FD serum levels. We used glucosylsphingosine as a positive control to determine specific effects of lyso-Gb3. Proteomic analyses revealed that cellular systems affected by lyso-Gb3 included cell signalling particularly protein ubiquitination and protein translation. To confirm ER/proteasome perturbations, we performed an immune enrichment of ubiquitinated proteins and demonstrated specific increased protein ubiquitination at both doses. The most ubiquitinated proteins observed included the chaperone/heat shock proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and synthesis/translation proteins. To detect proteins that interact directly with lyso-Gb3, we immobilised lyso-lipids, then incubated them with neuronal cellular extracts and identified bound proteins using mass spectrometry. Proteins that specifically bound were chaperones and included HSP90, HSP60 and the TRiC complex. In conclusion, lyso-Gb3 exposure affects pathways involved in protein translation and folding. This response is observed as increased ubiquitination and changes in signalling proteins which may explain the multiple biological processes, particularly cellular remodelling, often associated with FD."

    "abstract": "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is the most relevant tool of cardiac magnetic resonance for tissue characterization, and it plays a pivotal role for diagnostic and prognostic assessment of cardiomyopathies. The pattern of presentation of LGE allows differential diagnosis between ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart disease with high diagnostic accuracy, and among different cardiomyopathies, specific presentation of LGE may help to make a diagnosis. Late gadolinium enhancement may be caused by conditions that significantly increase the interstitial space or, less frequently, that slow down Gd exit, like myocardial fibrosis. In chronic myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy, Fabry disease, and other conditions, LGE is a marker of myocardial fibrosis, but also in patients with acute myocarditis where LGE may be also explained by the increase of interstitial space caused by interstitial oedema or by tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells. In cardiac amyloidosis, LGE represents myocardial fibrosis but the interstitial overload of amyloid proteins should also be considered as a potential cause of LGE. The identification of the pattern of presentation of LGE is also very important. In the ischaemic pattern, LGE always involves the subendocardial layer with more or less transmural extent, it is confluent, and every single scar should be located in the territory of one coronary artery. In the non-ischaemic pattern, LGE does not fulfil the previous criteria, being midwall, subepicardial, or mixed, not necessarily confluent or confined to a territory of one coronary artery. For cardiomyopathies, the exact pattern of non-ischaemic LGE is important. Quantitative analysis of LGE is required in some specific conditions as in HCM. Magnetic resonance imaging with LGE technique should be performed in every patient with suspect of cardiomyopathy. The lack of standardization of pulse sequence and mostly of quantification methods is the main limitation of LGE technique."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient a-galactosidase A activity that leads to an accumulation of glycolipids, mainly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine, in affected tissues, including the heart. Cardiovascular involvement usually manifests as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, heart failure, and arrhythmias, which limit the quality of life and represent the most common causes of death. Following the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy, early diagnosis and treatment have become essential in slowing down the disease progression and preventing major cardiac complications. Recent advances in the understanding of FD pathophysiology suggest that in addition to Gb3 accumulation, other mechanisms contribute to the development of cardiac damage. FD cardiomyopathy is characterized by an earlier stage of glycosphingolipid accumulation and a later one of hypertrophy. Morphological and functional aspects are not specific in the echocardiographic evaluation of Anderson-Fabry disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance with tissue characterization capability is an accurate technique for the differential diagnosis of LVH. Progress in imaging techniques has improved the diagnosis and staging of FD-related cardiac disease: a decreased myocardial T1 value is specific of FD. Late gadolinium enhancement is typical of the later stage of cardiac involvement but as in other cardiomyopathy is also valuable to predict the outcome and cardiac response to therapy."

    "abstract": "The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) represents a cornerstone for the diagnosis and evaluation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common genetically determined heart muscle disease, due to its cost-effectiveness and wide availability. The ECG may surprisingly look normal in 4-6% of adult patients, and in less than 3% of paediatric patients, but it is abnormal in the vast majority of the remaining patients. 'Specific' features comprise pathological Q-waves, deep S-waves in V1-V3, or high R-waves in V4-V6 due to left ventricular hypertrophy with T-wave (TW) depression or negative TWs. Negative giant TWs are often found in apical HCM. However, in many patients, the ECG may only show non-specific ST-T changes with diphasic or flat TWs. An isolated inverted TW in lateral leads (usually aVL) may be the only marker for HCM in some patients. Electrocardiogram helps to diagnose sarcomeric HCM and distinguish it from different phenocopies, such as cardiac amyloidosis, glycogen storage, or Fabry disease. Electrocardiogram may also have a prognostic role, identifying high-risk features that could impact the clinical outcome."

All these conditions share a wide phenotypic variability which results from the combination of genetic and environmental factors and whose pathogenic mediators are poorly understood so far. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays a critical role in a broad spectrum of cardiovascular conditions, including cardiomyopathies. Indeed, inflammation can trigger molecular pathways which contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction, extracellular matrix accumulation, and microvascular dysfunction. Growing evidence suggests that systemic inflammation is a possible key pathophysiologic process potentially involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac disease progression, influencing the severity of the phenotype and clinical outcome, including heart failure.

Carriers of GLA p.Phe113Leu variant underwent subsequent multidisciplinary clinical and instrumental evaluation. Thirty-one (16 M, 15 F) individuals with p.Phe113Leu pathogenic variant were identified. Sixteen out of 31 patients (51.6%) had cardiac manifestations. Notably, myocardial fibrosis was found in 7/8 patients, of whom 2 were under 40 years. Stroke occurred in 4 patients. White matter lesions were detected in 12/19 patients and occurred in 2/10 of subjects under 40 years. Seven females complained of acroparesthesias. Renal involvement occurred in 10 patients. Angiokeratomas were evident in 9 subjects. Eyes, ear, gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement occurred in the minority of subjects. This study demonstrates that a cluster of subjects with p.Phe113Leu pathogenic variant is also present in Southern Italy. Disease manifestations are frequent in both sexes and may occur early in life. Cardiac involvement represents the core manifestation, but neurological and renal involvement is also frequent, suggesting that extra-cardiac complications deserve clinical attention."

    "title": "Development of a Biosimilar of Agalsidase Beta for the Treatment of Fabry Disease: Preclinical Evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme α-galactosidase A (aGal A). Since 2001, two different enzyme replacement therapies have been authorized, with agalsidase beta being used in most parts of the Western world. Currently, biosimilars of several expensive enzyme therapies are under development to improve their accessibility for patients. We present the preclinical results of the development of a biosimilar to agalsidase beta. Produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-cell system, the biosimilar aGal A Biosidus (AGABIO), was compared with agalsidase beta with respect to amino acid sequence, glycosylation, specific α-galactosidase activity, stability in plasma, and effects on cultured human Fabry fibroblasts and Fabry mice. AGABIO had the same amino acid composition and similar glycosylation, enzymatic activity, and stability as compared with agalsidase beta. After uptake in fibroblasts, α-galactosidase A activity increased in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum uptake observed after 24 h, which remained stable until at least 48 h. Both enzymes were localized to lysosomes. Reduction of accumulated globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and lysoGb3 in cultured Fabry fibroblasts by AGABIO and agalsidase beta showed comparable dose-response curves. In Fabry knockout mice, after a single injection, both enzymes were rapidly cleared from the plasma and showed equal reductions in tissue and plasma sphingolipids. Repeated dose studies in rats did not raise any safety concerns. Anti-drug antibodies from patients with FD treated with agalsidase beta showed equal neutralization activity toward AGABIO. These findings support the biosimilarity of AGABIO in comparison with agalsidase beta. The clinical study phase is currently under development."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X chromosome-linked, life-threatening lysosomal disease caused by one of more than 1000 currently known variants in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene. The follow-up part of the Fabry Disease in Ostrobothnia (FAST) study reports the long-term effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on a prospectively collected cohort of 12 patients, 4 males and 8 females, mean age 46 years (SD 16), with the classical variant c.679C > T p.Arg227Ter, which is one of the most common FD variants worldwide. In the natural history period of the FAST study, half of the patients in both sexes had at least one major event, of which 80% were of cardiac origin. During 5 years of ERT, four patients had a total of six major clinical events consisting of one silent ischemic stroke, three ventricular tachycardias and two increased left ventricular mass indexes. In addition, four patients developed minor cardiac events, four patients minor renal events, and one patient a minor neurological event. ERTs may delay but not prevent the progression of the disease in most patients with the variant Arg227Ter. This variant might be suitable for investigating the efficacy of second-generation ERTs compared to the currently used ERTs regardless of sex."

    "title": "Lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine induces endothelial dysfunction <i>via</i> autophagy-dependent regulation of necroptosis.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the lysosomal accumulations of glycosphingolipids in a variety of cytotypes, which include endothelial cells. The disease is inherited and originates from an error in glycosphingolipid catabolism caused by insufficient α-galactosidase A activity, which causes uncontrolled progressive storage of intracellular globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in the vasculature and extracellular accumulation of lyso-Gb3 (a deacetylated soluble form of Gb3). Necrosis can lead to inflammation, which exacerbates necrosis and creates a positive feedback loop that triggers necroinflammation. However, the role played by necroptosis, a form of programmed necrotic cell death, in the cell-to-cell inflammatory reaction between epithelial and endothelial cells is unclear. Thus, the present study was undertaken to determine whether lyso-Gb3 induces necroptosis and whether necroptosis inhibition protects endothelial dysfunction against lyso-Gb3 inflamed retinal pigment epithelial cells. We found lyso-Gb3 induced necroptosis of a retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) in an autophagy-dependent manner and that conditioned media (CM) from ARPE-19 cells treated with lyso-Gb3 induced the necroptosis, inflammation, and senescence of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, a pharmacological study showed CM from lyso-Gb3 treated ARPE-19 cells induced endothelial necroptosis, inflammation, and senescence were significantly inhibited by an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) and by two necroptosis inhibitors (necrostatin and GSK-872), respectively. These results demonstrate lyso-Gb3 induces necroptosis via autophagy and suggest that lyso-Gb3 inflamed retinal pigment epithelial cells trigger endothelial dysfunction via the autophagy-dependent necroptosis pathway. This study suggests the involvement of a novel autophagy-dependent necroptosis pathway in the regulation of endothelial dysfunction in Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry's disease (FD) is a genetic disorder of lysosomal storage characterized by the intralysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). This genetic mutation causes a total or partial deficit of the α-galactosidase (GAL) enzyme activity. FD has an incidence of 1:40000-60000 born alive. Its prevalence is higher in specific pathological conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the FD prevalence in Italian renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients from Lazio region. 485 patients in RRT (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation) were recruited. The screening test was performed on venous blood sample. The latter was analyzed using specific FD diagnostic kit, based on the analysis of dried blood spots on filter paper. We found 3 cases of positivity to FD (1 female and 2 males). In addition, 1 male patient was identified with biochemical alteration indicative of GAL enzyme deficiency with a genetic variant of the GLA gene of unknown clinical significance. The FD prevalence in our population was 0.60% (1 case out 163), it rises to 0.80% (1 case out of 122) if the genetic variant of unknown clinical significance is considered. Comparing the three subpopulations, we observed a statistically significant difference in GAL activity in transplanted patients compared to dialysis patients (p<0.001). Considering the presence of an enzyme replacement therapy able to modify FD clinical history, it is essential to try to implement FD early diagnoses. However, the screening is too expensive to be extended on large scale, due to the low prevalence of the pathology. The screening should be performed on high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), metabolic disorders resulting in build-up of endogenous waste and progressive organ damage, can be treated with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT can be administered either in specialized clinics, at a physician's office or in the home care setting. Legislative goals in Germany strive to shift to more outpatient care while maintaining treatment objectives. This study investigates the patient perspective on home-based ERT in terms of acceptance, safety, and treatment satisfaction in LSD patients. This was a longitudinal observational study, carried out under real-world conditions in patients' home environment, covering 30 months from January 2019 to June 2021. Patients with LSDs who were deemed suitable for home-based ERT by their physicians were recruited to the study. Patients were interviewed before the start of the first home-based ERT and then at regular intervals thereafter using standardized questionnaires. Data from 30 patients were analyzed: 18 with Fabry disease, 5 with Gaucher disease, 6 with Pompe disease and 1 with Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). Age ranged from 8 to 77 years (mean age 40). The reported average waiting time prior to infusion of more than half an hour decreased from 30% of the patients affected at baseline to 5% across all follow-up time points. All patients felt adequately informed about home-based ERT throughout follow-ups and reported that they would choose home-based ERT again. At almost each time point, patients indicated that home-based ERT had improved their ability to cope with the disease. All but one patient indicated feeling safe at each follow-up time point. Compared to 36.7% at baseline, only 6.9% of patients reported a need for improvement in their care after 6 months of home-based ERT. Mean treatment satisfaction increased by approximately 1.6 scale points after 6 months of home-based ERT compared to baseline, and by another 0.2 scale points after 18 months. In terms of quality of care, all but one patient rated home-based ERT as an equivalent alternative throughout follow-ups. Patients would recommend home-based ERT to other suitable LSD-patients. Home-based ERT increases patients' treatment satisfaction, and patients perceive the quality of care as an equivalent alternative, compared to ERT in a center, clinic, or at a physician's office."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Health state utilities are measures of health-related quality of life that reflect the value placed on improvements in patients' health status and are necessary for estimation of quality-adjusted life-years. Health state utility data on Fabry disease (FD) are limited. In this study we used vignette (scenario) construction and valuation to develop health state utilities. <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this study was to use vignette construction and valuation to estimate health state utility values suitable for inclusion in economic models of FD treatments. <b>Methods:</b> Health state vignettes were developed from semistructured qualitative telephone interviews with patients with FD and informed by published literature and input from an expert. Each vignette was valued in an online survey by members of the United Kingdom (UK) general population using the composite time trade-off (TTO) method, which aims to determine the time the respondent would trade to live in full health compared with each impaired health state. <b>Results:</b> Eight adults (50% women) with FD from the UK were interviewed. They were recruited via various approaches, including patient organizations and social media. The interviewees' responses, evidence from published literature, and input from a clinical expert informed the development of 6 health state vignettes (pain, moderate clinically evident FD [CEFD], severe CEFD, end-stage renal disease [ESRD], stroke, and cardiovascular disease [CVD]) and 3 combined health states (severe CEFD + ESRD, severe CEFD + CVD, and severe CEFD + stroke). A vignette valuation survey was administered to 1222 participants from the UK general population who were members of an external surveying organization and agreed to participate in this study; 1175 surveys were successfully completed and included in the analysis. Responses to TTO questions were converted into utility values for each health state. Pain was the highest valued health state (0.465), and severe CEFD + ESRD was the lowest (0.033). <b>Discussion:</b> Overall, mean utility values declined as the severity of the vignettes increased, indicating that respondents were more willing to trade life-years to avoid a severe health state. <b>Conclusions:</b> Health state vignettes reflect the effects of FD on all major health-related quality-of-life domains and may help to support economic modeling for treatment of FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient α-galactosidase A activity. The spectrum of disease includes phenotypes ranging from \"classic\" to \"later-onset,\" with varying kidney disease progression. Identifying patterns of declining kidney function and involvement of other major organs in patients with FD is important to guide therapy decisions. Clusters of patients with FD and similar estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and age were created using agglomerative clustering of data captured between 2007 and 2020 in the United States Optum Market Clarity database. Male patients with a diagnosis of FD and two or more eGFR values ≥6 months apart were included. Disease progression was compared with a control cohort of patients without an FD diagnosis. eGFR values from 234 male patients with FD were analysed, yielding seven clusters. Five clusters demonstrated disease progression from \"natural\" eGFR decline, with a slight decrease in kidney function and eGFR usually within the normal range, to rapid, early decline in eGFR and cardiac complications. When compared with the control cohort, a more rapid decline and a higher percentage of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, arrhythmias and stroke were noted in the study group. An inflection point was observed in each cluster when deterioration of kidney function accelerated. Clustering of male patients with FD by decline in kidney function, organ involvement and phenotype through analysis of real-world data provides a reference that could help determine the optimal time for initiation of FD-specific treatment and facilitate management decisions made by healthcare professionals."

VD, VLD, foveal avascular zone (FAZ), and the VD/VLD were compared to an HC group using a linear mixed model; Results: A statistically significant difference in the VLD and VD/VLD of DCP was observed between the two groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Using ROC curves with AUC and Youden's Index, a cut-off value for differentiating both groups using VD/VLD in DCP FD with high specificity and high sensitivity was established; Conclusions: FD and HC groups seem to be separable using the VD/VLD ratio in DCP. This new biomarker might differentiate changes in the retinal microvasculature that are not detectable by VD or VLD alone."

    "abstract": "The assessment of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as diagnostic and prognostic maker in Fabry disease is advancing. We aimed to investigate the impact of clinical characteristics and CMR findings on cardiac outcome in patients with FD. In this study 55 patients with genetically confirmed FD and available CMR imaging were included. The primary endpoint was defined as a composite of cardiac events including cardiac death, new occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia requiring device insertion. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 3.7-5.9), 9 patients (16.3%) reached the primary cardiac end point. The global amount of LGE was associated with an increased risk for primary endpoint in the univariate analysis (HR 1.4 per 10% increase in LGE, p = 0.002). However maximal wall thickness (MWT) was the sole independent predictor of the primary endpoint in a stepwise logistic regression model (HR 9.8 per mm increase in MWT, p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant difference in event free survival rate between patients with and without LVH (Long-rank p = 0.006) and in patients with and without LGE (Long-rank p < 0.001). Patients without LVH and LGE were free of adverse cardiac events. LVH and LGE detected by CMR were associated with adverse cardiac events in FD. In particular maximal wall thickness can be useful in cardiac risk stratification of FD patients."

    "abstract": "Early initiation is essential for successful treatment of Fabry disease, but sensitive and noninvasive biomarkers of Fabry nephropathy are lacking. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) represent a promising source of biomarkers of kidney involvement. Among them, microRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that contribute to the development and progression of various kidney diseases. We aimed to identify uEV-derived miRNAs involved in the development and/or progression of Fabry nephropathy. Patients with genetically confirmed Fabry disease and matched control subjects were included. EVs were isolated from the second morning urine by size exclusion chromatography, from which miRNAs were extracted. miRNA urine exosome PCR panels were used to characterize the miRNA signature in a discovery cohort. Individual qPCRs were performed on a validation cohort that included chronological samples. We identified the target genes of dysregulated miRNAs and searched for potential hub genes. Enrichment analyses were performed to identify their potential function. The expression of miR-21-5p and miR-222-3p was significantly higher in patients with stable renal function and those with progressive nephropathy compared with the corresponding controls. In addition, the expression of miR-30a-5p, miR-10b-5p, and miR-204-5p was significantly lower in patients with progressive nephropathy, however, in the chronological samples, this was only confirmed for miR-204-5p. Some of the identified hub genes controlled by the dysregulated miRNAs have been associated with kidney impairment in other kidney diseases. The miRNA cargo in uEVs changes with the development and progression of Fabry nephropathy and, therefore, represents a potential biomarker that may provide a new option to prevent or attenuate the progression of nephropathy. Furthermore, dysregulated miRNAs were shown to be potentially associated with pathophysiological pathways in the kidney."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare hereditary disease involving multiple organs, and there are few reports on how the initial manifestations and renal involvement of these patients with classical and late-onset phenotype evolve with sexes and ages. To improve clinicians' understanding of Fabry disease and avoid misdiagnoses by discussing the initial manifestations, first medical specialties visited and renal involvement development in patients. This study collected relevant data from 311 Chinese Fabry disease patients (200 males, 111 females) and descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the evolution of the initial manifestations and renal involvement of patients with classical and late-onset phenotype at different sexes and ages. Regarding the age at manifestation onset, age at the first medical specialty visited and age at the diagnosis of Fabry disease, males were earlier than females, and males with classical phenotype were earlier than males with late-onset and females with classical phenotype. In both male and female patients, the initial manifestations of classical patients were mainly acroparesthesia, and the first medical specialty visited were mainly pediatrics and neurology. The initial manifestations of late-onset patients were mainly renal and cardiovascular involvement, and the first medical specialty visited were mainly nephrology and cardiology. In classical patients, both male and female, the initial manifestations of the preschool and the juvenile groups were mainly acroparesthesia, and the frequency of renal and cardiovascular involvement in the young group was higher than that in the preschool and juvenile groups. There was no obvious renal involvement in the preschool group, renal involvement was most common in the young group and the middle-aged and elderly group. Proteinuria can appear in classical male patients as early as approximately 20 years, and renal insufficiency can occur at approximately 25 years. With age, over 50% of classical male patients can develop varying degrees of proteinuria at the age of 25 and renal insufficiency at the age of 40. 15.94% of the patients progressed to dialysis or kidney transplantation, mainly classical males. The initial manifestation of Fabry disease is affected by sex, age and classical/late-onset phenotype. The initial manifestations were mainly acroparesthesia and the frequency and degree of renal involvement increased gradually with aging in classical male patients."

    "abstract": "Current therapies for Fabry disease are based on reversing intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or chaperone-mediated stabilization of the defective enzyme, thereby alleviating lysosomal dysfunction. However, their effect in the reversal of end-organ damage, like kidney injury and chronic kidney disease, remains unclear. In this study, ultrastructural analysis of serial human kidney biopsies showed that long-term use of ERT reduced Gb3 accumulation in podocytes but did not reverse podocyte injury. Then, a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated α-galactosidase knockout podocyte cell line confirmed ERT-mediated reversal of Gb3 accumulation without resolution of lysosomal dysfunction. Transcriptome-based connectivity mapping and SILAC-based quantitative proteomics identified α-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation as a key event mediating podocyte injury. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SNCA improved lysosomal structure and function in Fabry podocytes, exceeding the benefits of ERT. Together, this work reconceptualizes Fabry-associated cell injury beyond Gb3 accumulation, and introduces SNCA modulation as a potential intervention, especially for patients with Fabry nephropathy."

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) can be a valuable diagnostic tool in patients with unexplained CKD, with a diagnostic yield of 12%-56%. Here, we report the use of MPS to establish a genetic diagnosis in a 24-year-old index patient who presented with hypertension, nephrotic-range proteinuria and kidney failure of unknown origin. Additionally, we describe a second family with the same mutation presenting with early-onset CKD. In Family 1, MPS identified a known pathogenic variant in <i>GLA</i> (p.Ile319Thr), and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine and α-galactosidase A activity were compatible with the diagnosis of Fabry disease (FD). Segregation analysis identified three other family members carrying the same pathogenic variant who had mild or absent kidney phenotypes. One family member was offered enzyme therapy. While FD could not be established with certainty as the cause of kidney failure in the index patient, no alternative explanation was found. In Family 2, the index patient had severe glomerulosclerosis and a kidney biopsy compatible with FD at the age of 30 years, along with cardiac involvement and a history of acroparesthesia since childhood, in keeping with a more classical Fabry phenotype. These findings highlight the large phenotypic heterogeneity associated with <i>GLA</i> mutations in FD and underline several important implications of MPS in the work-up of patients with unexplained kidney failure."

This national, multicenter, cross-sectional, single-arm, observational registry study was conducted in adult patients with a clinical echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy and/or the presence of prominent papillary muscle. In both genders, genetic analysis was performed by DNA Sanger sequence analysis. A total of 406 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy of unknown origin were included. Of the patients, 19.5% had decreased enzyme activity (≤2.5 nmol/mL/h). Although genetic analysis revealed GLA (galactosidase alpha) gene mutation in only 2 patients (0.5%), these patients were considered to have probable but not 'definite Fabry disease' due to normal lyso Gb3 levels and gene mutations categorized as variants of unknown significance. The prevalence of Fabry disease varies according to the characteristics of the population screened and the definition of the disease used in these trials. From cardiology perspective, left ventricular hypertrophy is the major reason to consider screening for Fabry disease. Enzyme testing, genetic analysis, substrate analysis, histopathological examination, and family screening should be performed, when necessary, for a definite diagnosis of Fabry disease. The results of this study underline the importance of the comprehensive use of these diagnostic tools to reach a definite diagnosis. The diagnosis and management of Fabry disease should not be based solely on the results of the screening tests."

While its functional role in vascular tone is well described, its role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease is of interest as a potential therapeutic target. We performed a systematic review to provide an overview of new therapeutic and diagnostic targets for the treatment of coronary artery disease related to endothelial dysfunction. Databases of PubMed, Ovid's version of MEDLINE, and EMBASE were interrogated with appropriate search terms. Inclusion criteria have been met by 28 studies that were included in the final systematic review. We identified inflammation, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus and Fabry disease as pathophysiological mechanisms and explored the therapeutic options related to these conditions including medications such as Canakinumab. Endothelial dysfunction has a key role in several different pathophysiological processes which can be targeted for therapeutic options. Ongoing research should be targeted at making the transition to clinical practice. Further research is also needed on understanding the amelioration of endothelial dysfunction with the use of cardiovascular medications."

Given the small number of cases and the lack of profit potential, pharmaceutical companies have not invested much in the development of possible treatments. However, over the last few years, new therapies for rare diseases have emerged, giving physicians a chance to offer personalized treatment. With this paper, we aim to present some of the orphan neurological diseases for which new drugs have been developed lately. We have conducted a literature review of the papers concerning rare diseases and their treatment, and we have analyzed the existing studies for each orphan drug. For this purpose, we have used the Google Scholar search engine and the Orphanet. We have selected the studies published in the last 15 years. Since the formation of the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the Orphan Drug Act, and the National Institutes of Health Office of Rare Diseases, pharmacological companies have made a lot of progress concerning the development of new drugs. Therefore, diseases that until recently were without therapeutic solutions benefit today from personalized treatment. We have detailed in our study over 15 neurological and systemic diseases with neurological implications, for which the last 10-15 years have brought important innovations regarding their treatment. Many steps have been taken towards the treatment of these patients, and the humanity and professionalism of the pharmaceutical companies, along with the constant support of the patient's associations for rare diseases, have led to the discovery of new treatments and useful future findings."

    "title": "Proteomic Approaches and Potential Applications in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Although rare, hereditary diseases, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and Fabry disease (FD) may significantly progress towards severe nephropathy. It is crucial to characterize it accurately, predict the course of the illness and estimate treatment effectiveness. A huge effort has been undertaken to find reliable biomarkers that might be useful for an early prevention of the disease progression and/or any invasive diagnostic procedures. The study of proteomics, or the small peptide composition of a sample, is a field of study under continuous development. Over the past years, several strategies have been created to study and define the proteome of samples from widely varying origins. However, urinary proteomics has become essential for discovering novel biomarkers in kidney disease. Here, the extracellular vesicles in human urine that contain cell-specific marker proteins from every segment of the nephron, offer a source of potentially valuable urinary biomarkers, and may play an essential role in kidney development and kidney disease. This review summarizes the relevant literature investigating the proteomic approaches and potential applications in the regular studies of ADPKD and FD."

    "title": "Magnitude of the Potential Screening Gap for Fabry Disease in Manitoba: A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare disorder caused by the deficient activity of α-galactosidase A (GLA) that often leads to organ damage. Fabry disease can be treated with enzyme replacement or pharmacological therapy, but due to its rarity and nonspecific manifestations, it often goes undiagnosed. Mass screening for Fabry disease is impractical; however, a targeted screening program for high-risk individuals may uncover previously unknown cases. Our objective was to use population-level administrative health databases to identify patients at high risk of Fabry disease. Retrospective cohort study. Population-level health administrative databases housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. All residents of Manitoba, Canada, between 1998 and 2018. We ascertained the evidence of GLA testing in a cohort of patients at high risk of Fabry disease. Individuals without a hospitalization or prescription indicative of Fabry disease were included if they had evidence of 1 of 4 high-risk conditions for Fabry disease: (1) ischemic stroke <45 years of age, (2) idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, (3) proteinuric chronic kidney disease or kidney failure of unknown cause, or (4) peripheral neuropathy. Patients were excluded if they had known contributing factors to these high-risk conditions. Those who remained and had no prior GLA testing were assigned a 0% to 4.2% probability of having Fabry disease depending on their high-risk condition and sex. After applying exclusion criteria, 1386 individuals were identified as having at least 1 high-risk clinical condition for Fabry disease in Manitoba. There were 416 GLA tests conducted during the study period, and of those, 22 were conducted in individuals with at least 1 high-risk condition. This leaves a screening gap of 1364 individuals with a high-risk clinical condition for Fabry disease in Manitoba who have not been tested. At the end of the study period, 932 of those individuals were still alive and residing in Manitoba, and if screened today, we expect between 3 and 18 would test positive for Fabry disease. The algorithms we used to identify our patients have not been validated elsewhere. Diagnoses of Fabry disease, idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral neuropathy were only available via hospitalizations and not physician claims. We were only able to capture GLA testing processed through public laboratories. Patients identified to be at high risk of Fabry disease by the algorithm did not undergo GLA testing due to a clinical rationale that we were unable to capture. Administrative health databases may be a useful tool to identify patients at higher risk of Fabry disease or other rare conditions. Further directions include designing a program to screen high-risk individuals for Fabry disease as identified by our administrative data algorithms."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A (GLA) leading to the lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other glycosphingolipids. Fabry patients experience significant damage to the heart, kidney, and blood vessels that can be fatal. Here we apply directed evolution to generate more stable GLA variants as potential next generation treatments for Fabry disease. GLAv05 and GLAv09 were identified after screening more than 12,000 GLA variants through 8 rounds of directed evolution. Both GLAv05 and GLAv09 exhibit increased stability at both lysosomal and blood pH, stability to serum, and elevated enzyme activity in treated Fabry fibroblasts (19-fold) and GLA<sup>-/-</sup> podocytes (10-fold). GLAv05 and GLAv09 show improved pharmacokinetics in mouse and non-human primates. In a Fabry mouse model, the optimized variants showed prolonged half-lives in serum and relevant tissues, and a decrease of accumulated Gb3 in heart and kidney. To explore the possibility of diminishing the immunogenic potential of rhGLA, amino acid residues in sequences predicted to bind MHC II were targeted in late rounds of GLAv09 directed evolution. An MHC II-associated peptide proteomics assay confirmed a reduction in displayed peptides for GLAv09. Collectively, our findings highlight the promise of using directed evolution to generate enzyme variants for more effective treatment of lysosomal storage diseases."

    "abstract": "In 2016, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of existing data on the effects of switch from agalsidase beta to alfa in patients with Fabry disease showed that the switch was well tolerated and associated with stable disease progression. However, additional evidence that supports the need for an update of the review on the long-term effects of switching to agalsidase alfa, with a mention on the effects of reswitch to agalsidase beta, has emerged. Relevant papers were identified on PubMed, Cochrane, ISI Web, and Scopus databases from September 2015 to December 2021. Analyzed parameters were clinical events, changes in organ function or structure, disease related symptoms, lyso-globotriasolylceramide 3 (lyso-Gb3) plasma levels, presence of antidrug antibodies, and adverse effects. In total, 15 publications were evaluated, with a total of 353 subjects. The results of the review confirmed some points of the previous analysis with some new important information. After the switch from agalsidase beta to alfa, an increased number of clinical events, a significant loss of renal function, and an increase in lyso-Gb3 levels were reported; conversely, lyso-Gb3 levels decreased after the switch from agalsidase alfa to beta. The results confirm the importance of dose and recommend that patients be monitored through intensified surveillance, including lyso-Gb3 levels every 6 months."

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCM) are caused in 30-60% of cases by mutations in cardiac sarcomere genes but can also be an expression of cardiac involvement in multi-systemic metabolic diseases, such as Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD). HCM entails a risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) of 0.9%/year and is the most common cause of SCD in young adults. Recent studies suggested mechanical dispersion (MD) by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) as an additional arrhythmic risk marker. The aim of the study was to evaluate left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and MD, in patients with HCM or AFD cardiomyopathy, and the association with ventricular arrhythmias (V-AR). We evaluated 40 patients with HCM, 57 with AFD (12 with LV hypertrophy and 45 without), and 40 healthy subjects, between January 2014 and June 2022. We performed a comprehensive echocardiographic study and analysed systolic and diastolic functions, LV-GLS, and MD. We also analysed V-AR, including ventricular fibrillation and sustained/non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, by Holter electrocardiogram (Holter-EKG), in a subset of hypertrophic patients. Data were analysed by unpaired Student <i>t</i>-test or chi-square/Fisher's exact test as appropriate and binary logistic regression (SPSS Statistics ver.26). LV-GLS was significantly lower in the V-AR group compared with patients without V-AR (median -10.2% vs. -14%, <i>P</i> = 0.038); MD was significantly higher in the V-AR group (85.5 ms vs. 61.1 ms, <i>P</i> = 0.004). V-AR were found significantly associated with MD (OR, 1.030; 95% CI, 1.003-1.058; <i>P</i> = 0.03). MD is a useful additional index in the evaluation of patients with HCM and may be a promising prognostic predictor of increased arrhythmic risk."

    "title": "Increased cardiac involvement in Fabry disease using blood-corrected native T1 mapping.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder resulting in myocardial sphingolipid accumulation which is detectable by cardiovascular magnetic resonance as low native T1. However, myocardial T1 contains signal from intramyocardial blood which affects variability and consequently measurement precision and accuracy. Correction of myocardial T1 by blood T1 increases precision. We therefore deployed a multicenter study of FD patients (n = 218) and healthy controls (n = 117) to investigate if blood-correction of myocardial native T1 increases the number of FD patients with low T1, and thus reclassifies FD patients as having cardiac involvement. Cardiac involvement was defined as a native T1 value 2 standard deviations below site-specific means in healthy controls for both corrected and uncorrected measures. Overall low T1 was 135/218 (62%) uncorrected vs. 145/218 (67%) corrected (p = 0.02). With blood-correction, 13/83 previously normal patients were reclassified to low T1. This reclassification appears clinically relevant as 6/13 (46%) of reclassified had focal late gadolinium enhancement or left ventricular hypertrophy as signs of cardiac involvement. Blood-correction of myocardial native T1 increases the proportion of FD subjects with low myocardial T1, with blood-corrected results tracking other markers of cardiac involvement. Blood-correction may potentially offer earlier detection and therapy initiation, but merits further prospective studies."

Her son in his 40s, two granddaughters and two great grandsons carried T410A/<i>GLA</i>. The son had a history of hypertension and paroxysmal AF but no microalbuminuria or classic symptoms or signs of FD. Baseline α-galactosidase A enzyme (α-Gal A) activity varied from 0% to 26.5%. Cardiac MRI showed mild Fabry cardiomyopathy (FC). During 11 years of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), FC progressed and he suffered sudden cardiac death in his 50s. The great grandsons with T410A/<i>GLA</i> had no active α-Gal A, high lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> levels and normal cardiac imaging. They suffered from neuropathic pain and gastrointestinal symptoms and were started with ERT at the age under 10. Granddaughters with T410A/<i>GLA</i> had α-Gal A activities of 8-18 and 10% of normal. The older granddaughter in her 30s was diagnosed with incipient FC. Plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> analogues were elevated, markedly in the elder male with FC and moderately in the elder granddaughter. In young males with classic phenotype, plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> analogues were only slightly elevated. The T410A/<i>GLA</i> mutation caused late-onset FD with progressive cardiomyopathy in elder male, and classic FD in young males of the same family. Varying levels of α-Gal A and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> analogues reflected variable phenotype of FD in the family."

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is commonly detected in Fabry disease (FD), cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and hypertension (HTN). The study aimed to demonstrate the characteristics of myocardial work in patients with LVH suffering from FD, CA, and HTN. Echocardiography were performed in patients with LVH suffering from FD (n = 13), light chain associated cardiac amyloidosis (AL-CA) (n = 29) and HTN (n = 72), 25 healthy controls were also included in the current study. Conventional and myocardial work parameters were assessed and compared among FD, AL-CA, HTN and controls. Patients with FD and AL-CA were included in the group of infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors for discriminating infiltrative cardiomyopathy from hypertension. Compared with controls, HTN patients had preserved global work index (GWI) and global constructive work (GCW) and reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global work efficiency (GWE) (p < 0.05), but patients with FD and AL-CA had reduced GLS, GWI, GCW and GWE and increased global wasted work (GWW) (p < 0.05). GWI and GCW could discriminate infiltrative cardiomyopathy from HTN independently with high accuracy (GWI cut-off value 1626 mmHg%, sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.82, area under the curve 0.90; GCW cut-off value 2021 mmHg%, sensitivity 0.84, specificity 0.88, area under the curve 0.91). GWI and GCW were reduced in FD and AL-CA patients, but not in patients with HTN. Myocardial work had an addictive value in differentiating infiltrative cardiomyopathy from hypertension."

In addition, we aimed to raise awareness about this issue by allowing early diagnosis and treatment of FD. Our study was planned as national, multicenter, observational. Totally 22 different centers participated in this study. A total of 886 patients diagnosed with LVH by echocardiography (ECHO) were included in the study. Demographic data, biochemical parameters, electrocardiography (ECG) findings, ECHO findings, treatments and clinical findings of the patients were recorded. Dry blood samples were sent from male patients with suspected FD. The α-Gal A enzyme level was checked and genetic testing was performed in patients with low enzyme levels. Female patients suspected of FD were genetically tested with the GLA Gene Mutation Analysis. FD was suspected in a total of 143 (16.13%) patients included in the study. The α-Gal-A enzyme level was found to be low in 43 (4.85%) patients whom enzyme testing was requested. GLA gene mutation analysis was positive in 14 (1.58%) patients. Male gender, E/e' mean ,and severe hypertrophy are important risk factor for FD. In daily cardiology practice, FD should be kept in mind not only in adult patients with unexplained LVH but also in the entire LVH population. Dry blood test (DBS) should be considered in high-risk patients, and mutation analysis should be considered in required patients."

    "abstract": "Currently available enzyme replacement therapies for lysosomal storage diseases are limited in their effectiveness due in part to short circulation times and suboptimal biodistribution of the therapeutic enzymes. We previously engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to produce α-galactosidase A (GLA) with various N-glycan structures and demonstrated that elimination of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) and conversion to homogeneous sialylated N-glycans prolonged circulation time and improved biodistribution of the enzyme following a single-dose infusion into Fabry mice. Here, we confirmed these findings using repeated infusions of the glycoengineered GLA into Fabry mice and further tested whether this glycoengineering approach, Long-Acting-GlycoDesign (LAGD), could be implemented on other lysosomal enzymes. LAGD-engineered CHO cells stably expressing a panel of lysosomal enzymes [aspartylglucosamine (AGA), beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), cathepsin D (CTSD), tripeptidyl peptidase (TPP1), alpha-glucosidase (GAA) or iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS)] successfully converted all M6P-containing N-glycans to complex sialylated N-glycans. The resulting homogenous glycodesigns enabled glycoprotein profiling by native mass spectrometry. Notably, LAGD extended the plasma half-life of all three enzymes tested (GLA, GUSB, AGA) in wildtype mice. LAGD may be widely applicable to lysosomal replacement enzymes to improve their circulatory stability and therapeutic efficacy."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked disease characterized by deficient expression and activity of alpha-galactosidase A (α-GalA) with consequent lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipid in various organs. Currently, enzyme replacement therapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of all Fabry patients, although in the long-term it fails to completely halt the disease's progression. This suggests on one hand that the adverse outcomes cannot be justified only by the lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids and on the other that additional therapies targeted at specific secondary mechanisms might contribute to halt the progression of cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal disease that occur in Fabry patients. Several studies reported how secondary biochemical processes beyond Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulation-such as oxidative stress, compromised energy metabolism, altered membrane lipid, disturbed cellular trafficking, and impaired autophagy-might exacerbate Fabry disease adverse outcomes. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of these pathogenetic intracellular mechanisms in Fabry disease, which might suggest novel additional strategies for its treatment."

    "abstract": "Enzyme replacement therapy is the only therapeutic option for Fabry patients with completely absent AGAL activity. However, the treatment has side effects, is costly, and requires conspicuous amounts of recombinant human protein (rh-AGAL). Thus, its optimization would benefit patients and welfare/health services (i.e., society at large). In this brief report, we describe preliminary results paving the way for two possible approaches: i. the combination of enzyme replacement therapy with pharmacological chaperones; and ii. the identification of AGAL interactors as possible therapeutic targets on which to act. We first showed that galactose, a low-affinity pharmacological chaperone, can prolong AGAL half-life in patient-derived cells treated with rh-AGAL. Then, we analyzed the interactomes of intracellular AGAL on patient-derived AGAL-defective fibroblasts treated with the two rh-AGALs approved for therapeutic purposes and compared the obtained interactomes to the one associated with endogenously produced AGAL (data available as PXD039168 on ProteomeXchange). Common interactors were aggregated and screened for sensitivity to known drugs. Such an interactor-drug list represents a starting point to deeply screen approved drugs and identify those that can affect (positively or negatively) enzyme replacement therapy."

Despite recent advances in genetic technology and skin imaging modalities, dermoscopy can be useful for screening, diagnosis, and treatment follow-up. In ectopic mineralization and lysosomal storage disorders (pseudoxanthoma elasticum and Fabry disease, respectively), cutaneous manifestations may indicate involvement of other organs. In keratinization diseases (e.g., ichthyoses) and acantholytic skin fragility disorders (e.g., Darier and Hailey-Hailey disease), dermoscopy may help to assess treatment response by visualizing background erythema, hyperkeratosis, and interkeratinocyte space prominence.

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle (SM) pain and fatigue are common in Fabry disease (FD). Here, we undertook the investigation of the energetic mechanisms related to FD-SM phenotype. A reduced tolerance to aerobic activity and lactate accumulation occurred in FD-mice and patients. Accordingly, in murine FD-SM we detected an increase in fast/glycolytic fibers, mirrored by glycolysis upregulation. In FD-patients, we confirmed a high glycolytic rate and the underutilization of lipids as fuel. In the quest for a tentative mechanism, we found HIF-1 upregulated in FD-mice and patients. This finding goes with miR-17 upregulation that is responsible for metabolic remodeling and HIF-1 accumulation. Accordingly, miR-17 antagomir inhibited HIF-1 accumulation, reverting the metabolic-remodeling in FD-cells. Our findings unveil a Warburg effect in FD, an anaerobic-glycolytic switch under normoxia induced by miR-17-mediated HIF-1 upregulation. Exercise-intolerance, blood-lactate increase, and the underlying miR-17/HIF-1 pathway may become useful therapeutic targets and diagnostic/monitoring tools in FD."

The MSSI (Mainz Severity Score Index) scale was used to evaluate the clinical data of five children diagnosed in our hospital, and the genotypes of all the patients with FD were collected. Two of the male children started ERT. We summarize the clinical effect and the evaluation of globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-GL-3) before and after treatment. Five children were confirmed as having FD using the family histories, clinical manifestations, <i>α</i>-galactosidase A (a-Gal A) activity, and genetic test results. Two children used agalsidase <i>α</i> every 2 weeks regularly, after ERT. Their clinical symptoms improved, their pain intensity was significantly relieved, and upon re-examination their Lyso-GL-3 decreased conspicuously and no serious adverse reactions occurred. We report for the first time four families with children with FD. The youngest child was only 1 year old. The four families included one girl which is rare in X-linked lysosomal storage diseases. The clinical phenotype of FD in childhood is nonspecific, and the misdiagnosis rate is high. Most children with FD have a delayed diagnosis, and their organs are often seriously damaged in adulthood. Pediatricians must improve their diagnosis and treatment awareness, screen high-risk groups, and emphasize multidisciplinary cooperation and holistic lifestyle management after diagnosis. The diagnosis of the proband is also conducive to the mining of other cases of FD families and has important guiding significance for prenatal diagnosis."

A 48-year-old male patient was admitted to a tertiary care hospital with chest pain and dyspnoea. Bilateral hearing loss required hearing aids at the age of 40. A short PQ interval, narrow QRS complex, and inverted T-waves in lateral leads were present on the electrocardiogram. HbA1c of 7.3 mmol/L indicated prediabetes. Echocardiography excluded valvular heart disease and detected non-obstructive HCM with slightly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (48%). Coronary artery disease was ruled out by coronary angiography. Myocardial fibrosis determined by repeated cardiac MRI progressed over time. Endomyocardial biopsy excluded storage disease, Fabry disease, and infiltrative and inflammatory cardiac disease. Genetic testing revealed m.3243A > G mutation in the <i>MT-TL1</i> gene associated with mitochondrial disease. Clinical evaluation and genetic testing of the patients' family revealed five genotype-positive relatives with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes including deafness, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with unexplained symmetric HCM with heterogenic clinical phenotypes at the organ levels, mitochondrial disease should be taken into consideration, particularly in the context of matrilinear transmission. m.3243A > G mutation is associated with mitochondrial disease in the index patient and five family members and leads to the diagnosis of maternally inherited diabetes and deafness with intra-familial variability of different cardiomyopathy forms."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal rare disease due to a deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity. The accumulation of glycosphingolipids mainly affects the kidney, heart, and central nervous system, considerably reducing life expectancy. Although the accumulation of undegraded substrate is considered the primary cause of FD, it is established that secondary dysfunctions at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels ultimately give rise to the clinical phenotype. To parse this biological complexity, a large-scale deep plasma targeted proteomic profiling has been performed. We analyzed the plasma protein profiles of FD deeply phenotyped patients (n = 55) compared to controls (n = 30) using next-generation plasma proteomics including 1463 proteins. Systems biology and machine learning approaches have been used. The analysis enabled the identification of proteomic profiles that unambiguously separated FD patients from controls (615 differentially expressed proteins, 476 upregulated, and 139 downregulated) and 365 proteins are newly reported. We observed functional remodeling of several processes, such as cytokine-mediated pathways, extracellular matrix, and vacuolar/lysosomal proteome. Using network strategies, we probed patient-specific tissue metabolic remodeling and described a robust predictive consensus protein signature including 17 proteins CD200, SPINT1, CD34, FGFR2, GRN, ERBB4, AXL, ADAM15, PTPRM, IL13RA1, NBL1, NOTCH1, VASN, ROR1, AMBP, CCN3, and HAVCR2. Our findings highlight the pro-inflammatory cytokines' involvement in FD pathogenesis along with extracellular matrix remodeling. The study shows a tissue-wide metabolic remodeling connection to plasma proteomics in FD. These results will facilitate further studies to understand the molecular mechanisms in FD to pave the way for better diagnostics and therapeutics."

Myocardial denervation ([11C]mHED retention < 7%·min) was prevalent only in patients with fibrosis, where a total of 16 denervated segments was found in two patients. The respective area of denervation exceeded the area of LGE in both patients (24% vs. 36% and 4% vs. 32%). However, sympathetic innervation defects ([11C]mHED retention ≤ 9%·min) occurred in all study groups. Furthermore, a reduced sympathetic innervation correlated with an increased left ventricular mass (p = .034, rs = - 0.57) and a reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) (p = 0.023, rs = - 0.6). Hybrid cardiac PET/MR with [11C]mHED revealed sympathetic innervation defects, accompanied by impaired GLS, in early stages of Fabry disease. However, denervation is only present in patients with advanced stages of FD showing fibrosis on CMR."

    "abstract": "Sphingolipidoses are defined as a group of rare hereditary diseases resulting from mutations in the genes encoding lysosomal enzymes. This group of lysosomal storage diseases includes more than 10 genetic disorders, including GM1-gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Farber disease, etc. Enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of sphingolipids in various cell types, and the nervous system is also usually affected. There are currently no known effective methods for the treatment of sphingolipidoses; however, gene therapy seems to be a promising therapeutic variant for this group of diseases. In this review, we discuss gene therapy approaches for sphingolipidoses that are currently being investigated in clinical trials, among which adeno-associated viral vector-based approaches and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells genetically modified with lentiviral vectors seem to be the most effective."

Lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> and related analogues are useful biomarkers for screening and should be routinely monitored for longitudinal patient evaluation. In recent years, a growing interest has emerged in the analysis of FD biomarkers in dried blood spots (DBSs), considering the several advantages compared to venipuncture as a technique for collecting whole-blood specimens. The focus of this study was to devise and validate a UHPLC-MS/MS method for the analysis of lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> and related analogues in DBSs to facilitate sample collection and shipment to reference laboratories. The assay was devised in conventional DBS collection cards and in Capitainer<sup>®</sup>B blood collection devices using both capillary and venous blood specimens from 12 healthy controls and 20 patients affected with FD. The measured biomarker concentrations were similar in capillary and venous blood specimens. The hematocrit (Hct) did not affect the correlation between plasma and DBS measurements in our cohort (Hct range: 34.3-52.2%). This UHPLC-MS/MS method using DBS would facilitate high-risk screening and the follow-up and monitoring of patients affected with FD."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the α-galactosidase-A enzyme. The result is the progressive accumulation of complex glycosphingolipids and cellular dysfunction. Cardiac, renal, and neurological involvement significantly reduces life expectancy. Currently, there is increasing evidence that clinical response to treatment improves with early and timely initiation. Until a few years ago, treatment options for Fabry disease were limited to enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa or beta administered by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. Migalastat (Galafold<sup>®</sup>) is an oral pharmacological chaperone that increases the enzyme activity of \"amenable\" mutations. The safety and efficacy of migalastat were supported in the phase III FACETS and ATTRACT studies, compared to available enzyme replacement therapies, showing a reduction in left ventricular mass, and stabilization of kidney function and plasma Lyso-Gb3. Similar results were confirmed in subsequent extension publications, both in patients who started migalastat as their first treatment and in patients who were previously on enzyme replacement therapy and switched to migalastat. In this review we describe the safety and efficacy of switching from enzyme replacement therapy to migalastat in patients with Fabry disease and \"amenable\" mutations, referring to publications available to date."

To evaluate the risks of clonal dominance and leukemogenesis, which have been reported in multiple gene therapy trials, we conducted a comprehensive DNA insertion site analysis of peripheral blood samples from the five patients in our gene therapy trial. We found that patients had a polyclonal integration site spectrum and did not find evidence of a dominant clone in any patient. Although we identified vector integrations near proto-oncogenes, these had low percentages of contributions to the overall pool of integrations and did not persist over time. Overall, we show that our trial of lentivirus-mediated gene therapy for Fabry disease did not lead to hematopoietic clonal dominance and likely did not elevate the risk of leukemogenic transformation."

The clinical data, laboratory tests, genetic variations and treatment of 10 FD children diagnosed in Shandong Provincial Hospital from September 2020 to June 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 10 cases from 6 families, 7 patients were boys of 4 to 13 years of age, and 3 were girls of 12 to 15 years of age. There were 7 symptomatic patients, including 6 boys and 1 girl. All 7 patients presented with acral neuralgia. Five patients had little or no sweating. Five patients presented with cutaneous angiokeratoma. Two patients had abdominal pain. One patient developed joint symptoms. Four patients had corneal opacity. One patient had hearing loss; one patient had short stature. One patient had mild proteinuria and 1 patient had dysplasia of the right kidney with decreased eGFR (55.28 ml/min.1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The left ventricular mass index was slightly elevated in 1 patient. Three patients had mild obstructive ventilatory dysfunction; a small amount of effusion in the intestinal space of the lower abdomen or mild fatty liver was found in 2 patients. Partial empty sella turcica in 1 patient. A total of 6 GLA gene variants were detected in 10 children, among which C.1059_1061delGAT (p.met353del) was a newly discovered mutation. Five children received ERT, of which 4 were treated with agalsidase beta and 1 was treated with agalsidase alpha. Only 1 patient had anaphylaxis. Lyso-GL-3 levels decreased significantly in the first 3 months of ERT initiation and remained relatively stable thereafter in 3 patients. The Lyso-GL-3 level was decreased, but renal impairment continued to progress in 1 patient treated with agalsidase alpha. The clinical manifestations of FD in childhood are diverse, and it is necessary to make a definite diagnosis by combining family history, enzyme activity, biomarkers, gene testing and other indicators. Pedigree screening and high-risk population screening are helpful for early identification, early diagnosis and early treatment. No serious adverse reactions were found during the short-term treatment with agalsidase alpha and beta."

Here, we explore using pulsed laser beams as an alternative method of generating high fluences. We find through forward-stepping finite element models that picosecond or shorter interactions are required for meaningful fluences and phase shifts, with higher pulse energies and smaller beam waists leading to predicted higher fluences. An additional model based on quasi-classical assumptions is used to discover the shape of the phase plate by incorporating the oscillatory nature of the electric field. From these results, we find the transient nature of the laser pulses removes the influence of Kapitza-Dirac diffraction patterns that appear in the static resonator cases. We conclude by predicting that a total laser pulse energy of 8.7 μJ is enough to induce the required π/2 phase shift for Zernike-like phase microscopy."

Both FD patients derived hiPSCs had the same mutations as those detected in PBMCs of patients, showing typical pluripotency markers, normal karyotyping, and successful tri-lineage differentiation. Kidney organoids generated using WT-hiPSC and both FD patients derived hiPSCs expressed typical nephron markers without structural deformity. Activity of α-GalA was decreased and deposition of Gb-3 was increased in FD patients derived hiPSCs and kidney organoids in comparison with WT, with such changes being far more significant in CMC-Fb-001 than in CMC-Fb-003. In EM finding, multi-lammelated inclusion body was detected in both CMC-Fb-001 and CMC-Fb-003 kidney organoids, but not in WT.

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disease due to a genetic variation in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene. As a result, the activity of the α-galactosidase A (AGAL-A) enzyme is reduced or absent, which causes sphingolipid deposition within different body parts. AFD typically manifests with cardiovascular, renal, cerebrovascular, and dermatologic involvement. Lymphedema is caused by sphingolipid deposition within lymphatics. Lymphedema can cause intolerable pain and limit daily activities. Very limited data exist on lymphedema in AFD patients. Using data from the Fabry Registry (NCT00196742) with 7671 patients included (44% males and 56% females), we analyzed the prevalence of lymphedema among AFD patients who were ever assessed for lymphedema and studied the age of first reported lymphedema. Additionally, we assessed whether patients received AFD-specific treatment at some point during their clinical course. The data was stratified by gender and phenotype. Our study showed that lymphedema occurred in 16.5% of the Fabry Registry patients who were ever assessed for lymphedema (n = 5487). Male patients when compared to female patient have higher prevalence (21.7% vs 12.7%) and experienced lymphedema at a younger age (median age at first reported lymphedema of 43.7 vs 51.7 years). When compared to other phenotypes, classic phenotype has the highest prevalence of lymphedema with the earliest reported lymphedema. Among those who reported lymphedema, 84.5% received AFD-specific treatment during their clinical course. Lymphedema is a common manifestation of AFD in both genders, with a tendency to present later in female patients. Recognition of lymphedema can offer an important opportunity for intervention and potential impact on associated morbidity. Additional future studies are needed to characterize the clinical implications of lymphedema in AFD patients and identify additional treatment options for this growing population."

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of melanoma and other cancers. However, no reliable biomarker of survival or response has entered the clinic to identify those patients with melanoma who are most likely to benefit from ICIs. Glycosylation affects proteins and lipids' structure and functions. Tumours are characterized by aberrant glycosylation which may contribute to their progression and hinder an effective antitumour immune response. We aim at identifying novel glyco-markers of response and survival by leveraging the N-glycome of total serum proteins collected in 88 ICI-naive patients with advanced melanoma from two European countries. Samples were collected before and during ICI treatment. We observe that responders to ICIs present with a pre-treatment N-glycome profile significantly shifted towards higher abundancy of low-branched structures containing lower abundances of antennary fucose, and that this profile is positively associated with survival and a better predictor of response than clinical variables alone. While changes in serum protein glycosylation have been previously implicated in a pro-metastatic melanoma behaviour, we show here that they are also associated with response to ICI, opening new avenues for the stratification of patients and the design of adjunct therapies aiming at improving immune response."

We generated FDN patient-derived hiPSC (CMC-Fb-002) and FD-specific hiPSCs (GLA-KO) by knock-out (KO) of GLA in wild-type (WT) hiPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9. We then performed A4GALT KO in both CMC-Fb-002 and GLA-KO to make Fb-002-A4GALT-KO and GLA/A4GALT-KO, respectively. Using these hiPSCs, we generated kidney organoids and compared alpha-galactosidase-A enzyme (α-GalA) activity, globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) deposition, and zebra body formation under electron microscopy (EM). We also compared mRNA expression levels using RNA-seq and qPCR. Generated hiPSCs showed typical pluripotency markers without chromosomal disruption. Expression levels of GLA in CMC-Fb-002 and GLA-KO and expression levels of A4GALT in Fb-002-A4GALT-KO and GLA/A4GALT-KO were successfully decreased compared to those in WT-hiPSCs, respectively. Generated kidney organoids using these hiPSCs expressed typical nephron markers. In CMC-Fb-002 and GLA-KO organoids, α-GalA activity was significantly decreased along with increased deposition of Gb-3 in comparison with WT organoids. Intralysosomal inclusion body was also detected under EM. However, these disease phenotypes were rescued by KO of A4GALT in both GLA/A4GALT-KO and Fb-002-A4GALT-KO kidney organoids. RNA-seq showed increased expression levels of genes related to FDN progression in both GLA-mutant organoids compared to those in WT. Such increases were rescued in GLA/A4GALT-KO or Fb-002-A4GALT-KO organoids. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated suppression of A4GALT could rescue FDN phenotype.

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are reported in FD with a prevalence of about 50%, usually treated by Enzymatic Replacement Therapy (ERT) or oral treatment. Since FODMAPs (<i>Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols</i>) can be involved in GI manifestations and dysbiosis in FD patients, a low-<i>FODMAP</i> diet could represent an alternative adjunctive treatment in FD subjects, as well as being useful for reducing symptoms in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). We retrospectively assessed data from 36 adult FD patients followed at the Inherited Metabolic Rare Diseases Adult Centre of the University Hospital of Padova (mean age 47.6 ± 16.2 years). Patients were screened for GI symptoms by IBS severity score and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaires. In symptomatic patients, the low-<i>FODMAP</i> diet was proposed in order to improve GI manifestations; it consists of a phase of elimination of fermentable saccharides, succeeded by a gradual reintegration of the same. Severe or moderate GI symptoms were found in 61.1% of patients, with no correlation to the therapy in use, and significantly more severe in the classical form of FD. The protocol was completed by seven patients affected by severe GI manifestations, significantly higher than the others. The low-<i>FODMAP</i> diet significantly improved indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. This dietetic protocol seemed to have a positive impact on intestinal symptoms, by identifying and reducing the intake of the foods most related to the onset of disorders and improving the clinical manifestations. A low-<i>FODMAP</i> diet may be an effective alternative approach to improve intestinal manifestations and quality of life, and nutrition can play an important role in the multidisciplinary care of patients with FD."

To identify ECG markers that reflect early cardiac involvement and disease progression, we conducted a long term retrospective study in a large cohort of FD patients. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1995 ECGs from 133 patients with classical FD (64% females, 80% treated with enzyme replacement therapy), spanning 20 years of follow-up, were compared to ECGs from 3893 apparently healthy individuals. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effect of age, FD and sex on: P-wave duration, PR-interval, QRS-duration, QTc, Cornell index, spatial QRS-T angle and frontal QRS-axis. Regression slopes and absolute values for each parameter were compared between FD patients and control subjects. <b>Results:</b> At a younger age (<40 years), the Cornell index was higher and frontal QRS-axis more negative in FD patients compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.05). For the other ECG parameters, the rate of change, more than the absolute value, was greater in FD patients compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.05). From the fifth decade (men) or sixth (women) onwards, absolute values for P-wave duration, QRS-duration, QTc and spatial QRS-T angle were longer and higher in FD patients compared to control subjects. <b>Conclusions:</b> ECG abnormalities indicative of FD are age and sex dependent. Tracking the rate of change in ECG parameters could be a good way to detect disease progression, guiding treatment initiation. Moreover, monitoring ECG changes in FD can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment."

Careful consideration of patent foramen ovale closure is now recommended in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. Thrombectomy has recently been extended to carefully selected children with acute ischemic stroke, and two recent publications strongly suggest that it can be beneficial for children. Sickle cell is also an important global contributor to stroke burden, but hydroxyurea can be a cost effective medication for stroke prevention in children. Recent advances in genetic testing and treatments may improve outcomes for patients with monogenic causes of stroke, such as deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2, hemophilia, and Fabry's disease. Stroke in children and young adults is a morbid disease responsible for enormous indirect societal costs and a high burden of years with disability per affected patient.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) results in Gb3 clearance; however, because of a short half-life in the body and the high immunogenicity of FD patients, ERT has a limited therapeutic effect, particularly in patients with late-onset disease or progressive complications. Because vascular endothelial cells (VECs) derived from FD-induced pluripotent stem cells display increased thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) expression and enhanced SMAD2 signaling, we screened for chemical compounds that could downregulate TSP1 and SMAD2 signaling. Fasudil reduced the levels of p-SMAD2 and TSP1 in FD-VECs and increased the expression of angiogenic factors. Furthermore, fasudil downregulated the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and mitochondrial function of FD-VECs. Oral administration of fasudil to FD mice alleviated several FD phenotypes, including LVH, renal fibrosis, anhidrosis, and heat insensitivity. Our findings demonstrate that fasudil is a novel candidate for FD therapy."

Five patients in two families were described with two types of variants not previously described in the literature, with pathogenic behavior. Comparing the types of variants, the presence of a pathogenic variant was associated with higher levels of lysoGB3, lower values for alpha-GAL activity and higher frequency of symptoms related to FD.

Nearly all patients (n = 37, 92.5%) showed good therapy adherence (MAQ6M<sub>mean</sub>:3.93, MAQ12M<sub>mean</sub>:3.71 and MAQ24M<sub>mean</sub>:3.7). Only one patient fulfilled criteria for low adherence. Patient reported outcomes with completed SF-36 questionnaires were available in 28 patients (14 females). Over 24 months, significant improvement of pain and life role limitations due to physical activity was reported (Pain: change from baseline: 8.57 points, 95%-CI: 1.32-15.82, p = 0.022; role limitations physical: change from baseline: 13.39 points, 95%-CI: 0.61-23.2, p = 0.048). Migalastat therapy adherence in FD-patients was high and remained high over a follow-up period of 2 years. Patient reported quality of life remained mostly stable, while pain and physical limitations improved over time."

    "title": "Clinical outcomes among young patients with Fabry disease who initiated agalsidase beta treatment before 30 years of age: An analysis from the Fabry Registry.",
    "abstract": "Clinical manifestations of classic Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) usually occur in childhood, while complications involving major organs typically develop in adulthood. Outcomes of Fabry-specific treatment among young patients have not been extensively reported. Our aim was to analyze clinical outcomes among patients aged 5-30 years at initiation of treatment with agalsidase beta using data from the Fabry Registry (NCT00196742, sponsor: Sanofi). Reported GLA variants were predicted to be associated with the classic phenotype or not classified in fabry-database.org. Linear mixed models were conducted to assess changes over ≥2-year follow-up in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) stratified by low (LRI) and high (HRI) renal involvement (defined by proteinuria/albuminuria levels), and changes in interventricular septal thickness (IVST) and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) Z-scores stratified by median age at first treatment. Self-reports ('yes'/'no') of abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic peripheral pain (denoting neuropathic pain), and acute pain crises at baseline were compared with reports after ≥0.5-year and ≥2.5-year follow-up using McNemar's test. Male (n = 117) and female patients (n = 59) with LRI initiated treatment at a median age of 19.9 and 23.6 years, respectively, and were followed for a median of 6.3 and 5.0 years, respectively. The eGFR slopes were -1.18 (P<sub>from 0</sub> <0.001) and -0.92 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year (P<sub>from 0</sub> = 0.040), respectively. Males with HRI (n = 23, median UPCR 1.0 g/g), who started treatment at a median age of 26.7 years, had an eGFR slope of -2.39 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year (P<sub>from 0</sub> <0.001; P<sub>difference</sub> = 0.055, as compared with the slope of -1.18 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year for LRI males) during a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Echocardiographic variables were stable among males, regardless of age, and among young females (median follow-up >5.5 years and ≥4.5 years, respectively). Older females (treatment initiation at median age 27.5 years) had a slope of LVPWT Z-scores of 0.18/year (n = 12, P<sub>from 0</sub> = 0.028), whereas IVST Z-scores remained stable (n = 13, 0.10/year, P<sub>from 0</sub> = 0.304) during a median follow-up of ≥3.7 years. These slopes did not significantly differ from slopes of younger females. Reports of chronic peripheral pain and acute pain crises by males, and of diarrhea and acute pain crises by females, significantly reduced after a median follow-up of ≥4.0 years. After a median follow-up of ≥5.4 years, reports of all four symptoms significantly decreased among males, whereas among females only reports of abdominal pain significantly decreased. During sustained treatment with agalsidase beta in young Fabry patients with a predicted classic phenotype or with unclassified GLA variants with similar characteristics, the decline in eGFR was modest among male and female patients with LRI. The greater decline in eGFR among older, proteinuric (i.e., HRI) males may suggest a benefit of earlier treatment. Overall, echocardiographic variables remained stable, particularly among males and younger females. Significant reductions in symptom reports occurred primarily among males after longer follow-up and were less noticeable among females. These observed trends are suggestive of an overall improvement after treatment in young patients, but warrant larger longitudinal studies."

While imaging plays a key role in the early detection and accurate diagnosis in specific organs with a pivotal role in several metabolic pathways, most of these diseases affect different tissues as part of a systemic syndromes. Moreover, since the symptoms are often vague and phenotypes similar, imaging alterations can present as incidental findings, which must be recognized and interpreted in the light of further biochemical and histological investigations. Among imaging modalities, MRI allows, thanks to its multiparametric properties, to obtain numerous information on tissue composition, but many metabolic and accumulation alterations require a multimodal evaluation, possibly using advanced imaging techniques and sequences, not only for the detection but also for accurate characterization and quantification. The purpose of this review is to describe the different alterations resulting from metabolic and overload pathologies in organs and tissues throughout the body, with particular reference to imaging findings."

    "title": "Curcumin Has Beneficial Effects on Lysosomal Alpha-Galactosidase: Potential Implications for the Cure of Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene that encodes alpha-galactosidase (AGAL). The disease causes abnormal globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) storage in the lysosomes. Variants responsible for the genotypic spectrum of Fabry disease include mutations that abolish enzymatic activity and those that cause protein instability. The latter can be successfully treated with small molecules that either bind and stabilize AGAL or indirectly improve its cellular activity. This paper describes the first attempt to reposition curcumin, a nutraceutical, to treat Fabry disease. We tested the efficacy of curcumin in a cell model and found an improvement in AGAL activity for 80% of the tested mutant genotypes (four out of five tested). The fold-increase was dependent on the mutant and ranged from 1.4 to 2.2. We produced evidence that supports a co-chaperone role for curcumin when administered with AGAL pharmacological chaperones (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin and galactose). The combined treatment with curcumin and either pharmacological chaperone was beneficial for four out of five tested mutants and showed fold-increases ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 for DGJ and from 1.1 to 2.8 for galactose. Finally, we tested a long-term treatment on one mutant (L300F) and detected an improvement in Gb3 clearance and lysosomal markers (LAMP-1 and GAA). Altogether, our findings confirmed the necessity of personalized therapies for Fabry patients and paved the way to further studies and trials of treatments for Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive multisystemic disease characterized by lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is one of the most significant advancements and breakthroughs in treating FD. However, limited resources and the high cost of ERT might prevent patients from receiving prompt and effective therapy, thereby resulting in severe complications. Future progress in ERT can uncover promising treatment options. In this study, we developed and validated a recombinant enzyme (Lanzyme) based on a CHO-S cell system to provide a new potential option for FD therapy. Our results indicated that Lanzyme was heavily glycosylated, and its highest activity was similar to a commercial enzyme (Fabrazyme<sup>®</sup>). Our pharmacokinetic assessment revealed that the half-life of Lanzyme was up to 11 min, which is nearly twice that of the commercial enzyme. In vivo experiments revealed that Lanzyme treatment sharply decreased the accumulation levels of Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 in various tissues of FD model mice, with superior or comparable therapeutic effects to Fabrazyme<sup>®</sup>. Based on these data, Lanzyme may represent a new and promising treatment approach for FD. Building this enzyme production system for ERT can offer additional choice, potentially with enhanced efficacy, for the benefit of patients with FD."

This study aimed to assess the effect of migalastat on FD cardiac involvement, combining LV morphology and tissue characterisation by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Sixteen treatment-naïve patients with FD (4 women, 46.4±16.2 years) with cardiac involvement (reduced T1 values on CMR and/or LV hypertrophy) underwent ECG, echocardiogram, troponin T and NT-proBNP (N-Terminal prohormone of Brain Natriuretic Peptide) assay, CMR with T1 mapping, and CPET before and after 18 months of migalastat. No change in LV mass was detected at 18 months compared to baseline (95.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> (66.0-184.0) vs 99.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> (69.0-121.0), p=0.55). Overall, there was an increase in septal T1 of borderline significance (870.0 ms (848-882) vs 860.0 ms (833.0-875.0), p=0.056). Functional capacity showed an increase in oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) at anaerobic threshold (15.50 mL/kg/min (13.70-21.50) vs 14.50 mL/kg/min (11.70-18.95), p=0.02), and a trend towards an increase in percent predicted peak VO<sub>2</sub> (72.0 (63.0-80.0) vs 69.0 (53.0-77.0), p=0.056) was observed. The subset of patients who showed an increase in T1 value and a reduction in LV mass (n=7, 1 female, age 40.5 (28.6-76.0)) was younger and at an earlier disease stage compared to the others, and also exhibited greater improvement in exercise tolerance. In treatment-naïve FD patients with cardiac involvement, 18-month treatment with migalastat stabilised LV mass and was associated with a trend towards an improvement in exercise tolerance. A tendency to T1 increase was detected by CMR. The subset of patients who had significant benefits from the treatment showed an earlier cardiac disease compared to the others. NCT03838237."

    "abstract": "In Fabry Disease (FD), although the primary factor initiating kidney damage is glycosphingolipid accumulation, secondary conditions such as increased inflammation and fibrosis may cause this damage to progress. These processes may be induced by immune cells. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the peripheral lymphocyte subgroup analysis of the patients with FD and compare these results with healthy individuals. In addition, we performed T, B, NK, and plasma cell analyses in kidney biopsy materials and compared these kidney biopsy results with the biopsy results of patients whose kidney functions were impaired after 4 years of regular ERT. 18 FD and 16 healthy individuals were included in the study. T-B lymphocyte and NK-cell populations were determined. We performed kidney biopsies (KBx) on 13 patients with FD prior to ERT. Of these, 4 patients had rebiopsy after 4 years of regular ERT. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to define immune cell infiltration. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of total, helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and CD3<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> natural killer (NK)-cell count (p = 0.20; p = 0.12; p = 0.76; p = 0.75, respectively).According to KBx findings prior to ERT, all patients had interstitial fibrosis (IF), podocyte vacuoles (PV), and podocyte inclusion (PI), CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, and CD56 positivity at different levels. None of the patients had CD19, CD20, and CD138 positivity at the first biopsies. When we compared the first and the second KBx results of the two progressors, we also demonstrated that CD3<sup>+</sup>4<sup>+</sup>T-cells infiltration remained the same, whereas CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, CD16<sup>+</sup> and 56<sup>+</sup>NK-cells infiltration were significantly decreased.

    "abstract": "HomeCageScan (HCS) is an automated behavioral scoring system that can be used to classify and quantify rodent behaviors in the home cage. Although HCS has been used for a number of inducible models of severe pain, little has been done to test this system in clinically relevant genetic disease models associated with chronic pain such as Fabry disease. Rats with Fabry disease exhibit mechanical hypersensitivity, however, it is unclear if these rodents also exhibit ongoing non-evoked pain. Therefore, we analyzed HCS data from male and female rats with Fabry disease. Using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, we found both sex and genotype differences in several home cage behaviors. Additionally, we used hierarchical clustering to derive behavioral clusters in an unbiased manner. Analysis of these behavioral clusters showed that primarily female Fabry animals moved less, spent less time caring for themselves (e.g., less time spent grooming and drinking), explored less, and slept more; changes that are similar to lifestyle changes observed in patients with long lasting chronic pain. We also show that sniffing, one of the exploratory behaviors that is depressed in Fabry animals, can be partly restored with the analgesic gabapentin, suggesting that depressed sniffing may reflect ongoing pain. Therefore, this approach to HCS data analysis can be used to assess drug efficacy in Fabry disease and potentially other genetic and inducible rodent models associated with persistent pain."

FLT190, an investigational gene therapy, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with Fabry disease (NCT04040049). FLT190 consists of a potent, synthetic capsid (AAVS3) containing an expression cassette with a codon-optimized human GLA cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter FRE1 (AAV2/S3-FRE1-GLAco). For mouse studies FLT190 genome was pseudotyped with AAV8 for efficient transduction. Preclinical studies in a murine model of Fabry disease (Gla-deficient mice), and non-human primates (NHPs) showed dose-dependent increases in plasma α-Gal A with steady-state observed 2 weeks following a single intravenous dose. In Fabry mice, AAV8-FLT190 treatment resulted in clearance of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in plasma, urine, kidney, and heart; electron microscopy analyses confirmed reductions in storage inclusion bodies in kidney and heart. In NHPs, α-Gal A expression was consistent with the levels of hGLA mRNA in liver, and no FLT190-related toxicities or adverse events were observed. Taken together, these studies demonstrate preclinical proof-of-concept of liver-directed gene therapy with FLT190 for the treatment of Fabry disease."

To clarify the influence of plasma Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 in a symptomatic <i>Gla</i> <sup><i>tm</i></sup> <i>Tg(CAG-A4GALT)</i> FD mouse model, the total contents of Gb3, lyso-Gb3 and their analogs in various organs and plasma were determined in mice with early- (5-week-old) and late-stage (20-week-old) renal dysfunction. A marked increase in total Gb3 content in the heart, kidneys, spleen, liver, small intestine, lungs, brain, and plasma was observed in the 20-week-old mice compared to that in 5-week-old mice. In contrast, the increase in lyso-Gb3 was relatively small, and the total content in the lungs and plasma was unchanged. Lyso-Gb3 analogs {lyso-Gb3(-2) and lyso-Gb3(+18)} and Gb3 analogs {Gb3(-2) and Gb3(+18)} were observed in all organs and plasma at both ages, and the percentages of the analogs were unique to specific organs. The pattern of 37 Gb3 analogs/isoforms of liver Gb3 corresponded well with that of plasma Gb3. Although the analog pattern of plasma lyso-Gb3 did not resemble that of any organ lyso-Gb3, the relative content {lyso-Gb3: lyso-Gb3(-2)} in the sum of all organs corresponded well to that of the plasma at both ages. These data indicate that liver Gb3 may contribute to the plasma Gb3 level, while plasma lyso-Gb3 may be released from all organs, and the capacity of the plasma lyso-Gb3 pool may reach a maximum at an early stage of renal dysfunction."

Although increased knowledge has shown that females often develop the disease, data from Spain and other countries reported that females were undertreated. The aim of this study was to provide a wider and more recent description of the disease characteristics and associated management of females with a GLA variant in a Spanish cohort. Ninety-seven females from 12 hospitals were included in this retrospective study. Mean age was 50.1 ± 17.2 years. Median follow-up time from GLA variant identification was 36.1 months, and most (70.1%) were identified through family screening. Variants associated with classic/non-classic phenotypes were similarly distributed (40.2%/53.6%). Missense variants were the most prevalent (n = 84, 86.6%). In the overall group, 70.4% had major organ involvement (i.e., cardiac, renal, cerebrovascular, peripheral nervous system or gastrointestinal), and 47.3% also had typical Fabry signs (angiokeratoma, cornea verticillata or increased plasma lyso-Gb3). Cardiac involvement was the most prevalent (49.5%) and the main reason for treatment initiation. A total of 33 (34%) patients received disease-specific therapy, 55% of whom were diagnosed by family screening. Females carrying variants associated with a classic phenotype had higher frequencies of clinical manifestations (92.3%) and were predominant in the treated subgroup (69.7%). Despite this, there were 34 untreated females (56.7% of total untreated), with both phenotypes represented, who had major organ involvement, with 27 of cardiac, renal or cerebrovascular nature. Age or comorbidities in this subgroup were comparable to the treated subgroup (P = 0.8 and P = 0.8, respectively). Efforts have been made in recent years to diagnose and treat timely Fabry females in Spain. A high percentage of females with pathogenic variants, regardless of their associated phenotype, will likely develop disease. A proportion of females with severe disease in this cohort received specific treatment. Still a significant number of females, even with same profile as the treated ones, who may be eligible for treatment according to European recommendations, remained untreated. Reasons for this merit further investigation."

We retrospectively evaluated the association between RV-FWS and the occurrence of cardiovascular events in a cohort of 56 patients with FD. The study endpoint comprises cardiovascular mortality, severe heart failure symptoms, new-onset atrial fibrillation and major arrhythmias requiring device implantation. Reduced RV-FWS, defined by values lower than 23%, was found in 25 (45%) patients. During a median follow-up of 47 months, 16 (29%) patients met the study endpoint. A ROC-curve analysis confirmed the threshold of reduced RV-FWS (<23%) as the best cut-off for predicting cardiovascular events, but with a lower power compared to left-sided parameters. On univariable Cox regression analysis, RV-FWS, expressed as continuous variable, was significantly associated with the study endpoint (HR: 0.795, 95% CI: 0.710-0.889, p < 0.001). However, RV-FWS did not retain a significant association with outcomes, after adjustment for LV global longitudinal strain or indexed left atrial volume (p = 0.340 and p = 0.289 respectively). RV-FWS was not independently associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events in FD, confirming previous observations that prognosis is mainly driven by the severity of LV cardiomyopathy."

Of 266 enrolled patients, 105 (39.5%) had LVH (age 58.5±11.9 years, 48.6% men), and 11 (10.5%) had LVAA. Over 49.3±34.8 months of follow-up, 25 patients with LVH experienced composite events, including 9 heart failure hospitalizations, 4 sustained ventricular tachycardia, 6 ischemic strokes, and 15 mortalities. In patients with LVH, those with LVAA had a significantly higher risk of composite events and lower event-free survival than those without LVAA (8 [72.7%] versus 17 [18.1%], log-rank <i>P</i><0.001). LVAA was independently associated with an increased risk of composite events (hazard ratio, 3.59 [95% CI, 1.30-9.91]; <i>P</i>=0.01) after adjusting for age, sex, advanced heart failure, renal function, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular diastolic function, and left ventricular mass index. Conclusions LVAA is present in approximately 10% of patients with Fabry disease and LVH. It is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events and may necessitate aggressive treatment."

    "title": "Genetic causes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: emerging pharmacological treatments.",
    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major driver of cardiac morbidity and mortality in developed countries, due to ageing populations and the increasing prevalence of comorbidities. While heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is dominated by left ventricular impairment, HFpEF results from a complex interplay of cardiac remodelling, peripheral circulation, and concomitant features including age, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. In an important subset, however, HFpEF is subtended by specific diseases of the myocardium that are genetically determined, have distinct pathophysiology, and are increasingly amenable to targeted, innovative treatments. While each of these conditions is rare, they collectively represent a relevant subset within HFpEF cohorts, and their prompt recognition has major consequences for clinical practice, as access to dedicated, disease-specific treatments may radically change the quality of life and outcome. Furthermore, response to standard heart failure treatment will generally be modest for these individuals, whose inclusion in registries and trials may dilute the perceived efficacy of treatments targeting mainstream HFpEF. Finally, a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of monogenic myocardial disease may help identify therapeutic targets and develop innovative treatments for selected HFpEF phenotypes of broader epidemiological relevance. The field of genetic cardiomyopathies is undergoing rapid transformation due to recent, groundbreaking advances in drug development, and deserves greater awareness within the heart failure community. The present review addressed existing and developing therapies for genetic causes of HFpEF, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and storage diseases, discussing their potential impact on management and their broader implications for our understanding of HFpEF at large."

    "abstract": "Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are not just a matter of scarring or inflammation in the lung tissue. The lungs can also serve as a repository for products that can be produced in excessive amounts in the human body as a result of disease. Geneticaly based dysfunctions of lysosomal enzymes, which leads to an unefficient degradation and transport of various macromolecules from lysosomes, are considered to be storage diseases sensu stricto. ILDs were described in patients with Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease and Fabry disease. In a broader context, however, the accumulation of various substances in the lung tissue is also encountered in cases of pediatric pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (PIG), alveolar lipoproteinosis or pulmonary amyloidosis. The cause of PIG is not clear. The disease was first described in 2002 and a lung tissue sample is required to establish this diagnosis. Even though PIG usually goes well in childhood and the patients difficulties spontaneously subside over time, the long-term prognosis of the patients is unknown. Alveolar lipoproteinoses can be acquired (e.g. after massive exposure to silica dust), autoimmune, but also genetically determined. Unlike lysosomal storage diseases, in the case of pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis, accumulation of abnormal macromolecules occurs only in the lungs of affected individuals. Similarly, amyloidosis is not a single disease, but a group of diseases with different etiopathogenesis, as a result of which amyloid - a group of different proteins with a distinctvive conformation, which can be deposited in various organs, including the lungs - is formed. The diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis is based on the typical appearance and biochemical composition of the fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, the diagnosis of amyloidosis is histological."

However, such screening has not been conducted in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Herein, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing hemodialysis in Chiba Prefecture by high-risk screening using α-galactosidase A (αGal A) activity measurement, and examine the hemodialysis effect on αGal A activity. Patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at 25 facilities in Chiba Prefecture were recruited. The αGal A activity was measured using the dried blood spot (DBS) test as the first screening. If the enzyme activity was lower than the cut-off, the second screening was performed with the same method before and after dialysis. Overall, 2924 patients (2036 men and 888 women) were included from which 94 cases (45 men and 48 women) showed decreased αGAL activity in the first screening and 3 (two men and one women) in the second screening. Genetic testing was performed in 3 patients, and the c.1078G > A mutation in GLA gene was detected in one male patient (0.03%). There has been a statistically significant decrease in αGal A activity of DBS at post-dialysis compared to that at pre-dialysis (20.5 ± 10.4 pmol/h/disk and 22.7 ± 11.5 pmol/h/disk, p < 0.0001). The prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing hemodialysis in Chiba Prefecture was estimated as 0.03%. This is the first time that dialysis has been shown to affect the αGal A activity."

Cardiovascular involvement in classic and late onset forms has emerged to be a major determinant of prognosis. In recent years, a constant evolution in imaging techniques and their mindful application has led to interesting results in the diagnostic workup, progressively reducing time required to recognize early signs of this disease. Owing to the growing awareness for diagnostic screening and the efficacy of the many therapeutic options currently available, the clinical history of Fabry patients has changed during the last decades.

The effects of dose escalation on ADA titer and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>) level are unknown. We screened 250 FD patients (200 males, 50 females) under ERT for ADAs and assessed the impact of an approved dose escalation in affected patients, focusing on ADA titers and plasma lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>. ADA-positive patients were identified by serum-mediated inhibition assays, followed by titration assays to determine the individual inhibitory capacities of ADAs against agalsidase-alfa and agalsidase-beta. 70 (35%) of the male patients were ADA-positive, with a mean inhibitory capacity of 83.5 ± 113.7mg AGAL. Although patients receiving agalsidase-beta showed higher inhibitory capacities (84.7 ± 34.7mg) than patients under agalsidase-alfa (60.3 ± 126.7mg, p<0.001), the \"theoretical deficit\" to the infused dose was lower in patients receiving agalsidase-beta. In seven patients receiving agalsidase-alfa (0.2 mg/kg) ADAs were saturable by switching patients to agalsidase-beta (1.0 mg/kg). The switch resulted in increasing ADA titers within the first months. In 2 out of 7 (28.6%) therapy switchers, dose escalation could lead to durable ADA saturation. Independent of an increase in ADA titers, lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> levels decrease and cardiac and renal parameters remained stable after dose escalation. Dose escalation results in a heterogeneous, unpredictable ADA response, with more than a quarter of all treatment switchers succeeding in ADA saturation. Longitudinal ADA measurements are required to assess the individual risk of affected patients."

However, the relative risks of auditory deficits among patients with Fabry disease relative to the general population without a diagnosis of Fabry disease have not been studied. This study aims to explore the associations between Fabry disease and hearing-related manifestations using a nationwide population-based dataset. We identified study patients for this cross-sectional study from the 2015−2017 claims databases of the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. We first identified 2312 patients aged over 20 years with a diagnosis of Fabry disease. We used propensity score matching to select five comparison patients per patient with Fabry disease and 11,560 comparison patients without Fabry disease. We used multivariable logistic regressions to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for tinnitus, hearing loss, and sudden deafness among Fabry disease patients vs. comparison patients. Chi-square tests showed statistically significant differences between patients with and without Fabry disease in the prevalence rates of tinnitus (16.7% vs. 11.7%, p < 0.001), hearing loss (7.5% vs. 6.2%, p = 0.014) and sudden deafness (1.7% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.005). Multiple logistic regression revealed that patients with Fabry disease were more likely to suffer from tinnitus, hearing loss and sudden deafness, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.513 (95% CI = 1.336−1.713), 1.246 (95% CI = 1.047−1.483), and 1.681 (95% CI = 1.166−2.423), respectively.

Research in this area has largely focused on the cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease, and very little has been described about further neurological manifestations, which are known in other lysosomal diseases, such as Gaucher disease. In particular, a clinical and neuroimaging phenotype suggesting neurodegeneration as a putative mechanism has never been fully described for AFD, but the increased survival of affected patients with early diagnosis and the possibility of treatment have given rise to some isolated reports in the literature on the association of AFD with a clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease (PD). The data are currently scarce, but it is possible to hypothesize the molecular mechanisms of cell damage that support this association; this topic is worthy of further study in particular in relation to the therapeutic possibilities, which have significantly modified the natural history of the disease but which are not specifically dedicated to the CNS.

We aimed to screen for FD a case series of PD patients from Southern Italy and to review the literature. One hundred and forty-four consecutive unrelated PD subjects were enrolled. The α-GAL activity was measured in all men and, in case of pathological values, subsequent determination of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and GLA gene sequencing were also performed. All the women underwent GLA gene sequencing. α-GAL levels resulted low in fifteen men, whereas lyso-Gb3 testing showed values within the reference range in all of them. GLA gene variants were not detected in any tested subjects. One pathological study, six case series, and five case reports are currently reported in literature. The few studies reviewed are heterogeneous, and the results are controversial. An unknown significance variant in GLA gene was detected in PD patients in one large study, whereas decreased α-GAL activity was observed in PD subjects in two other researches, but without confirmation by lyso-Gb3 assessment or genetic analysis. Vascular parkinsonism was associated to FD in five case reports. We found no association between PD and FD in our population. However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions due to limited sample size. Furthermore, controls would have been missing in case of a positive finding."

The incidence rate of FACEs was 48.3 events per 1000 patient-years overall. Numerically higher incidence rates were observed in men versus women, patients aged >40 years versus younger patients, ERT-naïve versus ERT-experienced patients and men with the classic phenotype versus men and women with all other phenotypes. There was no statistically significant difference in time to first FACE when analysed by patient sex, phenotype, prior treatment status or age. Lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was associated with an increased risk of FACEs across patient populations. The overall incidence of FACEs for patients during long-term treatment with migalastat compared favourably with historic reports involving ERT. Lower baseline eGFR was a significant predictor of FACEs."

CMR represents the gold standard for assessing volumes, function, biventricular kinetics and providing tissue characterization through scans with and without contrast medium. In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, CMR allows to search for viability, accurately estimate volumes and ejection fraction. It can assess scar extent for predicting response to cardiac resynchronization therapy and for establishing an indication for implanting a defibrillator in borderline cases. In patients with HFrEF and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, CMR helps to identify specific etiological subgroups and to estimate the arrhythmic risk beyond ejection fraction. In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, CMR offers the possibility of diagnosing specific phenotypes, including sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloidosis or Fabry disease, and adds prognostic information. Both clinical and scientific interest in this imaging method is constantly expanding; the clinicians dealing with heart failure cannot fail to know the technique, the indications and all the potential that CMR can offer."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked disease due to a multiverse of disrupting mutations within the GLA gene encoding lysosomal α-galactosidase A (AGAL). Absent AGAL activity causes the accumulation of complex glycosphingolipids inside of lysosomes in a variety of cell types and results in a progressive multisystem disease. Known disease-associated point mutations in protein-coding gene regions usually cause translational perturbations and result in premature chain termination, punctual amino acid sequence alterations or overall altered sequence alterations downstream of the mutation site. However, nucleotide exchanges at the border between introns and exons can affect splicing behavior and lead to abnormal pre-mRNA processing. Prediction with the Human Splicing Finder (HSF) revealed an indication of a significant change in splicing-relevant information for some known FD-associated GLA mutations. To experimentally determine the extent of the change, we made use of a minigene reporter assay and verified alternative splicing events for the exonic mutations c.194G>T and c.358C>G, which led to the usage of alternative donor splice sites at exon 1 and exon 2, respectively. In addition, the mutations c.548G>T and c.638A>T led to significant exon 4 skipping. We conclude that splicing phenotype analysis should be employed in the in vitro analysis of exonic GLA gene mutations, since abnormal splicing may result in a reduction of enzyme activity and alter the amenability for treatment with pharmacological chaperone (PC)."

Finally, we found that the sample size, etiology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet strength, study type, and study quality contributed to interstudy heterogeneity. Lower FA or higher MD/ADC values were related to more severe cognitive impairment. General cognition and executive function domains attracted the greatest interest. The FL was commonly examined and strongly associated with general cognition, executive function, and attention. The CC was strongly associated with memory and attention. The CG was strongly related to general cognition and attention. The CR, IC, and TR were also strongly related to general cognition. Indeed, these results should be validated in high-quality prospective studies with larger sample sizes. http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, identifier: CRD42021226133."

    "abstract": "Venglustat inhibits the enzymatic conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide, reducing available substrate for the synthesis of more complex glycosphingolipids. It offers a potential new approach to the treatment of patients with Fabry disease (α-Gal A deficiency), in whom progressive accumulation of such glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), in the lysosomes of a wide range of cell types often leads to vital organ complications in adulthood. An international, open-label, single-arm, Phase 2a uncontrolled 26-week clinical study (NCT02228460) and a 130-week extension study (NCT02489344) were conducted to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of 15 mg once daily oral venglustat in treatment-naïve adult male patients with classic Fabry disease. Of 11 patients (18-37 years old) who initially enrolled, nine completed the 26-week study and seven completed the extension study. A total of 169 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by nine patients, the majority being mild (73%) and unrelated to the study drug (70%). Nine serious TEAEs (serious adverse events) and 11 severe TEAEs, including a self-harm event, were reported. No deaths or treatment-related life-threatening adverse events were reported. Skin GL-3 scores in superficial skin capillary endothelium (SSCE), estimated by light microscopy, were unchanged from baseline at Week 26 in five patients, decreased in three patients, and increased in one patient. There was no significant change in GL-3 scores or significant shift in grouped GL-3 scores. Five of six patients had reductions from baseline in GL-3 score at the end of the extension study. At Weeks 26 and 156 the mean (standard deviation) changes from baseline in the fraction of the volume of SSCE cytoplasm occupied by GL-3 inclusions, measured by electron microscopy unbiased stereology, were - 0.06 (0.03) (p = 0.0010) and - 0.12 (0.04) (p = 0.0008), respectively. Venglustat treatment reduced markers in the synthetic and degradative pathway of major glycosphingolipids; proximal markers reduced rapidly and more distal markers (plasma GL-3 and globotriaosylsphingosine) reduced progressively. There were no biochemical or histological indications of progression of Fabry disease over 3 years of follow-up. These findings confirm target engagement and the pharmacodynamic effects of venglustat in adult males with classic Fabry disease. However, further clinical evaluation in larger studies is needed to determine efficacy and safety."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD), also known as Anderson-Fabry disease, is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency or reduced activity of alpha-galactosidase A enzyme, which results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in the cells. Atypical (late-onset) FD is characterized by the preserved residual activity of alpha-galactosidase A enzyme resulting in a later presentation in life than classic FD. Patients with late-onset FD are usually present in their third to seventh decades of life with the heart being the most commonly affected organ. FD can also affect the renal and gastrointestinal (GI) systems, however, in the literature, FD limited to the kidneys is scarcely reported and there is no data to suggest disease involvement of the liver. We present a rare case of late-onset FD affecting the kidneys and liver without cardiac or other organ involvement in a patient without having a family history of FD."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is an X-linked inherited lysosomal disease caused by a defect in the gene encoding lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (GLA). Atrio-ventricular (AV) nodal conduction defects and sinus node dysfunction are common complications of the disease. It is not fully elucidated how frequently AFD is responsible for acquired AV block or sinus node dysfunction and if some AFD patients could manifest primarily with spontaneous bradycardia in general population. The purpose of study was to evaluate the prevalence of AFD in male patients with implanted permanent pacemaker (PM). The prospective multicentric screening in consecutive male patients between 35 and 65 years with implanted PM for acquired third- or second- degree type 2 AV block or symptomatic second- degree type 1 AV block or sinus node dysfunction was performed. A total of 484 patients (mean age 54 ± 12 years at time of PM implantation) were enrolled to the screening in 12 local sites in Czech Republic. Out of all patients, negative result was found in 481 (99%) subjects. In 3 cases, a GLA variant was found, classified as benign: p.Asp313Tyr, p.D313Y). Pathogenic GLA variants (classical or non-classical form) or variants of unclear significance were not detected. The prevalence of pathogenic variants causing AFD in a general population sample with implanted permanent PM for AV conduction defects or sinus node dysfunction seems to be low. Our findings do not advocate a routine screening for AFD in all adult males with clinically significant bradycardia."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an inherited metabolic disorder with various symptoms. Neurological manifestations are small fiber neuropathy, cerebral white matter lesions (WML), megadolicho basilar artery, and stroke. The relevance of the D313Y variant in the galactosidase alpha gene is controversially discussed. We aimed at elucidating the implications of this differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), focussing on the analysis of WML over time and correlations with other markers. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging data of 21 carriers of the D313Y variant at a single German outpatient clinic for MS between 2004 and 2021. In our cohort (15 females, 6 males), mean age at diagnosis was 44.1 ± 16.3 years, and mean follow-up duration was 3.1 ± 3.9 years. WML were rated on both, the Fazekas scale and the age-related white matter changes rating scale, and were of variable interindividual extent. Follow-up imaging showed virtually no progress. WML did not correlate with the severity of clinical findings or lysoGb3 levels. Symptomatic carriers of the variant are characterized by an almost complete lack of internal organ manifestations and laboratory findings, usually associated with Fabry disease. WML in carriers of the D313Y variant do not seem to be suitable for assessing or predicting the (para-) clinical status. Concerning MS patients, the variant and its clinical signs can be a differential diagnosis, but also a co-factor. Imaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings facilitate the distinction between both entities."

    "abstract": "T1 mapping provides valuable information regarding cardiomyopathies. Manual drawing is time consuming and prone to subjective errors. Therefore, this study aimed to test a DL algorithm for the automated measurement of native T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) fractions in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with a temporally separated dataset. CMR images obtained for 95 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 54.5 ± 15.2 years), including 36 left ventricular hypertrophy (12 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 12 Fabry disease, and 12 amyloidosis), 32 dilated cardiomyopathy, and 27 healthy volunteers, were included. A commercial deep learning (DL) algorithm based on 2D U-net (Myomics-T1 software, version 1.0.0) was used for the automated analysis of T1 maps. Four radiologists, as study readers, performed manual analysis. The reference standard was the consensus result of the manual analysis by two additional expert readers. The segmentation performance of the DL algorithm and the correlation and agreement between the automated measurement and the reference standard were assessed. Interobserver agreement among the four radiologists was analyzed. DL successfully segmented the myocardium in 99.3% of slices in the native T1 map and 89.8% of slices in the post-T1 map with Dice similarity coefficients of 0.86 ± 0.05 and 0.74 ± 0.17, respectively. Native T1 and ECV showed strong correlation and agreement between DL and the reference: for T1, <i>r</i> = 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.951-0.978) and bias of 9.5 msec (95% limits of agreement [LOA], -23.6-42.6 msec); for ECV, <i>r</i> = 0.987 (95% CI, 0.980-0.991) and bias of 0.7% (95% LOA, -2.8%-4.2%) on per-subject basis. Agreements between DL and each of the four radiologists were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.98-0.99 for both native T1 and ECV), comparable to the pairwise agreement between the radiologists (ICC of 0.97-1.00 and 0.99-1.00 for native T1 and ECV, respectively). The DL algorithm allowed automated T1 and ECV measurements comparable to those of radiologists."

    "abstract": "<i>Alpha galactosidase A</i> (<i>α-GalA</i>) gene contains nine exons localized at the q-arm of the X chromosome. Generally, an α-GalA enzyme is involved in the removal of galactosyl moieties from the glycoproteins and glycolipids. Dysregulation results in the accumulation of glycoproteins as well as glycolipids in various organs leading to Fabry disease (FD). In this study, we examine the impact of Asn215Ser, Ala143Thr and Arg112Cys variants on the α-GalA protein structure contributing to functional dynamic changes in FD. The seven computational pathogenicity prediction methods were used to predict the effects of these variants on the α-GalA protein. The three-dimensional structure of α-GalA variants was modeled with the Swiss Model and Robetta server and validated using a variety of tools. Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to understand the stability and dynamic behavior of the wild-type and variants structures. Most of our analyzed pathogenicity prediction tools showed that Asn215Ser, Ala143Thr and Arg112Cys variants cause a deleterious effect on the α-GalA protein. Further, MD trajectory analysis showed the destabilizing effect of variants on α-GalA structure based on the root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, solvent accessible surface area, the radius of gyration, hydrogen bond, cluster analysis and PCA analysis. This concludes that the presence of these variants could potentially affect the protein functional process of galactosyl moieties removal which might lead to Fabry disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The disturbed catabolism of the neutral sphingolipids globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) leads to its progressive lysosomal accumulation throughout the body. Multiple organs can be affected. The atypical late-onset cardiac variant is associated with a high burden of cardiac morbidity and mortality. The aim of this work was to present an updated overview of the FD, with focus on cardiovascular manifestations and its management. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is nowadays an established treatment of FD and is recommended as early as possible with or without chaperone therapy (migalastat) to prevent or delay the progression of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications. It improves quality of life and may further result in decrease in Left ventricular (LV) mass and to some extent LV function recovery. However, LV hypertrophy (LVH) does not always respond well to ERT despite successful Gb3 clearance. Furthermore, its impact on the hard clinical events is uncertain. Some possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy are discussed. ERT may be less effective in patients who have already developed fibrosis or irreversible organ damage. However, other confounding factors may be equally important."

We analyzed an exome-based gene panel of 349 genes in 172 clinically well-characterized patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven, juvenile (age ≤ 55 years), ischemic stroke admitted to a single comprehensive stroke center. Monogenetic diseases causing ischemic stroke were observed in five patients (2.9%): In three patients with lacunar stroke (1.7%), we identified pathogenic variants in NOTCH3 causing cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Hence, CADASIL was identified at a frequency of 12.5% in the lacunar stroke subgroup. Further, in two male patients (1.2%) suffering from lacunar and cardioembolic stroke, pathogenic variants in GLA causing Fabry's disease were present. Additionally, genetic variants in monogenetic diseases lacking impact on stroke occurrence, variants of unclear significance (VUS) in monogenetic diseases, and (cardiovascular-) risk genes in ischemic stroke were observed in a total of 15 patients (15.7%).

    "abstract": "Protein based therapeutics have successfully improved the quality of life for patients of monogenic disorders like hemophilia, Pompe and Fabry disease. However, a significant proportion of patients develop immune responses towards intravenously infused therapeutic protein, which can complicate or neutralize treatment and compromise patient safety. Strategies aimed at circumventing immune responses following therapeutic protein infusion can greatly improve therapeutic efficacy. In recent years, antigen-based oral tolerance induction has shown promising results in the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases, food allergies and can prevent anti-drug antibody formation to protein replacement therapies. Oral tolerance exploits regulatory mechanisms that are initiated in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to promote active suppression of orally ingested antigen. In this review, we outline general perceptions and current knowledge about the mechanisms of oral tolerance, including tissue specific sites of tolerance induction and the cells involved, with emphasis on antigen presenting cells and regulatory T cells. We define several factors, such as cytokines and metabolites that impact the stability and expansion potential of these immune modulatory cells. We highlight preclinical studies that have been performed to induce oral tolerance to therapeutic proteins or enzymes for single gene disorders, such as hemophilia or Pompe disease. These studies mainly utilize a transgenic plant-based system for oral delivery of antigen in conjugation with fusion protein technology that favors the prevention of antigen degradation in the stomach while enhancing uptake in the small intestine by antigen presenting cells and regulatory T cell induction, thereby promoting antigen specific systemic tolerance."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. It is associated with physical distress and social challenges that may affect adults differently compared to pediatric patients. However, there is no disease-specific quality of life (QOL) scale that can provide a detailed assessment of QOL for adults with Fabry disease. Therefore, we aimed to determine the factor structure and assess the validity of a scale that was created to assess the QOL of adult patients with Fabry disease. This study was conducted in two phases. First, scale feasibility was confirmed through a questionnaire survey of nine patients. Second, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of patients (aged ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with Fabry disease was conducted. Item development and refinement were conducted based on guidelines for scale development. Exploratory factor analysis was used to clarify the factor structure and confirm internal consistency. As a measure of QOL, construct validity was of the scale was verified based on its correlations with the Short Form-8 (SF-8) scale. The newly created Adult Fabry Disease QOL (AFQOL) scale comprises 39 items that cover five factors: \"neuropathic pain and abdominal symptoms,\" \"impact on work and school,\" \"relationship challenges,\" \"ophthalmologic and otolaryngologic symptoms,\" and \"cardiovascular and renal symptoms.\" Cronbach's alpha coefficient for all factors was above 0.8, and the AFQOL total scores were significantly correlated with the physical and mental components of the SF-8 (rs = - 0.508 and - 0.400, respectively). The AFQOL scale assesses physical symptoms and social difficulties experienced by adult patients with Fabry disease. A strength of the scale is its ability to assess the impact of work and relationships on patients. The scale can be useful in objectively assessing QOL for a group or for individual patients. Future research should explore further aspects of the scale's validity and reliability."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a monogenic disease characterized by a deficiency or loss of the α-galactosidase A (GLA). The resulting impairment in lysosomal GLA enzymatic activity leads to the pathogenic accumulation of enzymatic substrate and, consequently, the progressive appearance of clinical symptoms in target organs, including the heart, kidney, and brain. However, the mechanisms involved in Fabry disease-mediated organ damage are largely ambiguous and poorly understood, which hinders the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disorder. Although currently available clinical approaches have shown some efficiency in the treatment of Fabry disease, they all exhibit limitations that need to be overcome. In this review, we first introduce current mechanistic knowledge of Fabry disease and discuss potential therapeutic strategies for its treatment. We then systemically summarize and discuss advances in research on therapeutic approaches, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), gene therapy, and chaperone therapy, as well as strategies targeting subcellular compartments, such as lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the nucleus. Finally, the future development of potential therapeutic strategies is discussed based on the results of mechanistic studies and the limitations associated with these therapeutic approaches."

Noteworthy features of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) include facial features such as prominent brows, wide noses, thickened lips, mouth, and chin, resulting in coarse and rounded facial features. We evaluated and report the prevalence of facial phenotypes in patients with different LSDs, noting two current examples when artificial intelligence strategies have been utilized to identify distinctive facies. Specific LSDs, including Gaucher disease, Mucolipidosis IV and Fabry disease have recently been distinguished using facial recognition software. Additional lysosomal disorders LSDs lysosomal storage disorders with unique and distinguishable facial features also merit evaluation using this technology.

In the present study we present the molecular and biochemical data of the Danish Fabry cohort and report 20 years' (2001-2020) experience in cascade genetic screening at the Danish National Fabry Disease Center. The Danish Fabry cohort consisted of 26 families, 18 index patients (9 males and 9 females, no available data for 8 index-patients) and 97 family members with a pathogenic GLA variant identified by cascade genetic testing (30 males and 67 females). Fourteen patients (5 males and 9 females; mean age of death 47.0 and 64.8 years respectively) died during follow-up. The completeness of the Fabry patient identification in the country has resulted in a cohort of balanced genotypes according to gender (twice number of females compared to males), indicating that the cohort was not biased by referral, and further resulted in earlier diagnosis of the disease by a lower age at diagnosis in family members compared to index-patients (mean age at diagnosis: index-patients 42.2 vs. family members 26.0 years).

    "abstract": "The diagnostic paths of hereditary cardiomyopathies (CMPs) include both clinical and molecular genetics. The first step is the clinical diagnosis that guides the decisions about treatments, monitoring, prognostic stratification, and prevention of major events. The type of CMP [hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)] is defined by the phenotype, and the genetic testing may identify the precise cause. Furthermore, genetic testing provides a pre-clinical diagnosis in unaffected family members and the basis for prenatal diagnosis. It can contribute to risk stratification (e.g. LMNA) and can be a major diagnostic criterion (e.g. ARVC). The test can be limited to a single gene when the pre-test diagnostic hypothesis is based on proven clinical evidence (e.g. GLA for Fabry disease). Alternatively, it can be expanded from a multigene panel to a whole exome or whole genome sequencing when the pre-test hypothesis is a genetically heterogeneous disease. In the last decade, the study of larger genomic targets led to the identification of numerous gene variants not only pathogenic (clinically actionable) but also of uncertain clinical significance (not actionable). For the latter, the pillar of the genetic diagnosis is the correct interpretation of the pathogenicity of genetic variants, which is evaluated using both bioinformatics and clinical-genetic criteria about the patient and family. In this context, cardiologists play a central role in the interpretation of genetic tests, performing the deep-phenotyping of variant carriers and establishing the co-segregation of the genotype with the phenotype in families."

    "abstract": "Recently, a new mechanism of drug-drug interaction (DDI) was reported between agalsidase, a therapeutic protein, and migalastat, a small molecule, both of which are treatment options of Fabry disease. Migalastat is a pharmacological chaperone that stabilizes the native form of both endogenous and exogenous agalsidase. In Fabry patients co-administrated with agalsidase and migalastat, the increase in active agalsidase exposure is considered a pharmacokinetic effect of agalsidase infusion but a pharmacodynamic effect of migalastat administration, which makes this new DDI mechanism even more interesting. To quantitatively characterize the interaction between agalsidase and migalastat in human, a pharmacometric DDI model was developed using literature reported concentration-time data. The final model includes three components: a 1-compartment linear model component for migalastat; a 2-compartment linear model component for agalsidase; and a DDI component where the agalsidase-migalastat complex is formed via second order association constant k<sub>on</sub>, dissociated with first order dissociation constant k<sub>off</sub>, and distributed/eliminated with same rates as agalsidase alone, albeit the complex (i.e., bound agalsidase) has higher enzyme activity compared to free agalsidase. The final model adequately captured several key features of the unique interaction between agalsidase and migalastat, and successfully characterized the kinetics of migalastat as well as the kinetics and activities of agalsidase when both drugs were used alone or in combination following different doses. Most parameters were reasonably estimated with good precision. Because the model includes mechanistic basis of therapeutic protein and small molecule pharmacological chaperone interaction, it can potentially serve as a foundational work for DDIs with similar mechanism."

Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is useful in the diagnosis/management of RCDs, as it performs angiography, function, perfusion, and tissue characterization in the same examination. Edema expressed as a high signal in STIRT2 or increased T2 mapping is common in acute/active inflammatory states. Diffuse subendocardial fibrosis, expressed as diffuse late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), is characteristic of microvascular disease as in systemic sclerosis, small vessel vasculitis, cardiac amyloidosis, and metabolic disorders. Replacement fibrosis, expressed as LGE, in the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle (LV) is typical of neuromuscular disorders. Patchy LGE with concurrent edema is typical of myocarditis, irrespective of the cause. Cardiac hypertrophy is characteristic in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and Anderson-Fabry Disease (AFD), but LGE is located in the IVS, subendocardium and lateral wall in HCM, CA and AFD, respectively. Native T1 mapping is increased in HCM and CA and reduced in AFD. Magnetic resonance angiography provides information on aortopathies, such as Marfan, Turner syndrome and Takayasu vasculitis. LGE in the right ventricle is the typical finding of ARVC, but it may involve LV, leading to the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Tissue changes in RCDs may be detected only through parametric imaging indices."

FD cardiomyopathy is characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and should be considered in differential diagnosis with all the other causes of LV hypertrophy. An early diagnosis of FD is very important because the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may change the fate of patients by blocking both cardiac and systemic involvement and improving prognosis. Diagnosis may be relatively easy in young patients with the typical signs and symptoms of FD, but in male patients with late onset of disease and in females, diagnosis may be very challenging. Morphological and functional aspects are not specific to FD, which cannot be diagnosed or excluded by echocardiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with tissue characterization capability is an accurate technique for the differential diagnosis of LV hypertrophy. The finding of decreased myocardial T1 value in LV hypertrophy is specific to FD. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is found in the late stage of the disease, but it is useful to predict the cardiac response to ERT and to stratify the prognosis."

    "abstract": "Anderson-Fabry Disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by mutations in <i>GLA,</i> the gene encoding the lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), leading to accumulation of glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes. FD is a multisystemic disorder leading to progressive cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney dysfunction. Phenotypes are divided in two main classes, classic or non-classic, depending on substrate accumulation, age at onset, disease manifestation, severity and progression. The more severe classical phenotype is generally associated with mutations leading to absent or strongly reduced α-Gal A activity, while mutations with higher residual activity generally lead to the non-classical one. Approximately 70% of the over 1,000 Fabry disease-associated mutations are missense mutations, some leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of mutant protein. We hypothesized that such mutations could be associated, besides the well-known absence of α-Gal A function/activity, to a possible gain of function effect due to production of a misfolded protein. We hence expressed α-Gal A missense mutations in HEK293 <i>GLA</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> cells and investigated the localization of mutant protein and induction of ER stress and of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We selected a panel of 7 missense mutations, including mutants shown to have residual or no activity <i>in vitro</i>. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that mutants with residual activity have decreased lysosomal localization compared with wild type, and partial retention in the ER, while missense mutants with no residual activity are fully retained in the ER. UPR (ATF6 branch) was significantly induced by all but two mutants, with clear correlation with the extent of ER retention and the predicted mutation structural effect. These data identify a new molecular pathway, associated with gain of function effect, possibly involved in pathogenesis of FD."

    "title": "<i>D313Y</i> Variant in Fabry Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence in the literature indicating a strong correlation between Fabry disease (FD) phenotypes and specific sequence variations in the Galactosidase Alpha (<i>GLA</i>) gene. Among them, the potential pathogenicity and clinical relevance of <i>D313Y</i> variation in patients with FD remain debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting <i>D313Y</i> as single occurring variant in the <i>GLA</i> gene and sought to evaluate (1) the prevalence of <i>D313Y</i> variation in different populations with or without clinical manifestations of FD, (2) the clinical FD phenotype in <i>D313Y</i>-positive patients, and (3) the proportion of <i>D313Y</i>-positive patients presenting abnormal laboratory findings (alpha-galactosidase-A deficiency or globotriaosylceramide accumulation). Forty cohorts comprising 211 individuals with <i>D313Y</i> variation among 42,723 participants with available <i>GLA</i> gene-sequencing data were included. Patients highly suspected for FD had a higher prevalence of <i>D313Y</i> variation (4.9%, 95% CI 1.6%-9.9%; I<sup>2</sup> = 95.5%) compared with the general population (0%, 95% CI 0%-0.1%; I<sup>2</sup> = 1.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.004). The prevalence of <i>D313Y</i> variation was 0.6% (95% CI 0.3%-1%; I<sup>2</sup> = 74.1%), 0.4% (95% CI 0.2%-0.7%; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), and 0.3% (95% CI 0.2%-0.4%; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) in patients presenting with neurologic, cardiac, or renal manifestations, respectively. <i>D313Y</i> was associated with a milder, late-onset FD phenotype, as indicated by the mean patient age of 51 years (95% CI 44-59; I<sup>2</sup> = 94%) and the evidence of alpha-galactosidase A deficiency and globotriaosylceramide accumulation in 26.7% (95% CI 15.3%-40%; I<sup>2</sup> = 34%) and 16.2% (95% CI 8%-26.4%; I<sup>2</sup> = 35%) of cases, respectively. <i>D313Y</i>-positive patients displayed predominantly neurologic FD manifestations (58.1%, 95% CI 37.7%-77.1%; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%), with central and peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) involvement noted in 28.2% (95% CI 15.4%-43.2%; I<sup>2</sup> = 51%) and 28.5% (95% CI 17.8%-40.5%; I<sup>2</sup> = 61%) of cases, respectively. <i>D313Y</i> variation seems to correlate with an atypical, mild late-onset phenotype with predominantly neurologic FD manifestations. Monitoring for CNS/PNS involvement is thus paramount to identify <i>D313Y</i>-positive patients with latent or early-FD pathology, which may qualify for enzyme-replacement therapy or chaperone treatment."

    "title": "Triglyceride Lowering with Pemafibrate to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk.",
    "abstract": "High triglyceride levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but whether reductions in these levels would lower the incidence of cardiovascular events is uncertain. Pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator, reduces triglyceride levels and improves other lipid levels. In a multinational, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level, 200 to 499 mg per deciliter), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels of 40 mg per deciliter or lower to receive pemafibrate (0.2-mg tablets twice daily) or matching placebo. Eligible patients were receiving guideline-directed lipid-lowering therapy or could not receive statin therapy without adverse effects and had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 100 mg per deciliter or lower. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, or death from cardiovascular causes. Among 10,497 patients (66.9% with previous cardiovascular disease), the median baseline fasting triglyceride level was 271 mg per deciliter, HDL cholesterol level 33 mg per deciliter, and LDL cholesterol level 78 mg per deciliter. The median follow-up was 3.4 years. As compared with placebo, the effects of pemafibrate on lipid levels at 4 months were -26.2% for triglycerides, -25.8% for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, -25.6% for remnant cholesterol (cholesterol transported in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins after lipolysis and lipoprotein remodeling), -27.6% for apolipoprotein C-III, and 4.8% for apolipoprotein B. A primary end-point event occurred in 572 patients in the pemafibrate group and in 560 of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.15), with no apparent effect modification in any prespecified subgroup. The overall incidence of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups, but pemafibrate was associated with a higher incidence of adverse renal events and venous thromboembolism and a lower incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, the incidence of cardiovascular events was not lower among those who received pemafibrate than among those who received placebo, although pemafibrate lowered triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, and apolipoprotein C-III levels.

Mutation in α-Gal A possibly causes the protein misfolding, which reduces catalytic activity and stability of the enzyme. A recent study demonstrated that the binding of galactose on the α-Gal A catalytic site significantly increases its stability. Herein, the effect of mutation on secondary structure, structural energy, and galactose affinity of α-Gal A (wild type and A143T variant) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations based on MM/GBSA method. The results showed that A143T mutation caused the formation of unusual H-bonds that induced the change in secondary structure and binding affinities toward galactose. The amino acid residues involved in galactose binding were identified. The molecular binding mechanism obtained from this study could be helpful for optimizations and designs of new galactose analogs as pharmacological chaperones against Fabry disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by a reduction in α-galactosidase A enzyme activity and the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL3) and its metabolites in the cells of various organs. Agalsidase beta, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is approved for use in patients with FD in Europe, Canada, Australia, South America, and Asia, and is the only ERT approved for use in the United States. In this review, we discuss the clinical relevance of GL3 accumulation, the effect of agalsidase beta on GL3 in target tissues, and the association between treatment-related tissue GL3 clearance and long-term structure, function, or clinical outcomes. Accumulation of GL3 in the kidney, heart, vasculature, neurons, skin, gastrointestinal tract and auditory system correlates to cellular damage and irreversible organ damage, as a result of sclerosis, fibrosis, apoptosis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Damage leads to renal dysfunction and end-stage renal disease; myocardial hypertrophy with heart failure and arrhythmias; ischemic stroke; neuropathic pain; skin lesions; intestinal ischemia and dysmotility; and hearing loss. Treatment with agalsidase beta is effective in substantially clearing GL3 in a range of cells from the tissues affected by FD. Agalsidase beta has also been shown to slow renal decline and lower the overall risk of clinical progression, demonstrating an indirect link between treatment-related GL3 clearance and stabilization of FD."

Objectives were to characterize effects of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on oral clearance (CL), predict doses in mild to moderate renal impairment and in pediatric patients with FD, and to improve designs of FD studies. A 2-compartment model was fit to data from 260 subjects with/without FD and iteratively refined with evolving data. FD, eGFR, and weight affected CL, while weight and FD affected volume. Optimal sampling theory was used to choose pharmacokinetic sampling times for pediatric studies. Doses in patients with renal impairment and in pediatrics were determined by targeting exposure in adults receiving migalastat 123 mg every other day. A clinical study was conducted in 20 adolescent patients with FD ≥45 kg. eGFR had the largest effect on CL. Simulations showed that exposures in moderate renal impairment were within phase 2-3 exposures; patients aged 2-17 years require weight-based dosing; and predicted exposures in adolescent patients ≥45 kg receiving migalastat 123 mg every other day were similar to adults (data confirmed in a clinical study). Model-informed drug development optimized dosing and design of clinical studies and supported that no dose adjustments were needed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or in adolescent patients ≥45 kg."

However, little is known about the prevalence of Fabry nephropathy (FN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We extracted FN data from the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry, analyzed the prevalence of FN, and examined the correlation between clinical characteristics and renal involvement according to sex differences and hemi- and heterozygosity in patients with FD. A total of 38,351 participants who underwent renal biopsy were retrospectively enrolled, and FN was determined. The clinical characteristics of FD patients were examined based on sex differences. Twenty-nine patients (0.076%) (19 males and 10 females, mean age: 43.7 ± 15.5 years old) were diagnosed with FN. Median estimated urinary protein (UP) and mean eGFR levels were 0.9 [interquartile range (IQR) [0.7-1.6] g/gCr and 67.1 ± 36.8 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 126.4 ± 17.1 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 76.1 ± 12.6 mmHg. An inverse correlation between eGFR and logarithm UP levels was observed (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.23, p = 0.02), SBP was positively associated with logarithm UP (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.34, p = 0.004) overall and inversely associated with eGFR (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.25, p = 0.007) regardless of sex, and SBP was an independent determinant of proteinuria (p = 0.004) and eGFR (p = 0.007). The prevalence of biopsy-proven FN was 0.076%. Since SBP is associated with eGFR regardless of zygosity, strict SBP control might be necessary to prevent progression to end-stage kidney disease in both male and female patients with FN."

We identified clinical factors predictive of increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with FD targeted to improve clinical outcomes. Ninety-five patients studied over a median follow-up time of 6.3 years, and 26 patients reached the composite endpoint with a high prevalence of heart failure and cerebrovascular events and no cardiac-related mortality. Patients with MACE had worse health-related quality of life scores. Hypertrophy and presence of myocardial fibrosis increase risk of MACE by 4-5 times, and dyslipidemia increases risk of MACE by 3 times. Early Fabry-specific treatment and close monitoring of comorbidities reduce cardiac complications and mortality. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive multidisciplinary management to help improve outcomes in FD patients."

Ocular manifestations can occur in childhood and be a clue to earlier diagnosis. The aim was to report ocular outcome and visual quality of life (QoL) in patients with FD. FD-patients recruited from Karolinska University Hospital underwent ophthalmological examinations including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refraction, biomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography, keratometry, review of medical records and QoL Inventories. A total severity score (TSS), as estimated via Fabry Stabilization Index, was calculated. Twenty-six FD-patients (16 men) mean age 36.4 years (range 5.0-63.5 years) were included. BCVA was median 1.0 (range 0.5-1.6). Conjunctival blood vessel tortuosity occurred in 15/26 patients, chemosis in 2/26 patients, cornea verticillata in 23/26 patients, lens opacities in 19/26 patients, and tortuous or dilated retinal vessels in 20/25 patients. Group-wise comparisons of adult patients showed no differences regarding age, TSS, or ocular parameters. Overall, TSS was correlated to age (r = 0.53, p = 0.02). A linear regression model showed that age and sex explained 38% of the variance in TSS. Keratometry did not reveal corneal ectasia in any of the 12 patients examined. VFQ 25 in 15 patients showed a high median composite score, 93.6 (range: 78.1-100). BCVA in FD-patients was good despite corneal and lens pathology. Ocular variables did not show an association with TSS in adult patients. Corneal or lens opacities should also lead to a suspicion of FD in children."

Mutations result in abnormal cholesterol trafficking, which is manifested by abnormal cholesterol and glycosphingolipid accumulation in lysosomes of various cells. The patient had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, depression, and elevated alkaline phosphatase and initially presented for a workup regarding chronic kidney disease stage G3b/A3 with proteinuria of 1.9 g/day. Kidney biopsy revealed numerous lamellar bodies (LB) in podocytes with differential diagnoses of Fabry disease (FD), nail-patella syndrome (which is associated with <i>LMX1B</i> gene mutations), and drug-induced phospholipidosis per pathology report. Her workup was negative for a galactosidase-alpha (<i>GLA</i>) mutation with normal serum and leukocyte alpha-galactosidase A activity. She was serendipitously discovered to have compound heterozygous mutations in <i>NPC1</i> genes (one pathogenic and the other a variant of uncertain significance) from the comprehensive lysosomal storage gene panel as part of her genetic workup for FD. Further studies were done to determine the significance of the <i>NPC1</i> mutation and revealed elevated oxysterols. (The profile was consistent with NPC, with elevated cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol and 7-ketocholesterol and normal lyso-sphingomyelin.) Sonogram revealed hepatosplenomegaly (liver measuring 20 cm and spleen 15.8 cm). These findings in conjunction with lysosomal lipid accumulation on kidney biopsy were consistent with NPC. She was on 2 cationic amphiphilic agents (CAAs), fluoxetine and atorvastatin, both of which were stopped. There was no significant difference in proteinuria 2 months off CAAs. The treatment of NPC remained supportive care and avoiding medications that can induce seizures or excessive salivary secretion. The presence of LB is classically described as a feature of FD which is an LSD. Niemann-Pick type C is another example of an LSD and is typically manifested by neurovisceral symptoms and varies by the age of onset. Renal diseases are typically not described as one of the manifestations of NPC. To our knowledge, there is only one report each for Niemann-Pick disease type A/B and NPC with LB on kidney biopsy. The finding reaffirms that the presence of LB indicates lysosomal lipid accumulation from a variety of etiologies and is not a pathognomonic finding of FD. Niemann-Pick type C should be included as one of the diseases capable of causing renal LB."

Patients (n = 58, age 40 (29-51) years, 31 female) with genetically proven AFD had undergone CMR including left ventricular (LV) volumetry, mass index (LVMi), T1, and late gadolinium enhancement, complemented by LA and LV strain measurements and atrial emptying fractions. Patients were stratified into three disease phases and compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n = 58, age 41 [26-56] years, 31 female). A total of 19 early-, 20 intermediate-, and 19 advanced-phase patients were included. LV and LA reservoir strain was significantly impaired in all AFD phases, including early disease (both p < 0.001). In contrast, LA volumetry, T1, and LVMi showed no significant differences between the early phase and HC (p > 0.05). In the intermediate phase, LVMi and T1 demonstrated significant differences. In advanced phase, all parameters except active emptying fractions differed significantly from HC. ROC curve analyses of early disease phases revealed superior diagnostic confidence for the LA reservoir strain (AUC 0.88, sensitivity 89%, specificity 75%) over the LV strain (AUC 0.82). LA reservoir strain showed impairment in early AFD and significantly correlated with disease severity. The novel approach performed better in identifying early disease than the established approach using LVMi and T1. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these results justify earlier initiation of therapy and help minimize cardiac complications. • Parameters of left atrial function and deformation showed impairments in the early stages of Anderson-Fabry disease and correlated significantly with the severity of Anderson-Fabry disease. • Left atrial reservoir strain performed superior to ventricular strain in detecting early myocardial involvement in Anderson-Fabry disease and improved diagnostic accuracies of approaches already using ventricular strain. • Further studies are needed to evaluate whether earlier initiation of enzyme replacement therapy based on these results can help minimize cardiac complications from Anderson-Fabry disease."

FD diagnosis relies on the clinical manifestations and research of GLA gene mutations. However, because of the lack of a clear genotype/phenotype correlation, FD diagnosis can be challenging. Recently, several studies have highlighted the importance of investigating DNA methylation patterns for confirming the correct diagnosis of different rare Mendelian diseases, but to date, no such studies have been reported for FD. Thus, in the present investigation, we analyzed for the first time the genome-wide methylation profile of a well-characterized cohort of patients with Fabry disease. We profiled the methylation status of about 850,000 CpG sites in 5 FD patients, all carrying the same mutation in the GLA gene (exon 6 c.901C>G) and presenting comparable low levels of α-Gal A activity. We found that, although the whole methylome profile did not discriminate the FD group from the unaffected one, several genes were significantly differentially methylated in Fabry patients. Thus, we provide here a proof of concept, to be tested in patients with different mutations and in a larger cohort, that the methylation state of specific genes can potentially identify Fabry patients and possibly predict organ involvement and disease evolution."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) (OMIM #301500) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). LSDs are characterized by inappropriate lipid accumulation in lysosomes due to specific enzyme deficiencies. In FD, the defective enzyme is α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which is due to a mutation in the <i>GLA</i> gene on the X chromosome. The enzyme deficiency leads to a continuous deposition of neutral glycosphingolipids (globotriaosylceramide) in the lysosomes of numerous tissues and organs, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, corneal epithelial cells, renal glomeruli and tubules, cardiac muscle and ganglion cells of the nervous system. This condition leads to progressive organ failure and premature death. The increasing understanding of FD, and LSD in general, has led in recent years to the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which aims to slow, if not halt, the progression of the metabolic disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of the main features of FD, focusing on its molecular mechanism and the role of biomarkers."

Herein, we reported on a case of IgA nephropathy and renal disease that mimicked FD in a female patient. The presence of zebra bodies in the cytoplasm of glomerular podocytes is widely accepted as a hallmark pathological manifestation of FD. In the present case, renal biopsy analysis revealed the presence of zebra bodies; however, genetic testing indicated that the patient did not have FD. The mechanisms and causes of zebra body formation remained unclear in the present case. However, the patient responded well to treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker. The reported findings can be useful for the differential diagnosis of FD and renal diseases in the future. Our results also highlight the clinical significance of zebra bodies in renal disease."

Fabry's disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the alpha-galactosidase A gene and presents with a wide range of gastrointestinal, skin, vascular, renal and neurological manifestations. FMF and FD share similar manifestations, which may lead to misdiagnosis of one as the other; mostly FD is misdiagnosed as FMF. Moreover, various overlapping manifestations may stem from comorbidities, commonly coupled to FMF (such as Behcet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis), as well as from colchicine adverse effects, which may add to the diagnostic confusion. Thus, we postulated that screening FMF for FD will lead to the identification of patients falsely diagnosed with FMF or who, in addition to FMF, suffer from FD that was previously missed. To identify missed FD among the FMF population, we performed chemical and genetic analyses for FD in blood samples obtained from a cohort of FMF patients followed in the specialized FMF center of our institution. To increase the likelihood of detecting patients with FD, we enriched the surveyed FMF population with patients exhibiting manifestations shared by patients with FD or who deviate from the typical FMF presentation. Of 172 surveyed FMF patients in a cohort derived from a clinic dedicated to FMF, none had FD. Thus, the postulation of increased odds for detecting FD in patients with FMF was not confirmed. Further exploration for FD in FMF population, is nevertheless recommended."

As the currently available treatment options and their influence on disease progression differ greatly within the spectrum of LSDs, willingness to undergo gene therapy might vary among patients with LSDs and/or their representatives. The width of the LSD spectrum is illustrated by the differences between type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III). For type 1 Gaucher and Fabry disease several therapies are available, resulting in a near normal or improved, but individually varying, prognosis. No treatment options are available for MPS III. To identify factors influencing patients' and/or their representatives' decisions regarding undergoing gene therapy. Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease and MPS III. Parents of MPS III patients were included as patients' representatives. Nine Gaucher patients, 23 Fabry patients, two adult MPS III patients and five parents of MPS III patients participated in the study. The five main themes that arose were: outcome of gene therapy, risks and side effects, burden of gene therapy treatment, current situation and ethical aspects. Participants' views ranged from hesitance to eagerness to undergo gene therapy, which seemed to be mostly related to disease severity and currently available treatment options. Severe disease, limited treatment options and limited effectiveness of current treatment augmented the willingness to choose gene therapy. Gaucher and Fabry patients deemed the burden of treatment important. Fabry and MPS III patients and parents considered outcome important, suggesting hope for improvement. When asked to rank the factors discussed in the focus group discussions, Gaucher patients ranked outcome low, which could indicate a more cautious attitude towards gene therapy. This study underlines the importance of exploring patients' needs and expectations before using limited resources in the development of therapies for patient groups of which a significant subset may not be willing to undergo that specific therapy."

    "title": "Balance control impairments in Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. This deficiency leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids leading to progressive and multisystemic disease, including renal, cardiac, and neurological damages. FD may also have neuro-otological and visual impairments, which can generate postural control alterations, inner ear, and vision being involved in this function. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of FD on postural control. In total, fourteen adult patients (8 men/6 women, mean age = 37.6 ± 11.4 years) and two children (mean age = 11 years) with FD and 19 healthy adults (12 men/7 women, mean age = 36.5 ± 16.9 years) and two healthy children (mean age = 10.5 years) took part in this study. Postural control was evaluated by a sensory organization test combining three visual situations (eyes open, eyes closed, and sway referenced visual surround motion) with two platform situations (stable platform and sway referenced platform motion), aiming to calculate a composite equilibrium score (CES), a high score being representative of good postural control. Somatosensory (R<sup>SOM</sup>), visual (R<sup>VIS</sup>), and vestibular (R<sup>VEST</sup>) contributions to postural control were calculated, a low score reflecting a poor use of the indicated sensory input. The CES was lower in adult patients with FD compared with the healthy subjects (<i>p</i> < 0.001). R<sup>VIS</sup> (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and R<sup>VEST</sup> (<i>p</i> = 0.003) were lower in patients with FD compared with the control group, whereas no difference in R<sup>SOM</sup> was observed. Inner ear and visual pathologies associated with the central nervous system impairments are factors of postural control impairments. Physical activities, which can also be rehabilitative, by maintaining or increasing the weight of proprioception, may help diminish dependency on altered sensorial inputs."

    "title": "Rare lysosomal disease registries: lessons learned over three decades of real-world evidence.",
    "abstract": "Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are rare diseases, caused by inherited deficiencies of lysosomal enzymes/transporters, that affect 1 in 7000 to 1 in 8000 newborns. Individuals with LSDs face long diagnostic journeys during which debilitating and life-threatening events can occur. Clinical trials and classical descriptions of LSDs typically focus on common manifestations, which are not representative of the vast phenotypic heterogeneity encountered in real-world experience. Additionally, recognizing that there was a limited understanding of the natural history, disease progression, and real-world clinical outcomes of rare LSDs, a collaborative partnership was pioneered 30 years ago to address these gaps. The Rare Disease Registries (RDR) (for Gaucher, Fabry, Mucopolysaccharidosis type I, and Pompe), represent the largest observational database for these LSDs. Over the past thirty years, data from the RDRs have helped to inform scientific understanding and the development of comprehensive monitoring and treatment guidelines by creating a framework for data collection and establishing a standard of care, with an overarching goal to improve the quality of life of affected patients. Here, we highlight the history, process, and impact of the RDRs, and discuss the lessons learned and future directions."

    "abstract": "Inborn metabolic diseases or inborn errors of metabolism comprise a large number of rare and heterogeneous genetic diseases categorized in several subgroups depending on their pathophysiologic mechanisms. In this review, we focus on different metabolic diseases with respiratory symptoms in adults: lysosomal glycosphingolipidoses such as acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann-Pick types A and B disease), Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe diseases and mucopolysaccharidoses in general. We also address classical homocystinuria, which is a monogenic vascular disease, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which is associated with disorders in the lysosomal-related-organelles, and lysinuric protein intolerance, which is due to an amino-acid transporter defect. Presentation and prognosis of these diseases are highly heterogeneous, and respiratory impairment may be central and prognostic. Many are primarily pediatric, and diagnoses are often delivered during childhood. Improved pediatric management has enabled better prognosis and new phenotype of the diseases in the adulthood. Some others can be diagnosed during adulthood. While some diseases call for specific, specialized treatment, all necessitate systematic multidisciplinary management. It is of paramount importance that a pneumologist be familiar with these phenotypes, most of which can benefit from early diagnosis and early therapeutic management with dedicated innovative treatments."

For this reason, we planned to LVH-TR (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Turkish Population) trial to determine the aetiological causes and demographic characteristics of LVH patients. Our study was a multicentre, national, observational study and included 886 patients who applied to the cardiology clinics in 22 centres between February 2020 and August 2021. In the initial evaluation, the Fabry disease (FD) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) algorithm was followed in patients whose definitive etiologic cause(s) could not be identified. The most common aetiological causes of LVH in our study were hypertension with a rate of 56.6%, heart valve disease with 8.2%, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with 7.5%. Athlete's heart was detected in eight patients, LV non-compaction was detected in four patients. The rate of LVH of unknown cause was 18.8%. FD was suspected in 143 patients, and CA was suspected in 16 patients. There were 43 (4.85%) patients with low α-galactosidase A enzyme levels. GLA gene mutation analysis was positive in 1.58% of all patients, and these patients were diagnosed with FD, and 15 (1.69%) patients were diagnosed with CA by endomyocardial biopsy method. In the aetiology of LVH, the rate of LVH of unknown cause was high. FD and CA should be considered primarily in this patient group. Early diagnosis of the disease by following the schemes leading to FD and CA was essential in starting treatment before the progression of the disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inherited lysosomal metabolism disorder in which globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulates in various organs resulting from a deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A. The clinical features of FD include progressive impairments of the renal, cardiac, and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, patients with FD often develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression and dementia, which are believed to be induced by the cellular injury of cerebrovascular and partially neuronal cells due to Gb3 accumulation. Although the analysis of autopsy brain tissue from patients with FD showed no accumulation of Gb3, abnormal deposits of Gb3 were found in the neurons of several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Therefore, in this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with FD and differentiated them into neuronal cells to investigate pathological and biological changes in the neurons of FD. Neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons were successfully differentiated from the iPSCs we generated; however, cellular damage and morphological changes were not found in these cells. Immunostaining revealed no Gb3 accumulation in NSCs and neurons. Transmission electron microscopy did not reveal any zebra body-like structures or inclusion bodies, which are characteristic of FD. These results indicated that neuronal cells derived from FD-iPSCs exhibited normal morphology and no Gb3 accumulation. It is likely that more in vivo environment-like cultures are needed for iPSC-derived neurons to reproduce disease-specific features."

    "abstract": "We monitored anti-drug antibodies and disease-specific biomarkers in three patients with a nonsense mutation from a Japanese Fabry family treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In two male patients from the family, neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were induced at an early stage of ERT, the antibody titer peak being found at an earlier stage of ERT in the patient treated with 1.0 mg/kg agalsidase beta than in that treated with 0.2 mg/kg agalsidase alfa. Then, the antibody titers decreased with continuation of ERT. The formation of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies adversely affected the plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) level and urinary globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) excretion in both patients, the impact being greater in the patient treated with 0.2 mg/kg agalsidase alfa than in that treated with 1.0 mg/kg agalsidase beta. The difference might be explained by the different doses of the infused enzymes based on supersaturation of the antibodies. In a heterozygous Fabry female from the family, no sign of antibody formation was found, and both the plasma Lyso-Gb3 level and urinary Gb3 excretion, which were moderately increased at the baseline, decreased gradually. No deterioration of the manifestations or laboratory findings was observed during ERT in either of the patients. Thus, monitoring of anti-drug antibodies and biomarkers in these Fabry patients provided us with important information on their pathological condition during ERT."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism. It is a monogenic disease due to α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) enzyme deficiency, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL3) within lysosomes beginning in utero. Multiple systems are involved, most notably the vascular, renal, cardiac, and nervous systems. Early clinical manifestations include neuropathic pain, angiokeratomas, anhidrosis, cornea verticillata, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In the later stages, FD manifests with transient ischemic attacks, strokes, hearing loss, and life-threatening complications involving the kidneys and heart. Cardiac involvement in Fabry disease is typically characterized by increased left ventricular wall thickness/mass, functional abnormalities, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and heart failure. The life expectancy of the patient with untreated Fabry disease falls significantly once cardiac or renal manifestations develop. This review will focus on the cardiac manifestations of FD and the role of multimodality imaging in diagnosis and follow-up."

    "title": "Dysregulated DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A and subsequent accumulation of glycosphingolipids with terminal α-D-galactosyl residues. The molecular process through which this abnormal metabolism of glycosphingolipids causes multisystem dysfunction in Fabry disease is not fully understood. We sought to determine whether dysregulated DNA methylation plays a role in the development of this disease. In the present study, using isogenic cellular models derived from Fabry patient endothelial cells, we tested whether manipulation of α-galactosidase A activity and glycosphingolipid metabolism affects DNA methylation. Bisulfite pyrosequencing revealed that changes in α-galactosidase A activity were associated with significantly altered DNA methylation in the androgen receptor promoter, and this effect was highly CpG loci-specific. Methylation array studies showed that α-galactosidase A activity and glycosphingolipid levels were associated with differential methylation of numerous CpG sites throughout the genome. We identified 15 signaling pathways that may be susceptible to methylation alterations in Fabry disease. By incorporating RNA sequencing data, we identified 21 genes that have both differential mRNA expression and methylation. Upregulated expression of collagen type IV alpha 1 and alpha 2 genes correlated with decreased methylation of these two genes. Methionine levels were elevated in Fabry patient cells and Fabry mouse tissues, suggesting that a perturbed methionine cycle contributes to the observed dysregulated methylation patterns. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that α-galactosidase A deficiency and glycosphingolipid storage may affect DNA methylation homeostasis and highlights the importance of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of Fabry disease and, possibly, of other lysosomal storage disorders."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a congenital lysosomal storage disease, and most of these cases develop organ damage in middle age. There are some promising therapeutic options for this disorder, which can stabilize the progression of the disease. However, a long delay in diagnosis prevents early intervention, resulting in treatment failure. Because Fabry disease is a rare disease, it is not well recognized and disease specific screening tests are rarely performed. Hence, a novel approach to for detecting patients with a widely practiced clinical test is crucial for the early detection of the disease. Recently, decision support systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed in many clinical fields. However, the construction of these models requires datasets from a large number of samples; this aspect is one of the main obstacles in AI-based approaches for rare diseases. In this study, with a novel image amplification method to construct the dataset for AI-model training, we built the deep neural-network model to detect Fabry cases from their urine samples. Sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC of the models on validation dataset were 0.902 (95% CI, 0.900-0.903), 0.977 (0.950-0.980), and 0.968 (0.964-0.972), respectively. This model could also extract disease-specific findings that are interpretable with human recognition. These results indicate that we can apply novel AI models for rare diseases based on this image amplification method we developed. We expect this approach could contribute to the diagnosis of Fabry disease. This is the first reported AI-based decision support system to detect undiagnosed Fabry cases, and our new image amplification method will contribute to the AI models for other rare disorders."

    "abstract": "Electron microscopy enables a finely detailed analysis of ultra-structural features, and hence, it generally has an added diagnostic value to light microscopy alone. However, no studies have verified the additional diagnostic value of electron microscopic examination in patients with suspected non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. A total of 294 consecutive patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent endomyocardial biopsy were prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into three groups according to left ventricular morphology assessed using echocardiography. Myocardial specimens were collected from the right ventricular septum and examined by light microscopy. Electron microscopy was performed subsequently to evaluate the additional diagnostic value. Altogether, 294 patients were analyzed, including 160 (55 %), 96 (33 %), and 35 (12 %) patients who were diagnosed with primary, secondary, and unclassified cardiomyopathy, respectively. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy-like morphology, the detection rate of disease-specific histological findings was relatively low compared to that in patients with other cardiac morphologies. The additional diagnostic value of electron microscopy was observed in eight patients, including five with Fabry disease, one with cardiac amyloidosis, one with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, and one with triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy. Among the 18 cardiac amyloidosis cases, electron microscopy detected amyloid fibrils in all patients, whereas light microscopy could not detect amyloid deposition in 1 patient. Among one of five patients with Fabry disease, light microscopy did not show obvious vacuolated cardiomyocytes, but zebra bodies were detected by electron microscopy, leading to the diagnosis of cardiac Fabry disease. The diagnostic value of electron microscopic examination in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis was not observed. The additional diagnostic value of electron microscopy was observed in patients with secondary cardiomyopathy, in whom light microscopy did not show disease-specific histological findings. Electron microscopy should be performed in cases where secondary cardiomyopathy is strongly suspected with no disease-specific findings by light microscopy."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to pathogenic variants of the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene, leading to a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. The inadequate enzymatic activity leads to progressive glycosphingolipids accumulation within tissues and subsequent multi-systemic dysfunction, with predominant involvement of heart, kidney, and nervous system. Two subtypes are recognized: the classic type and the late-onset type. We here describe the clinical characteristics of a patient with late-onset Fabry disease carrying a not previously identified GLA gene variant. This 50-year-old man came to hospital because of an acute ischemic stroke. He also complained of acroparesthesia and had angiokeratomas in the nape and the back. Blood alpha-galactosidase A activity was low, plasmatic lyso-Gb3 level was borderline, cardiac MRI showed cardiac fibrosis, brain MRI documented cerebrovascular disease, and skin biopsy revealed small fiber neuropathy without globotriaosylceramide-3 skin deposits. Genetic study by means of targeted next-generation sequencing analysis disclosed a missense substitution c.1139C>T (p.Pro380Leu) in the GLA gene. We suggest that this novel variant should be considered as pathogenic and associated with a late-onset variant of Fabry disease with a predominant neurological phenotype."

Due to the accumulation of Gb3, cardiac, renal, neurological, and skin manifestations can be observed. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta is the cornerstone in the management of FD. Both enzymes are clinically effective and widely used. In this study, we present a 19-year-old male patient with FD who had received ERT for almost two and half years without any complications. In January 2021, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Later, he developed an infusion reaction during his first ERT infusion following the resolution of COVID-19 infection. The patient experienced shortness of breath, shivering, and rash. Despite decreased infusion rate and premedication in repetitive infusion, his symptoms were not resolved. Subsequently, he developed an IgE antibody against agalsidase beta, and his skin prick test was positive. Since IgG positivity against agalsidase beta was also detected, agalsidase beta was replaced with agalsidase alfa. The patient did not experience any allergic reaction with agalsidase alfa. Moderate to severe allergic reactions during ERT infusion should be alarming for IgE development. Furthermore, COVID-19 should be considered a trigger for allergic reaction against ERT in patients with FD."

The aim of the present study was to analyse the incidence and predictors of clinical events in patients on ERT. Multicentre retrospective observational analysis of patients diagnosed and treated with ERT for Fabry disease. The primary outcome was the first renal, neurological or cardiological events or death during a follow-up of 60 months (24-120). In 69 patients (42 males, 27 females, mean age 44.6±13.7 years), at the end of follow-up, eGFR and the left ventricular septum thickness remained stable and the urinary albumin: creatinine ratio tended to decrease, but this decrease only approached significance in patients on agalsidase-beta (242-128mg/g (p=0.05). At the end of follow-up, 21 (30%) patients had suffered an incident clinical event: 6 renal, 2 neurological and 13 cardiological (including 3 deaths). Events were more frequent in patients with baseline eGFR≤60ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (log Rank 12.423, p=0.001), and this remained significant even after excluding incident renal events (log Rank 4.086, p=0.043) and in males and in females. Lower baseline eGFR was associated with a 3- to 7-fold increase the risk of clinical events in different Cox models. GFR at the initiation of ERT is the main predictor of clinical events, both in males and in females, suggesting that start of ERT prior to the development of CKD is associated with better outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: The efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in mobilizing globotryaosylceramide (GB-3) from Fabry cardiomyocytes is limited. The mechanism involved is still obscure. Methods: Assessment of M6Pr, M6Pr-mRNA, and Ubiquitin has been obtained by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR of frozen endomyocardial biopsy samples, from 17 pts with FD, various degree of left ventricular hypertrophy, and maximal wall thickening (MWT) from 11.5 and 20 mm. The diagnosis and severity of FDCM followed definitions of GLA mutation, α-galactosidase A enzyme activity, cardiac magnetic resonance, and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy with the quantification of myocyte hypertrophy and the extent of Gb-3 accumulation. All patients have received alpha or beta agalsidase for ≥3 years without a reduction in LV mass nor an increase in T1 mapping at CMR. Controls were surgical biopsies from 15 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement. Results: Protein analysis showed mean M6Pr in FDCM to be 5.4-fold lower than in a normal heart (4289 ± 6595 vs. 23,581 ± 4074, p = 0.0996) (p < 0.001): specifically, 9-fold lower in males, p = 0.009, (p < 0.001) and 3-fold lower in females, p = 0.5799, (p < 0.001) showing, at histology, a mosaic of normal and diseased cells. M6Pr-mRNA expression was normal, while ubiquitin showed an increase of 4.6 fold vs. controls (13,284 ± 1723 vs. 2870 ± 690, p = 0.001) suggesting that ubiquitin-dependent post-translational degradation is likely responsible for the reduction of M6Pr in FDCM. Conclusion: M6Pr expression is remarkably reduced in FDCM as a likely result of post-translational degradation. This may explain the reduced efficacy of ERT and be a therapeutic target for the enhancement of ERT activity."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is a rare, progressive, X-linked, inherited genetic disease caused by a functional deficiency of lysosomal α-galactosidase, leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in virtually all of the body's cell types and fluids. Patients with rare genetic diseases and non-specific symptoms often experience substantial diagnostic delays, which can negatively impact the prompt initiation of treatment. If FD is not treated specifically, end organ damage (such as chronic renal failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia, and strokes) impairs quality of life and reduces life expectancy. For 83 consecutive patients with FD referred to the Russian reference center for lysosomal storage diseases, family trees were built and genetic testing (cascade genotyping) was offered to family members. The pathogenic <i>GLA</i> variant associated with FD was identified for all 83 probands. Family testing using cascade genotyping enabled the identification of 165 additional cases of FD among the tested 331 at-risk family members. This is the first study to have described family screening in a large Russian cohort of patients with FD and chronic kidney disease. Raising awareness of FD among clinicians is important for earlier diagnosis and specific treatment."

    "abstract": "Even though a mutation in monogenic diseases leads to a \"classic\" manifestation, many disorders exhibit great clinical variability that could be due to modifying genes also called minor genes. Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inborn error resulting from the deficient or absent activity of alpha-galactosidase A (α-GAL) enzyme, that leads to deposits of globotriaosylceramide. With our proprietary software SNPclinic v.1.0, we analyzed 110 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the proximal promoter of 14 genes that could modify the FD phenotype FD. We found seven regulatory-SNP (rSNPs) in three genes (<i>IL10</i>, <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>EDN1</i>) in five cell lines relevant to FD (Cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, Astrocytes-cerebellar, endothelial cells and T helper cells 1-T<sub>H</sub>1). Each SNP was confirmed as a true rSNP in public eQTL databases, and additional software suggested the prediction of variants. The two proposed rSNPs in <i>IL10</i>, could explain components for the regulation of active B cells that influence the fibrosis process. The three predicted rSNPs in <i>TGFB1</i>, could act in apoptosis-autophagy regulation. The two putative rSNPs in <i>EDN1</i>, putatively regulate chronic inflammation. The seven rSNPs described here could act to modulate Fabry's clinical phenotype so we propose that <i>IL10</i>, <i>TGFB1</i> and <i>EDN1</i> be considered minor genes in FD."

Males are general more severely affected however heterozygous females can variably express the disease depending on the degree of random X chromosome inactivation (Lyonization). We present a case where cardiac magnetic resonance diagnosis of late onset Fabry Disease leads to an incidental diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome. A 55-year-old male was referred for cardiology assessment after developing atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography demonstrated moderate, concentric LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of concentric increase in LV wall thickness and increased LV (left ventricular) mass. T<sub>1</sub> mapping values (Shortened Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery sequences) were elevated in the basal-mid inferolateral segments and low in the remaining segments. Late gadolinium acquisition showed a pattern suggestive of Fabry disease. Genetic testing of the GLA gene revealed a null variant classified as pathogenic. The variant was found to be heterozygous. This raised the possibility of Klinefelter's syndrome and the diagnosis was confirmed by chromosomal microarray and karyotype. The patient was then referred to Fabry clinic for consideration of enzyme replacement therapy and to the endocrine clinic for testosterone replacement. The atypical 'cardiac variant' Fabry disease should be included in differential diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy. In a 'late onset' presentation of Fabry Disease, the concomitant presence of Klinefelter syndrome cannot be excluded due to GLA variant present in the heterozygous state."

In the case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), obstructive and nonobstructive forms can be differentiated analogously to the echo but amyloidosis or Fabry disease can also be detected. Evaluation of the right ventricular function is reliable in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The use of MRI is also able to directly detect the characteristic fibrofatty degeneration. In the rare restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCM), MRI can track restriction and, for example by means of T1, T2 and T2* mapping, detect sphingolipid accumulation in the myocardium in the context of Fabry disease or iron overload in the context of hemochromatosis. The quantitative methods of parametric mapping provide the possibility of treatment monitoring but the clinical relevance of this monitoring is still the subject of current research. The unclassified cardiomyopathies can present clinically with similar symptoms to ischemic or inflammatory diseases, so that in the case of myocardial infarction without obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) in cardiac catheterization, MRI is a decisive diagnostic tool to determine the actual underlying disease. Similarly, in new cardiomyopathies such as noncompaction cardiomyopathy, MRI can pave the way for a morphological disease definition."

    "title": "Plasma Lysosphingolipid Biomarker Measurement by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "Plasma lysosphingolipids are highly elevated in patients with Gaucher, Krabbe, Fabry, and Niemann-Pick diseases and tend to accumulate to a greater extent than their respective primary sphingolipids in the plasma of affected patients. In this chapter, we describe two liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods to measure plasma concentrations of four lysosphingolipids species. The first method described measures glucosylsphingosine (lyso-GL1) and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), biomarkers that accumulate in Gaucher and Krabbe diseases, respectively. The second method measures globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (lyso-SPM), biomarkers for Fabry and Niemann-Pick diseases, respectively. Each method utilizes isotope-labeled internal standards and multipoint calibration curves to quantify the analytes of interest. Briefly, plasma samples are mixed with five volumes of LC-MS grade methanol containing internal standard, and protein is removed via centrifugation. Supernatant is dried and resuspended in initial mobile phase. Samples are separated by liquid chromatography using either a BEH amide column (lyso-GL1 + psychosine) or a C18 column (lyso-Gb3 + lyso-SPM). Protonated analytes are measured by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in positive electrospray ionization mode. Using these methods, we have observed elevations of these lyso- species in Gaucher, Fabry, and Niemann-Pick and successfully distinguished different subtypes reflecting the disease severity."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is caused by a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which leads to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) deposition in multiple tissues. The current management of FD is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We report on the efficacy and safety of a new agalsidase beta, ISU303, in FD. Ten patients (7 males, 3 females) were enrolled and administered a 1 mg/kg dose of ISU303, every other week for 6 months. The primary endpoint was the normalization of plasma Gb3 level. The secondary endpoints were the changes from baseline in urine Gb3 and the plasma and urine lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) level. Echocardiography, renal function test, and pain-related quality of life were also assessed before and after administration. Safety evaluation was performed including vital signs, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, antibody screening tests, and adverse events at each visit. At 22 weeks of treatment, plasma and urine Gb3 level decreased by a mean of 4.01 ± 1.29 μg/mL (range 2.50-5.70) (P = .005) and 1.12 ± 1.98 μg/mg Cr. (range 0.04-5.65) (P = .017), respectively. However, no significant difference was observed in plasma and urine lyso-Gb3 levels. Echocardiography also was not changed. Renal function and pain-related quality of life showed improvements, but there was no clinical significance. No severe adverse events were observed. Only 1 patient developed an anti-drug antibody without neutralizing activity during the trial. This study showed the efficacy and safety of ISU303. Treatment with ISU303 significantly resulted in plasma and urine Gb3 decrease in patients with FD. These results suggest that ISU303 is safe and effective and can alternative ERT for FD."

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to assess the economic profile of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to symptomatic patients with Pompe, Fabry, Gaucher disease and Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency. A systematic search was performed to retrieve and critically assess economic evaluations of enzyme replacement therapy. Publications were screened according to predefined criteria and evaluated according to the Quality of Economic Studies. Data were narratively synthesized. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio greatly exceeded willingness to pay thresholds. The cost of the medication dominated the sensitivity analysis. For Infantile-onset Pompe's disease, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at €1.043.868 per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) based on the dose of alglucosidase 40 mg/kg/ week, and €286.114 per QALY for 20 mg of alglucosidase/kg/2 weeks. For adults patients presenting with Pompe disease the reported was ICER € 1.8 million/ QALY. In the case of Fabry disease, the ICER per QALY amounts to 6.1 million Euros/QALY. Respectively for Gaucher's disease, the ICER /QALY was estimated at € 884,994 per QALY. Finally, for patients presenting LAL deficiency NCPE perpetuated an ICER of €2,701,000/QALY. ERT comprise a promising treatment modality for orphan diseases; nevertheless, it is interlaced with a substantial economic burden. Moreover, the available data on the cost-effectiveness ratio are scarce. For certain diseases, such as Fabry, a thorough selection of patients could exert a beneficial effect on the reported ICER. Steep price reductions are imperative for these products, in the conventional reimbursement pathway or a new assessment framework should be elaborated, which in principle, should target uncertainty."

    "abstract": "F abry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with accumulation of globotriosylceramide, causing neurologic involvement mainly as acroparesthesias and cerebrovascular disease. Aseptic meningitis has been reported in 11 patients with FD, but no prior study has correlated alpha-galactosidase (GLA) specific variants with meningitis. We present in this manuscript a family in which a novel GLA pathogenic variant was associated with aseptic meningitis in 2 of 5 family members. This study began with identifying the proband, then screening family members for FD symptoms and evaluating symptomatic individuals for genetic and biochemical status. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and those with headache underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Five patients (3 females) from a single family were included in this study. Mean age at diagnosis was 20.6 years. Two patients (40%) had aseptic meningitis; one of them also had cerebrovascular events. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated during aseptic meningitis episodes. Both patients responded to intravenous methylprednisolone with resolution of fever, headache, and vomiting. One of them recurred and needed chronic immunosuppression with azathioprine. We described aseptic meningitis in a family with a novel GLA variant. Meningitis might be a common phenomenon in FD and not a particularity of this variant. Understanding the mechanisms underlying meningitis and its association with cerebrovascular events may lead to a new paradigm of treatment for stroke in these patients. Further prospective studies with CSF collection in patients with FD and recurrent headache could help to elucidate this question."

    "title": "Generation of GLA-knockout human embryonic stem cell lines to model peripheral neuropathy in Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked glycolipid storage disorder caused by mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene which result in a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme alpha galactosidase A (AGA). As a result, the glycolipid substrate Gb3 accumulates in critical tissues and organs producing a progressive debilitating disease. In Fabry disease up to 80% of patients experience life-long neuropathic pain that is difficult to treat and greatly affects their quality of life. The molecular mechanisms by which deficiency of AGA leads to neuropathic pain are not well understood, due in part to a lack of <i>in vitro</i> models that can be used to study the underlying pathology at the cellular level. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we generated two clones with mutations in the <i>GLA</i> gene from a human embryonic stem cell line. Our clonal cell lines maintained normal stem cell morphology and markers for pluripotency, and showed the phenotypic characteristics of Fabry disease including absent AGA activity and intracellular accumulation of Gb3. Mutations in the predicted locations in exon 1 of the <i>GLA</i> gene were confirmed. Using established techniques for dual-SMAD inhibition/WNT activation, we were able to show that our AGA-deficient clones, as well as wild-type controls, could be differentiated to peripheral-type sensory neurons that express pain receptors. This genetically and physiologically relevant human model system offers a new and promising tool for investigating the cellular mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy in Fabry disease and may assist in the development of new therapeutic strategies to help lessen the burden of this disease."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited metabolic disorder due to the pathogenic mutation of the GLA gene, which codes lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. The resultant accumulation of glycosphingolipids causes various systemic symptoms in childhood and adolescence, and major organ damage in adulthood. Cardiac involvement is important as the most frequent cause of death in Fabry disease patients. Progressive left ventricular hypertrophy with varying degrees of contractile dysfunction as well as conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias are typical cardiac features, and these findings can be evaluated in detail via non-invasive modalities, such as an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. In addition, specific therapies of enzyme replacement therapy and pharmacological chaperone therapy are available, and their beneficial effects on cardiac involvement have been reported. This minireview highlights recent evidence concerning non-invasive modalities for assessing cardiac involvement in Fabry disease and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy and pharmacological chaperone therapy on the findings of those modalities."

    "title": "Agalsidase-β should be proposed as first line therapy in classic male Fabry patients with undetectable α-galactosidase A activity.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene leading to deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-gal A). This results in progressive multisystemic glycosphingolipid accumulation, especially globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3). Enzyme replacement therapy with two recombinant enzymes, agalsidase-α and -β is approved for two different dosages. However, little is known about which enzyme is more effective in decreasing the metabolite load in male and female patients with the classic form of the disease. In this prospective observational study, 14 consecutive adult Fabry patients (10 males) with a classic GLA-mutation, were switched from agalsidase-α to agalsidase-β at the respective licensed doses. Lyso-Gb3 levels were measured before the switch and for a period of 12 months after the switch in dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. Mean age at start of the switch was 36.7 ± 14 years. Plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels decreased from 27.2 ± 17.9 ng/mL before the switch to 16.8 ± 10.5 ng/mL after the switch (mean reduction of 30.1%; p = 0.004). The decrease was maximal in the subgroup of 7 male patients with no or very low residual enzyme activity (mean reduction of 40.4%). However, two females with high residual enzyme activity also showed a reduction >30% after the switch. In male patients, the reduction of plasma Lyso-Gb3 correlated negatively with the residual α-gal A activity: r = -0.803; p = 0.009. Agalsidase-β at licensed dose is significantly more effective than agalsidase-α to reduce Lyso-Gb3 levels in classic Fabry patients, and should be used as first line therapy in classic males with no residual enzyme activity."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (AGALA) deficiency. Whereas 'classic' variant has multisystemic manifestation, the more recently described 'later-onset' variant is characterized by predominant cardiac involvement that often mimics hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Consecutive unrelated patients with HCM were screened for FD in 16 (out of 17) cardiac centres in the Czech Republic covering specialized cardiology care from June 2017 to December 2018. AGALA activity and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> ) levels were measured in all subjects using the dry blood spot method. FD was suspected in male patients with AGALA activity <1.2 μmol/h/L and in females with either low AGALA activity or lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> > 3.5 ng/mL. Positive screening results were confirmed by genetic testing. We evaluated 589 patients (390 males, 66%) with HCM (mean maximal myocardial thickness 19.1 ± 4.3 mm). The average age was 58.4 ± 14.7 years. In total, 17 patients (11 males, 6 females) had a positive screening result, and subsequently, six of them (four males and two females) had a genetically confirmed pathogenic GLA mutation (total prevalence of 1.02%). Five of these patients were carrying the p.N215S mutation known to cause a typical later-onset cardiac FD. We confirmed the prevalence of FD repeatedly reported in previous screening programmes (approximately 1% irrespective of gender) in a non-selected HCM population in Central Europe. Our findings advocate a routine screening for FD in all adult patients with HCM phenotype including both genders. The dry blood spot method used led to identification of clearly pathogenic variants."

    "title": "Plain language summary of a study looking at heart muscle thickness and kidney function in women with Fabry disease who received agalsidase beta treatment.",
    "abstract": "<b>Fabry disease</b> is a rare genetic condition that affects many different cells and organs in the body. People have Fabry disease when they inherit a <i>GLA</i> gene containing an error from one or both of their parents. This causes an enzyme in their body called <b>alpha-galactosidase</b> (also called α-<b>Gal</b>) to not work properly. In people without Fabry disease, a-Gal breaks down fats called <b>glycolipids</b>. In people with Fabry disease, as a-Gal does not work properly, glycolipids build up in the body, particularly in the cells of the kidney, heart, nerves, and the cells that line blood vessels. People who have Fabry disease can receive an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT for short) called <b>agalsidase beta</b>, which acts as a substitute for a-Gal. Although both males and females can have Fabry disease, it generally affects males more severely than females, and symptoms in females can vary significantly. Several researchers have studied the long-term effects of agalsidase beta ERT in males, but there have been fewer studies in females. This study looked at women with Fabry disease who started receiving agalsidase beta treatment when they were at least 18 years old, using information from the Fabry Registry (the largest worldwide database that collects and stores information about people with Fabry disease). The researchers evaluated heart muscle thickness (thickening can be a sign of poor heart health) and kidney function from 5 years before women with Fabry disease started agalsidase beta treatment to 5 years after they started treatment. Before women with Fabry disease started treatment, their heart muscle tended to thicken over time. After starting treatment, their heart muscle thickening slowed. Kidney function was similar to that of unaffected people both before and after treatment. This study provides a unique insight into the effects of agalsidase beta in women with Fabry disease. The findings suggest that agalsidase beta may slow heart muscle thickening and maintain normal kidney function in women with Fabry disease. <b>Clinical Trial Registration</b>: NCT00196742 (ClinicalTrials.gov)."

    "abstract": "Patients with Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) have an elevated incidence of resting arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease, but their exercise arrhythmia burden and ischemic changes are not well understood. In addition, little research has been done on heart rate recovery in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients with AFD who underwent maximal effort cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) (n=44; 38.2 ± 13.8 yr; 23 men) from 2012 through 2018. Electrocardiographic, Holter monitoring, echocardiographic, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and patient demographic data were collected. No patient had adverse events that necessitated CPET termination, whereas 25 (57%) had ectopy during CPET, including 3 (7%) with frequent premature atrial contractions and 5 (11%) with frequent premature ventricular contractions. The ectopic burden was higher during resting electrocardiographic monitoring before exercise. In addition, 7 patients (16%) had pathologic ST-segment or T-wave changes on CPET, defined as ST-segment changes ≥2 mm. Among the patients who had concurrent cardiac magnetic resonance findings with their CPET (n=27), ST-segment or T-wave changes were associated with left ventricular myocardial mass (r=0.43, P=0.02). Chronotropic incompetence was seen during CPET in 28 patients (64%); however, only 2 patients (4%) had abnormal heart rate recovery at 1 minute. This study shows that patients with AFD can safely undergo exercise testing but have a high incidence of exercise-induced arrhythmias and ischemic changes. Ischemic electrocardiographic changes during exercise testing are associated with myocardial mass. Despite the chronotropic incompetence associated with AFD, heart rate recovery appears to be generally preserved in these patients."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare metabolic disorder, in which a lifelong enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) constitutes the cornerstone of disease-specific therapy. In this study, we examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the management of FD patients. We collected data in three main domains; mood status, adherence to ERT, and COVID-19 infection. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate the mood statuses of FD patients and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) and the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) to assess patients' adherence to non-disease specific therapy. We also examined a control group to compare the mood status data. A total of 67 FD patients (males: 47.8%, mean age: 37.0 years) were recruited to the study, of which 58 were receiving ERT. Both the HADS depression and anxiety scores were higher in the control group compared to FD patients. During the first wave of the pandemic, 25 patients reported to have missed an infusion for a mean of 2.3 ± 1.7 doses and half of the patients had adopted a home-based infusion treatment regimen. COVID-19 infection developed in 25 patients, of which one died. The majority of our patients (71.6%) have had at least one shot of the vaccine. We found that FD patients were more resilient to the negative psychological effects of lockdown. Traumatic growth may be an important factor in explaining this finding. Government-supported home therapy programs might be beneficial for FD patients to increase the therapy adherence."

    "abstract": "Numerous cell functions are accompanied by phenotypic changes in viscoelastic properties, and measuring them can help elucidate higher level cellular functions in health and disease. We present a high-throughput, simple and low-cost microfluidic method for quantitatively measuring the elastic (storage) and viscous (loss) modulus of individual cells. Cells are suspended in a high-viscosity fluid and are pumped with high pressure through a 5.8 cm long and 200 µm wide microfluidic channel. The fluid shear stress induces large, ear ellipsoidal cell deformations. In addition, the flow profile in the channel causes the cells to rotate in a tank-treading manner. From the cell deformation and tank treading frequency, we extract the frequency-dependent viscoelastic cell properties based on a theoretical framework developed by R. Roscoe [1] that describes the deformation of a viscoelastic sphere in a viscous fluid under steady laminar flow. We confirm the accuracy of the method using atomic force microscopy-calibrated polyacrylamide beads and cells. Our measurements demonstrate that suspended cells exhibit power-law, soft glassy rheological behavior that is cell-cycle-dependent and mediated by the physical interplay between the actin filament and intermediate filament networks."

    "abstract": "The cardiac manifestations of Fabry disease are the leading cause of death, but risk stratification remains inadequate. Identifying patients who are at risk of adverse cardiac outcome may facilitate more evidence-based treatment guidance. Contemporary cardiovascular cardiac magnetic resonance biomarkers have become widely adopted, but their prognostic value remains unclear. The objective of this study was to develop, internally validate, and evaluate the performance of, a prognostic model, including contemporary deep phenotyping, which can be used to generate individual risk estimates for adverse cardiac outcome in patients with Fabry disease. This longitudinal prospective cohort study consisted of 200 consecutive patients with Fabry disease undergoing clinical cardiac magnetic resonance. Median follow-up was 4.5 years (IQR: 2.7-6.3 years). Prognostic models were developed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Outcome was a composite of adverse cardiac events. Model performance was evaluated. A risk calculator, which provides 5-year estimated risk of adverse cardiac outcome for individual patients, including men and women, was generated. The highest performing, internally validated, parsimonious multivariable model included age, native myocardial T<sub>1</sub> dispersion (SD of per voxel myocardial T<sub>1</sub> relaxation times), and indexed left ventricular mass. Median optimism-adjusted c-statistic across 5 imputed model development data sets was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84). Model calibration was excellent across the full risk profile. This study developed and internally validated a risk prediction model that accurately predicts 5-year risk of adverse cardiac outcome for individual patients with Fabry disease, including men and women, which could easily be integrated into clinical care. External validation is warranted."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare, progressive genetic lysosomal disorder that can cause multisystem organ dysfunction. With increasing treatment options for Fabry disease, it is imperative that patients discuss and select treatment plans in conjunction with their physicians. Although shared decision making (SDM) should be recommended for clinical decision making in disease management, evidence is limited as to how patients in Japan are involved in the choice of their Fabry disease treatment and if other gaps exist with physicians in the perception of Fabry disease management. The main objective of the study was to assess the degree of agreement between patients and treating physicians in the SDM process as assessed by the SDM-Q-9 and SDM-Q-Doc questionnaires. In parallel, this study also investigated other factors that might impact the SDM process. This was a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire survey of Japanese patients with Fabry disease and their treating physicians conducted from February 2021 to June 2021. Online surveys were developed for patients and physicians, consisting of seven items, including the Japanese version of the 9-item SDM Questionnaire for patients (SDM-Q-9) and physicians (SDM-Q-Doc). Physicians were divided into two cohorts: non-paired and paired with patients. Only the paired cohort physicians answered the SDM questionnaire. A total of 99 physicians and 30 patients answered the respective questionnaires. Among these, 13 physicians were included in a paired SDM analysis with patients. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) patient age at diagnosis of Fabry disease was 47.5 (15.8) years, and 14 (46.7%) were male. Both physicians in the paired cohort and patients considered patient-reported outcomes (both 76.7%) and the findings from laboratory testing as important (90.0% and 60.0% respectively). However, regarding symptoms that affect quality of life of patients, perception gaps were identified in that physicians in the paired cohort placed less importance on patient-reported outcome-related symptoms such as sweating abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms than their patients (0% [0/17] and 44.4% [8/18], 11.8% [2/17] and 38.9% [7/18], respectively). In the paired analysis, there was no significant difference in total SDM score between patients and physicians (<i>p</i> = 0.82). However, the largest discordance in perception between patients and physicians was identified for the explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options (weighted Kappa coefficient = 0.14). This survey revealed a gap in the perception of disease burden affecting patients' quality of life, and a recognition gap between physicians and patients when they discussed the advantages and disadvantages of treatment options. To improve the SDM process in Fabry disease management and treatment, practical solutions for bridging these gaps should be considered."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is often associated with heart failure (HF). However, data on HF prevalence, prognosis, and applicability of echocardiographic criteria for HF diagnosis in FD remain uncertain. We evaluated patients with genetically proven FD for symptoms and natriuretic peptides indicating HF. We then analysed the diagnostic utility of the currently recommended European Society of Cardiology (ESC) echocardiographic criteria for HF diagnosis and their relationship to natriuretic peptides. Finally, we examined the association between HF and echocardiographic criteria with mortality and cardiovascular events during follow-up. Of 116 patients with FD, 48 (41%) had symptomatic HF (mean age 58 ± 11 years, 62% male). HF with preserved ejection fraction (HF-pEF) was diagnosed in 43 (91%) patients, representing the dominant phenotype. Left ventricular mass index (LVMi) had the highest diagnostic utility (sensitivity 71% and specificity 83%) for HF diagnosis in FD, followed by E/e' > 9 (sensitivity 76% and specificity 78%) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) <16% (sensitivity 54% and specificity 88%). Log N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide correlated significantly with LVMi (r = 0.60), E/e' (r = 0.54), and GLS (r = 0.52) (all Ps < 0.001) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.034, P = 0.72). During follow-up (mean 1208 ± 444 days), patients diagnosed with HF had a higher rate of all-cause mortality and worsening HF (33% vs. 1.5%, P < 0.001). Abnormal LVMi, E/e' > 9, and GLS < 16% were all associated with higher all-cause mortality and worsening HF. This study found a high prevalence of symptomatic HF in FD patients. HF-pEF was the dominant phenotype. LVMi, E/e', and GLS yielded the highest diagnostic utility for HF diagnosis and were significantly correlated with natriuretic peptides levels. Echocardiographic criteria proposed by current ESC HF guidelines apply to Fabry patients and predict cardiovascular events. At follow-up, Fabry patients with HF diagnosis had high event rates and significantly worse prognosis than patients without HF."

To investigate the path to diagnosis from disease onset, and the impact of the disease on daily life, among individuals with FD in Japan. A nationwide survey of patients with FD receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was conducted between March 27 and June 11, 2018. Participants were recruited via patient support groups or physicians. Respondents completed a questionnaire eliciting information on sociodemographic status, self-perceived health status, initial and current clinical manifestations, the process of diagnosis, and impact on their life. Responses were analyzed descriptively. Data from 40 respondents were analyzed (17 males and 23 females; 77.5% aged ≥30 years). Mean ERT duration was 7.7 years. Mean time from disease onset to diagnosis was 18.7 years (16.7 years [males] vs 20.3 years [females]). The final diagnosis was made most commonly by pediatricians (38%). Forty percent of respondents felt relieved and 30% felt anxious when diagnosed, and when initiating ERT, 48% felt more positive about their daily life. Nevertheless, 85% reported that treatment affected their lives/work, and most (73%) experienced difficulties in their relationships with others. Efforts are needed to achieve early diagnosis of patients with FD in Japan, to improve clinician awareness, and improve the psychosocial issues associated with FD."

QOL was assessed using the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). Subjects affected by FD reported an overall reduced QOL (EQ-VAS: 71.8±20.0). Most frequently reported complaints occurred within the dimensions pain/discomfort (69.7%), daily activities (48.9%) and anxiety/depression (45.4%). Compared to ACHD, individuals with FD scored significantly lower in the areas of pain/discomfort, usual activities and mobility (all P<0.05). Older age and female sex were particularly associated with diminished QOL (P=0.05). Patients with FD are at high risk for impaired QOL. They require additional support to cope with disease-related challenges. Increased attention should be directed towards improving their subjective well-being to potentially increase their QOL and long-term health outcomes."

    "title": "Renoprotective Effect of Agalsidase Alfa: A Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients with Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which, without treatment, can cause significant renal dysfunction. We evaluated the effects of enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa on renal decline in patients with Fabry disease using data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) registry. Male patients with Fabry disease aged >16 years at agalsidase alfa start were stratified by low (≤0.5 g/24 h) or high (>0.5 g/24 h) baseline proteinuria and by ‘classic’ or ‘non-classic’ phenotype. Overall, 193 male patients with low (n = 135) or high (n = 58) baseline proteinuria were evaluated. Compared with patients with low baseline proteinuria, those with high baseline proteinuria had a lower mean ± standard deviation baseline eGFR (89.1 ± 26.2 vs. 106.6 ± 21.8 mL/min/1.73 m2) and faster mean ± standard error eGFR decline (−3.62 ± 0.42 vs. −1.61 ± 0.28 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year; p < 0.0001). Patients with classic Fabry disease had similar rates of eGFR decline irrespective of baseline proteinuria; only one patient with non-classic Fabry disease had high baseline proteinuria, preventing meaningful comparisons between groups. In this analysis, baseline proteinuria significantly impacted the rate of eGFR decline in the overall population, suggesting that early treatment with good proteinuria control may be associated with renoprotective effects."

    "title": "Metabolic Fingerprinting of Fabry Disease: Diagnostic and Prognostic Aspects.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease due to a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal-galactosidase A (GalA), a key enzyme in the glycosphingolipid degradation pathway. FD is a complex disease with a poor genotype-phenotype correlation. In the early stages, FD could involve the peripheral nervous system (acroparesthesias and dysautonomia) and the ski (angiokeratoma), but later kidney, heart or central nervous system impairment may significantly decrease life expectancy. The advent of omics technologies offers the possibility of a global, integrated and systemic approach well-suited for the exploration of this complex disease. In this narrative review, we will focus on the main metabolomic studies, which have underscored the importance of detecting biomarkers for a diagnostic and prognostic purpose in FD. These investigations are potentially useful to explain the wide clinical, biochemical and molecular heterogeneity found in FD patients. Moreover, the quantitative mass spectrometry methods developed to evaluate concentrations of these biomarkers in urine and plasma will be described. Finally, the complex metabolic biomarker profile depicted in FD patients will be reported, which varies according to gender, types of mutations, and therapeutic treatment."

    "title": "Pre-existing anti-drug antibodies in Fabry disease show less affinity for pegunigalsidase alfa.",
    "abstract": "We analyzed the cross-reactivity of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against agalsidase-alfa and -beta from 49 patients with Fabry disease (FD) against the novel PEGylated enzyme pegunigalsidase-alfa (PRX-102). The affinity of purified anti-AGAL antibodies from pooled patient sera was significantly lower for PRX-102 compared to agalsidase-alfa and -beta (both p < 0.05). Pull-down experiments revealed the presence of masked epitopes on PRX-102, possibly due to PEGylation. ADA titers in serum (μg/mL) and corresponding inhibitory capacities against agalsidase-alfa and -beta were measured in male patients with FD, showing strong correlations (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9978 and 0.4930, both p < 0.001). Affinities of ADAs of individual patients against PRX-102 (K<sub>d</sub>: 3.55 ± 2.72 μmol) were significantly lower compared to agalsidase alfa (K<sub>d</sub>: 1.99 ± 1.26 μmol) and -beta (K<sub>d</sub>: 2.18 ± 1.51 μmol) (both p < 0.0001). Cross-ELISAs supported the presence of masked epitopes on PRX-102. Importantly, inhibition measurements also revealed a 30% reduction in inhibitory capacity of pre-existing ADAs towards PRX-102. Enzyme-uptake experiments in AGAL-deficient EA.hy926 cells demonstrated less effects of ADAs on cellular PRX-102 uptake compared with agalsidase beta. We conclude that due to the reduced affinity of pre-existing ADAs against agalsidase-alfa or -beta, ADA-affected patients might benefit from a therapy switch to PRX-102, which is currently evaluated in clinical trials."

    "abstract": "The accumulation of sphingolipids in Fabry's disease (FD) leads to left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and shortened T1 in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Early detection of myocardial involvement is essential for the timely initiation and efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy. However, there is a diagnostic gap between the onset of accumulation and detectable myocardial changes. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of biventricular strain assessment in early FD. Genetically proven FD patients (n = 58) and healthy volunteers (HV, n = 62) who had undergone 3 T CMR were retrospectively identified and stratified into 3 groups according to disease severity. Biventricular volumetry, global longitudinal strains (GLS), indexed biventricular masses (RVMi/LVMi), and T1 were evaluated. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA and diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by ROC-analysis. The study population included 19 group I, 20 group II and 19 group III patients. LV volumetry and T1 showed no significant difference between early FD patients and HV (all p > 0.760). However, RVMi was increased, while RV-GLS and LV-GLS were significantly impaired (p = 0.024 and < 0.001, respectively). Biventricular strains accurately discriminated early FD patients and HV with RV-GLS being non-inferior to LV-GLS (AUC for both 0.83, p > 0.05). Adding strains to the established approach using T1 and LVMi further increased diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.99, p < 0.05). Biventricular strains may help detect altered myocardial deformation patterns in phenotypically negative FD patients. These findings may lead to an earlier initiation of therapy, which in turn may slow hypertrophy and the associated long-term risks."

Global prevalence estimates of Fabry disease based on clinical ascertainment range from 1 in 40 000 to 1 in 170 000. We aimed to determine the prevalence of Fabry disease-causing variants in UK Biobank. We sought <i>GLA</i> gene variants in exome sequencing data from 200 643 individuals from UK Biobank. We used ACMG/AMP guidelines (American College of Medical Genetics/Association for Molecular Pathology) to classify pathogenicity and compared baseline biomarker data, hospital ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases version-10) codes, general practitioner records and self-reported health data with those without pathogenic variants. We identified 81 <i>GLA</i> coding variants. We identified eight likely pathogenic variants on the basis of being rare (<1/10 000 individuals) and either previously reported to cause Fabry disease, or being protein-truncating variants. Thirty-six individuals carried one of these variants. In the UK Biobank, the prevalence of likely pathogenic Fabry disease-causing variants is 1/5732 for late-onset disease-causing variants and 1/200 643 for variants causing classic Fabry disease. Fabry disease-causing <i>GLA</i> variants are more prevalent in an unselected population sample than the reported prevalence of Fabry disease. These are overwhelmingly variants associated with later onset. It is possible the prevalence of later-onset Fabry disease exceeds current estimates."

We investigated X-chromosomal inactivation patterns (XCI) as a potential determinant of symptom severity in FD women. We included 95 women with mutations in GLA (n = 18 with variants of unknown pathogenicity) and 50 related men, and collected mouth epithelial cells, venous blood, and skin fibroblasts for XCI analysis using the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. The mutated X-chromosome was identified by comparison of samples from relatives. Patients underwent genotype categorization and deep clinical phenotyping of symptom severity. 43/95 (45%) women carried mutations categorized as classic. The XCI pattern was skewed (i.e., ≥75:25% distribution) in 6/87 (7%) mouth epithelial cell samples, 31/88 (35%) blood samples, and 9/27 (33%) skin fibroblast samples. Clinical phenotype, α-galactosidase A (GAL) activity, and lyso-Gb3 levels did not show intergroup differences when stratified for X-chromosomal skewing and activity status of the mutated X-chromosome. X-inactivation patterns alone do not reliably reflect the clinical phenotype of women with FD when investigated in biomaterial not directly affected by FD. However, while XCI patterns may vary between tissues, blood frequently shows skewing of XCI patterns."

We assessed and compared the prevalence and predictors of MINOCA in a large cohort of HCM and FD patients. In this multicenter, retrospective study we enrolled 2870 adult patients with HCM and 267 with FD. The only exclusion criterion was documented obstructive coronary artery disease. MINOCA was defined according to guidelines. For each patient we collected clinical, ECG and echocardiographic data recorded at initial evaluation. Overall, 36 patients had MINOCA during a follow-up period of 4.5 ± 11.2 years. MINOCA occurred in 16 patients with HCM (0.5%) and 20 patients with FD (7.5%; p &lt; 0.001). The difference between the 2 groups was highly significant, also after adjustment for the main clinical, ECG and echocardiographic variables (OR 6.12; 95%CI 2.80-13.3; p &lt; 0.001). In the FD population MINOCA occurred in 17 out of 96 patients with left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH, 17.7%) and in 3 out of 171 patients without LVH (1.7%; OR 12.0; 95%CI 3.43-42.3; p &lt; 0.001).

No major significant differences were found in clinical, ECG and echocardiographic findings between HCM patients with or without MINOCA. MINOCA was rare in HCM patients, and 6-fold more frequent in FD patients. MINOCA may be considered a red flag for FD and aid in the differential diagnosis from HCM."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal disorder that causes accumulation of glycosphingolipids in body fluids and tissues, leading to progressive organ damage and reduced life expectancy. It can affect both males and females and can be classified into classic or later-onset phenotypes. In classic Fabry disease, α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity is absent or severely reduced and disease manifestations have an early onset that can affect multiple organs. In contrast, in later-onset Fabry disease, patients have residual α-Gal A activity and clinical features are primarily confined to the heart. Individualized therapeutic goals in Fabry disease are required due to varying phenotypes and patient characteristics, and the wide spectrum of disease severity. An international group of expert physicians convened to discuss and develop practical clinical recommendations for disease- and organ-specific therapeutic goals in Fabry disease, based on expert consensus and evidence identified through a structured literature review. Biomarkers reflecting involvement of various organs in adult patients with classic Fabry disease are discussed and consensus recommendations for disease- and organ-specific therapeutic goals are provided. These consensus recommendations should support the establishment of individualized approaches to the management of patients with classic Fabry disease by considering identification, diagnosis, and initiation of disease-specific therapies before significant organ involvement, as well as routine monitoring, to reduce morbidity, optimize patient care, and improve patient health-related quality of life."

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current classifications of HF categorize patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% or greater as HF with preserved ejection fraction or HFpEF. Echocardiography is the first line imaging modality in assessing diastolic function given its practicality, low cost and the utilization of Doppler imaging. However, the last decade has seen cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) emerge as a valuable test for the sometimes challenging diagnosis of HFpEF. The unique ability of CMR for myocardial tissue characterization coupled with high resolution imaging provides additional information to echocardiography that may help in phenotyping HFpEF and provide prognostication for patients with HF. The precision and accuracy of CMR underlies its use in clinical trials for the assessment of novel and repurposed drugs in HFpEF. Importantly, CMR has powerful diagnostic utility in differentiating acquired and inherited heart muscle diseases presenting as HFpEF such as Fabry disease and amyloidosis with specific treatment options to reverse or halt disease progression. This state of the art review will outline established CMR techniques such as transmitral velocities and strain imaging of the left ventricle and left atrium in assessing diastolic function and their clinical application to HFpEF. Furthermore, it will include a discussion on novel methods and future developments such as stress CMR and MR spectroscopy to assess myocardial energetics, which show promise in unraveling the mechanisms behind HFpEF that may provide targets for much needed therapeutic interventions."

Although there is great variability in the age of onset of hCSVD patients, the age of onset younger than 45 years old is an important indicator. The primary clinical manifestations exhibit cognitive impairment, movement disorder, psychological disturbance, and most of which are accompanied by impairment of extra-neurological systems. The main radiological and pathological features of hCVSD include lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperdensities, cerebral microbleeds and enlargement of Virchow-Robin spaces. Current representative diseases include autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, HTRA1 related autosomal dominant cerebellar small vessel disease, collagen 4A1/2 microangiopathy, retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic manifestations, hereditary cerebral amyloidosis angiopathy, and Fabry disease. In recent years, Chinese scholars have summarized diagnostic, and treatment processes in hCSVD patients. Therefore, we organize experts engaged in the studies of hCVSD, based on the Chinese reports and referring to the relevant foreign literatures, to put forward clinical working recommendations for clinical and imaging characteristics, as well as diagnosis and treatment workflows of different types of hCVSD. The aim of this recommendation is to guide physicians to recognize hCVSD patients from those of stroke in order to obtain timely diagnosis and standard treatment."

Nevertheless, knowledge about the degree and extension of macro-scale brain connectivity modifications is to date missing. In this work, we performed connectomic analyses of diffusion and resting-state functional MRI to investigate changes of both structural and functional brain organization in Fabry disease, as well as to explore the relationship between the two and their clinical correlates. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 46 patients with Fabry disease (28F, 42.2 ± 13.2years) and 49 healthy controls (21F, 42.3 ± 16.3years) were included. All subjects underwent an MRI examination including anatomical, diffusion and resting-state functional sequences. Images were processed to obtain quantitative structural and functional connectomes, where the connections between regions of interest were weighted by the total intra-axonal signal contribution of the corresponding bundle and by the correlation between blood-oxygen level-dependent time series, respectively. We explored between-group differences in terms of both global network properties, expressed with graph measures and specific connected subnetworks, identified using a network-based statistics approach. As exploratory analyses, we also investigated the possible association between cognitive performance and structural and functional connectome modifications at both global and subnetwork level in a subgroup of patients (<i>n</i> = 11). Compared with healthy controls, patients with Fabry disease showed a significantly reduced global efficiency (<i>P</i> = 0.005) and mean strength (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in structural connectomes, together with an increased modularity (<i>P</i> = 0.005) in functional networks. As for the network-based statistics analysis, a subnetwork with decreased structural connectivity in patients with Fabry disease compared with healthy controls emerged, with eight nodes mainly located at the level of frontal or deep grey-matter areas. When probing the relation between altered global network metrics and neuropsychological tests, correlations emerged between the structural and functional disruption with results at verbal and working memory tests, respectively. Furthermore, structural disruption at subnetwork level was associated with worse executive functioning, with a significant moderation effect of functional changes suggesting a compensation mechanism. Taken together, these results further expand the current knowledge about brain involvement in Fabry disease, showing widespread structural disconnection and functional reorganization, primarily sustained by loss in axonal integrity and correlating with cognitive performance."

As a follow-up to our recent finding of the co-regulation of <i>GLA</i> and <i>HNRNPH2</i> via a bidirectional promoter (BDP) in normal kidney and skin cells, the potential accumulative influence of BDP methylation and <i>GLA</i> mutation on the severity of FD in patients from the same family, two males and two females carrying a <i>GLA</i> deletion mutation, c.1033_1034delTC (p.Ser345Argfs) was addressed in the present study.

The accumulative effects of the mutation and BDP methylation with the severity of the disease were observed in three patients.

In addition, patients with Fabry disease and no LVH [phenotype-negative carriers of pathogenic α-galactosidase gene mutations (GLA LVH-)] (n = 28) were compared with age and sex-matched carriers of sarcomeric gene mutations without LVH [Phenotype-negative carriers of pathogenic sarcomeric gene mutations (Sarc LVH-)] (n = 56). Standard echocardiography and 2D-STE were performed in all participants. Despite a subtle impairment of RV global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS) was common in both groups, patients with FC showed a more prominent reduction of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RV-FWS) and lower values of difference between RV-FWS and RV-GLS (ΔRV strain), in comparison to individuals with HCM (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). RV-FWS and ΔRV strain demonstrated an independent and additive value in discriminating FC from HCM, over the presence of symmetric LVH, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and RV hypertrophy. Similar results were found in GLA LVH- patients: they had worse RV-FWS and lower values of ΔRV strain as compared to Sarc LVH- patients (both P < 0.001). Patients with FC show a specific pattern of RV myocardial mechanics, characterized by a larger impairment of RV-FWS and lower ΔRV strain in comparison to patients with HCM, which may be helpful in the differential diagnosis between these two diseases."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disease causing progressive loss of target organ function. All renal cell types are involved from the early stages, even before clinical signs can be detected. FD-specific therapies can stop/mitigate disease progression. Thus, it is important to validate early markers of renal lesions so that they can be adopted as criteria for timely treatment initiation. We retrospectively analyzed and extensively evaluated 21 FD case patients; this evaluation included a kidney biopsy. We looked for the influence of pathological findings on the management of FD patients. In addition, we investigated the association between general and FD-specific features and long-term patients' outcomes. We defined a combined endpoint as being at least one of the following: 50% decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline, kidney failure (KF), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), or death and mortality. Our cohort of 21 FD patients (11 males and 10 females) was stratified according to the presence of the combined endpoint: group 1 (<i>n</i> = 15) included patients without the combined endpoint, while group 2 (<i>n</i> = 6) patients reached the combined endpoint outcome. Patients from group 2 presented lower mean baseline eGFR (72.2 ± 38.7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> vs. 82.5 ± 26.4 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) without statistical significance (<i>p</i> = 0.44), but significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.22) higher median baseline proteinuria (2.7 g/24 h vs. 0.4 g/24 h). Specific lysosomal deposits were identified in all patients. Segmental sclerosis was present in all patients with the combined endpoint and in only 33% of patients without the combined endpoint (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Global sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis were present in both groups, with no significant differences. A total of 15 out of the 16 treatment-naïve patients (7 males and 9 females) started FD-specific therapy after kidney biopsy. Treatment was initiated in all male FD patients and in 8 female patients. In 2 females, pathological findings in kidney biopsy offered important reasons to start FD treatment, although specific criteria of the Romanian protocol for prescription of FD-specific therapy were still not fulfilled. Cox univariate analysis showed that every increase in 24 h proteinuria with 1 g is associated with a 65% risk of developing the combined endpoint (HR = 1.65; 95%CI: 1.05-2.58; <i>p</i> = 0.02), and that the presence of segmental sclerosis increased the risk of developing the combined endpoint by 51.3 times (HR = 51.3; 95% CI: 95% CI: 1.67-103.5; <i>p</i> = 0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative risk of developing the combined endpoint was higher in patients in whom segmental sclerosis (100% vs. 0%, log-rank test, <i>p</i> = 0.03) was present. Histological evaluation is an important tool for the detection of early kidney involvement and provides additional support to the early initiation of FD-specific therapy. Presence of segmental sclerosis can predict the long-term outcomes of kidney disease deterioration and mortality and may be used as an early indicator of disease progression. Additionally, in the absence of other criteria according to current guidelines, specific FD renal lesions as revealed by kidney biopsy might become a distinct criterion to initiate FD therapy."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked, lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-galactosidase gene and characterized by neurological, cutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, cochleo-vestibular and ocular manifestations. The aim of this study is to characterize morphological, functional and autophagy-lysosome pathway alterations of the ocular surface in FD patients. Eleven subjects with a diagnosis of FD and fifteen healthy control subjects were examined. All patients underwent ocular surface slit lamp examination, corneal aesthesiometry and in vivo confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CCM). Conjunctival impression cytology was performed in six FD patients and six controls, to assess for expression of two markers of the autophagy-lysosome pathway: the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Cornea verticillata and increased conjunctival vessel tortuosity were detected respectively in 67% and 33% of patients with FD. Compared with healthy subjects, patients affected by FD showed a significant reduction in corneal nerve fiber length, density and nerve branching on CCM and a significantly increased expression of LC3 on conjunctival impression cytology (p < 0.001). No changes were observed in the conjunctival expression of LAMP2 between the two groups. This study shows that FD is associated with ocular surface alterations including corneal and conjunctival morphology, innervation and vascularization changes. Our data demonstrate an increased expression of LC3 protein in patients with FD, suggesting that alteration of the autophagy-lysosome pathway may play a role in the occurrence of ocular manifestations."

    "abstract": "The deficiency or absence of the lysosomal hydrolase α-Galactosidase A results in Fabry disease (FD), a rare and underdiagnosed X-linked disorder. The symptoms caused by FD have a direct relation with the variant present in the gene coding α-Galactosidase A (GLA) and enzyme residual activity, and it can vary drastically between men and women of the same family. Here, we present four novel variants found in patients with suspicion of FD. The patients were screened for FD by enzymatic activity and/or DNA sequencing, which showed four novel GLA missense variants. To confirm the potential pathogenicity of these variants, we employed site-directed mutagenesis. GLA wild-type and mutant plasmids were transfected into mammalian cells; RNA and proteins were extracted for expression and enzymatic activity analysis. The patients presented the variants p.Ile133Asn, p.Lys140Thr, p.Lys168Gln and p.Pro323Thr in the GLA. In vitro analysis showed pathogenic potential of three variants and one tolerated variant. The variants p.Ile133Asn and p.Lys168Gln showed no residual activity and, therefore, leading to classical phenotype, and the variant p.Lys140Thr, which presented 22% of residual activity, was considered a mild variant leading to non-classical phenotype. The variant p.Pro323Thr presented 66.7% of residual activity and alone, it is not enough to cause FD."

    "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine is an effective and widely used treatment in multiple autoimmune connective tissue diseases that gained a lot of publicity in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our case reports are unique in that they explore the rare and sometimes overlooked effects of this drug on multiple organ systems, specifically the kidney, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle. We include key histologic features in images which aid in identifying and distinguishing hydroxychloroquine toxicity from mimickers. Lastly, we report the very interesting similarity in the intracellular action of hydroxychloroquine to the pathology of Fabry disease (and its associated lysosomal enzyme, <i>α</i>-galactosidase A). <i>Case Presentation</i>. We will examine the case presentations of three female Caucasian patients: a 22-year-old with lupus nephritis class V, a 72-year-old with long-standing systemic lupus erythematosus, and a 74-year-old with undifferentiated connective tissue disease. All three patients were on hydroxychloroquine therapy for varying amounts of time with histologic evidence of hydroxychloroquine toxicity that is three is present in histological samples of the kidney, the heart, and the skeletal muscle. Hydroxychloroquine is a very important and beneficial medication used for various autoimmune connective tissue diseases. Clinicians should be aware of the rare but sometimes serious side effects that can result from the medication, which at times can mimic manifestations of the connective tissue disease itself or Fabry disease. A thorough investigation should be performed in these cases to properly elucidate the cause followed by the appropriate targeted therapy."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a lysosomal disorder caused by a deficiency in α-galactosidase A. Heterozygous female patients remain free of serious complications, including cardiovascular symptoms, until late in life. This often makes it difficult to decide on the best time to initiate treatment in female patients. Still, it is important to initiate treatment before the disease progresses too far. We report the case of a 39-year-old asymptomatic female patient with Fabry disease [heterozygous p.Arg301Pro (c.902 G>C) variant in the 6th exon of α-galactosidase A (NM_000169.3)]. After 8 years of follow-up, increased QRS voltage and strain T waves developed in the left precordial electrocardiogram leads in the absence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia. Echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and coronary angiography showed normal findings. Through endomyocardial biopsy, the patient was ultimately diagnosed with early stage cardiac involvement of her Fabry disease, and chaperon therapy was initiated. Follow-up after one year revealed reduction of both the electrocardiogram abnormality and microalbuminuria, suggesting disease progression was halted. This case highlights importance of prompt diagnosis of asymptomatic Fabry disease through endomyocardial biopsy as well as the potential benefit of chaperon therapy."

    "abstract": "Alport syndrome is a hereditary kidney disease characterized by hematuria and proteinuria. Although there have been reports of autosomal dominant COL4A4 variants, this is likely an underdiagnosed condition. Improved access to affordable genetic testing has increased the diagnosis of Alport syndrome. As genetic testing becomes ubiquitous, it is imperative that clinical nephrologists understand the benefits and challenges associated with clinical genetic testing. We present a family of Mexican descent with a heterozygous COL4A4 variant (c.5007delC, ClinVar accession numbers: SCV001580980.2, SCV001993731.1) not previously discussed in detail in the literature. The proband received a biopsy diagnosis suggestive of Fabry disease 18 years after she first developed hematuria and progressed to chronic kidney disease stage III. One year later, the proband was provisionally diagnosed with Alport syndrome after a variant of uncertain significance in the COL4A4 gene was identified following targeted family variant testing of her daughter. Upon review of the medical histories of the proband's children and niece, all but one had the same variant. Of the four with the variant, three display clinical symptoms of hematuria, and/or proteinuria. The youngest of the four, only months old, has yet to exhibit clinical symptoms. Despite these findings there was a considerable delay in synthesizing this data, as patients were tested in different commercial genetic testing laboratories. Subsequently, understanding this family's inheritance pattern, family history, and clinical symptoms, as well as the location of the COL4A4 variant resulted in the upgrade of the variant's classification. Although the classification of this variant varied among different clinical genetic testing laboratories, the consensus was that this variant is likely pathogenic. This COL4A4 variant (c.5007delC) not yet discussed in detail in the literature is associated with Alport syndrome. The inheritance pattern is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. This report highlights the intricacies of variant interpretation and classification, the siloed nature of commercial genetic testing laboratories, and the importance of a thorough family history for proper variant interpretation. Additionally, the cases demonstrate the varied clinical presentations of Alport syndrome and suggest the utility of early screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment."

    "title": "Burden associated with Fabry disease and its treatment in 12-15 year olds: results from a European survey.",
    "abstract": "Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare X-linked metabolic lysosomal disorder. FD has a broad range of symptoms which vary markedly between patients. The heterogenous nature of the disease makes diagnosis difficult for health care professionals (HCPs), which in turn has a significant effect on the patient's quality of life (QoL). As few adolescent patients are eligible for treatment, to date there has been little published data on the burden of disease and impact of treatment on these patients and their caregivers. This study was developed to provide some insight into these groups. An online-based survey was performed to gather further insights on the burden of FD in 14 adolescents aged 12-15 years old across three European countries, from the perspective of the patients, caregivers and HCPs. Symptom burden was found to be high in the adolescent population, with 'pain' and 'intolerance to heat or cold' commonly reported symptoms, both by patients and to HCPs. Eleven of the 14 patients surveyed were receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), with their post-ERT symptomology showing improvement when compared to symptoms before receiving ERT. The majority of caregivers believe their child's overall health has improved since starting ERT. While there was a positive outlook towards ERT noted by the patients and caregivers, 4/5 HCPs believed there is 'a need for more efficacious treatment options' and all HCPs noted that there is 'a need for more manageable treatment options'. FD was shown to place a burden on caregivers, who reported feelings of guilt and absences from work. Data show there is a significant symptom burden for the adolescent, which affects their QoL and mental health, as well as placing a burden on the wider family. While ERT is an effective treatment and provides symptom relief for many of the respondents in the survey, they still reported symptom burden. Additionally, there was reporting of reluctance to engage in treatment or difficulties associated with the treatment. Heterogeneity in symptom presentation suggests that the treatment regimen needs to be tailored to the individual. Physicians therefore need to have a choice of treatment options available to help them manage symptoms and disease where the benefit to risk ratio is in favour of undergoing treatment."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder that leads to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), frequently misdiagnosed as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We sought to assess the value of electrocardiography for distinguishing FD from HCM. We retrospectively reviewed and compared standard electrocardiograms and echocardiograms from 26 patients with FD and LVH and 33 sarcomeric patients with HCM, matched for gender, age, and degree of LVH. The mean age of patients with FD was 46 years (interquartile range) (28 to 53) and of HCM 50 (30 to 61) years (p = 0.27). Of them, 16 (61%) and 25 (76%) were male, respectively (p = 0.26). Indexed left ventricular mass was 166 g/m<sup>2</sup> in FD versus 181 g/m<sup>2</sup> in HCM (p = 0.88). All patients with FD and 30 (91%) with HCM were in sinus rhythm (p = 0.25). A higher prevalence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) was observed in FD (27%) versus HCM (6%) (p = 0.03). The PR interval was shorter in FD, 140 ms (120-160) versus 160 ms (140 to 180) (p = 0.004). P-wave duration was longer in patients with FD, 100 ms (80 to 120) versus 80 ms (80 to 100) (p = 0.01). The PQ interval (PR interval minus P-wave duration) was shorter in patients with FD, 40 ms (20 to 45) versus 80 ms (40 to 80) (p = 0.001). There were no differences regarding P-wave amplitude, QRS complex duration, corrected QT length, conduction or repolarization abnormalities, Sokolow-Lyon index, and Cornell index. After multivariate adjustments for RBBB, PR interval, P-wave duration, and PQ interval, a PQ interval ≤40 ms and RBBB were significantly associated with FD. In conclusion, there are electrocardiogram characteristics, such as the presence of RBBB or a PQ interval ≤40 ms, that may be helpful for screening and reducing the delay in FD diagnosis."

Purpose To evaluate the impact of cardiac MRI T1 and T2 mapping in routine clinical practice with respect to diagnostic accuracy, reader diagnostic confidence, and downstream cardiac imaging utilization. Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center study, consecutive clinical cardiac MRI scans obtained with and without T1 and T2 mapping for evaluation of suspected cardiomyopathy between January 2017 and October 2019 were evaluated. Diagnostic accuracy and reader diagnostic confidence were evaluated in a random subset. Downstream cardiac imaging utilization was analyzed in patients with a minimum of 1 year of clinical follow-up ending before January 2020. Results A total of 1876 patients (mean age, 51 years ± 17 [SD]; 1113 men) were evaluated. Of these, 751 (40%) underwent cardiac MRI with the core protocol and 1125 (60%) with the core protocol plus T1 and T2 mapping. In the mapping group, T1 and T2 were high in 280 (25%) and 47 patients (4%), respectively. In the subset evaluated for diagnostic utility (<i>n</i> = 450), the addition of T1 and T2 maps to the core protocol resulted in an improvement in reader diagnostic confidence in 174 patients (39%). Diagnostic sensitivity was higher with the core protocol plus mapping compared with the core protocol alone for myocarditis (89% [31 of 35 patients] vs 69% [24 of 35]; <i>P</i> = .008), Fabry disease (93% [13 of 14 patients] vs 50% [seven of 14]; <i>P</i> = .01), and amyloidosis (100% [16 of 16 patients] vs 63% [10 of 16]; <i>P</i> = .01). In the subset evaluated for downstream imaging utilization (<i>n</i> = 903), 47% of patients with mapping had at least one subsequent cardiac imaging test compared with 55% of patients without mapping (<i>P</i> = .01). Conclusion In patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, cardiac MRI with T1 and T2 mapping had high diagnostic utility and was associated with lower downstream cardiac imaging utilization. © RSNA, 2022 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article</i>.

    "abstract": "The use of available treatments for Fabry disease (FD) (including enzyme replacement therapy [ERT]) may be restricted by their limited symptom improvement and mode of administration. Lucerastat is currently being investigated in the MODIFY study as oral substrate reduction therapy for the treatment of FD. By reducing the net globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) load in tissues, lucerastat has disease-modifying potential to improve symptoms and delay disease progression. MODIFY is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 study (ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT03425539); here we present the rationale and design of this study. Eligible adults with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of FD and FD-specific neuropathic pain entered screening. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either oral lucerastat twice daily or placebo for 6 months; treatment allocation was stratified according to sex and ERT treatment status. The main objectives of MODIFY are to assess the effects of lucerastat on neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, FD biomarkers, and determine its safety and tolerability. Neuropathic pain and GI symptoms are key features of FD that have a significant impact on quality of life. Despite various tools available to assess pain and GI symptoms, there are currently limited tools available to assess neuropathic and GI symptoms in FD, validated according to health authority guidelines. Based on FDA recommendations, we undertook a patient-reported outcome (PRO) validation study, using a novel eDiary-based PRO tool to assess the validity of evaluating neuropathic pain as a primary efficacy endpoint in MODIFY. Results from the PRO validation study are included. To date, MODIFY is the largest Phase 3 clinical study conducted in patients with FD. Enrollment to MODIFY is now complete, with 118 patients randomized. Results will be presented in a separate publication. Long-term effects of lucerastat are being assessed in the ongoing open-label extension study (NCT03737214)."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that begins in childhood with a wide variety of symptoms, including neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and skin abnormalities. Despite the substantial impact of these symptoms on children's quality of life (QOL), systematic QOL analysis of Japanese pediatric Fabry disease patients has been limited. Therefore, to evaluate the QOL of Japanese pediatric Fabry disease patients using standardized and disease-specific scales, we used the Fabry-specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire (FPHPQ), which was developed by the Fabry Outcome Survey. The FPHPQ was translated in accordance with the Principles of Good Practice for the Translation and Cultural Adaptation Process for Patient-Reported Outcomes. A back-translated version was reviewed twice by the original lead author of FPHPQ to confirm the conceptual equivalence. The questionnaire was then validated by cognitive debriefing, and distributed to pediatric Fabry disease patients in Japan. Questionnaire responses were obtained from eight patients. The mean scores on the FPHPQ were 11.0 (± 11.43) for heat-associated pain, 5.5 (± 4.60) for cold-associated pain, and 14.8 (± 5.97) for abdominal pain and fatigue. In addition, heat-associated pain negatively correlated with physical well-being, whereas cold-associated pain positively correlated with good friendships. We established the Japanese version of the FPHPQ to assess the QOL of pediatric Fabry disease patients. The internal consistency and partial criterion-related validity of the Japanese version were confirmed. Analysis of a larger number of patients should be performed in the future to further validate the outcomes of this study."

    "abstract": "Fabry disease is a glycosphingolipid storage disorder that is caused by a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (AGA, EC 3.2.1.22). As a result, the glycolipid substrate, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulates in various cell types throughout the body producing a multisystem disease that affects the vascular, cardiac, renal, and nervous systems. A hallmark of this disorder is neuropathic pain that occurs in up to 80% of Fabry patients and has been characterized as a small fiber neuropathy. The molecular mechanism by which changes in AGA activity produce neuropathic pain is not clear, in part due to a lack of relevant model systems. Using 50B11 cells, an immortalized dorsal root ganglion neuron with nociceptive characteristics derived from rat, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of the galactosidase alpha (<i>GLA</i>) gene for AGA to create two stable knock-out clones that have the phenotypic characteristics of Fabry cells. The cell lines show severely reduced lysosomal AGA activity in homogenates as well as impaired degradation of Gb3 in cultured cells. This phenotype is stable over long-term culture. Similar to the unedited 50B11 cell line, the clones differentiate in response to forskolin and extend neurites. Flow cytometry experiments demonstrate that the gene-edited cells express TRPV1 pain receptor at increased levels compared to control, suggesting a possible mechanism for increased pain sensitization in Fabry patients. Our 50B11 cell lines show phenotypic characteristics of Fabry disease and grow well under standard cell culture conditions. These cell lines can provide a convenient model system to help elucidate the molecular mechanism of pain in Fabry patients."

Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder causing the accumulation of glycosphingolipids into various organs, including the heart, which can be detected by native T1 values in T1 mapping. However, there is no report for the systematic evaluation of native T1 values in Fabry disease in Japan. We analyzed native T1 values of 30 Fabry disease patients (14 males and 16 females) obtained by 3-T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Averaged T1 values were significantly lower in male patients (septal T1: 1149.5 ± 63.3 ms; total T1: 1145.1 ± 59.5 ms) than in female patients (septal T1: 1210.5 ± 45.5 ms; total T1: 1198.8 ± 51.8 ms) (<i>p</i> < 0.01). We compared the native T1 values of Fabry disease patients with those obtained from 15 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients (9 males and 6 females). Native T1 values effectively differentiate Fabry disease from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (septal T1: sensitivity 93.3% and specificity 80.0%; total T1: sensitivity 86.7% and specificity 73.3%). In addition, native T1 values had a significant negative correlation with the left ventricular mass index in male patients at the pre-hypertrophic stage (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In male and female patients without late-gadolinium enhancement, native T1 values also had a significant negative correlation with the left ventricular mass index (p < 0.05). These results suggest that native T1 values can be used to discriminate Fabry disease from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and can reflect the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in cardiomyocytes."

In 61/104, titre of serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured and SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was performed in symptomatic patients or in case of positivity of other family members. The symptoms and duration of COVID-19 were reported by the patients or the treating physician. No deaths or intensive care unit hospitalizations occurred. 13/104 (12.5%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (16.7% (4/24) men 12.2% (6/49) women of classic phenotype, 25% (3/12) of the men and 0% (0/8) of the women of later- onset phenotype).

    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene for <i>α</i>-galactosidase A, inducing a progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GB3) and its metabolites in different organs and tissues. GB3 deposition does not fully explain the clinical manifestations of FD, and other pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed, requiring the identification of new biomarkers for monitoring FD patients. Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of mitochondrial alterations in FD. Here, we propose mitochondrial-related microRNAs (miRs) as potential biomarkers of mitochondrial involvement in FD. Indeed, we demonstate that miRs regulating different aspects of mitochondrial homeostasis including expression and assembly of respiratory chain, mitogenesis, antioxidant capacity, and apoptosis are consistently dysregulated in FD patients. Our data unveil a novel noncoding RNA signature of FD patients, indicating mitochondrial-related miRs as new potential pathogenic players and biomarkers in FD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrates for the first time that a specific signature of circulating mitochondrial miRs (mitomiRs) is dysregulated in FD patients. MitomiRs regulating fundamental aspects of mitochondrial homeostasis and fitness, including expression and assembly of the respiratory chain, mitogenesis, antioxidant capacity, and apoptosis are significantly dysregulated in FD patients. Taken together, these new findings introduce mitomiRs as unprecedented biomarkers of FD and point at mitochondrial dysfunction as a novel potential mechanistic target for therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Simple renal cysts are a common finding during abdominal imaging assessment. The incidence increases with age and it is higher in male gender. Parapelvic cysts are a subset of simple cysts that arise within the renal parenchyma, adjacent to the renal sinus, characterized by being generally single, larger, and incompletely surrounded by renal parenchyma. Noteworthy, parapelvic cysts are a rare and understudied condition which, although considered clinically insignificant due to the absence of influence on renal function, still have a controversial aetiopathogenesis. On the other hand, urological management and differential diagnosis have been thoroughly investigated. The aim of our review is to provide an overall vision on this rare condition, usually misdiagnosed and underestimated, on the basis of more recent data. An accurate differential diagnosis of parapelvic cysts can lead to the identification of treatable conditions such as Fabry disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, polycystic liver disease and tuberous sclerosis complex disease."

After dual-chamber pacemaker implantation, interrogation revealed frequent right ventricular (RV) pacing with a wide QRS duration. The patient developed heart failure symptoms with rapid deterioration of LV systolic function. Pacing-induced cardiomyopathy (PICM) was suspected, and the pacemaker was upgraded to biventricular pacing. Further FD surveys were performed, including biochemical examinations, cardiac biopsies, and genetic sequencing, and the patient was ultimately diagnosed with a cardiac variant of FD. Particularly, we strongly suggest that physiologic pacing should be initially considered for patients with FD who have symptomatic high-grade AV block, rather than traditional RV pacing to prevent PICM."

    "title": "Pulvinar Sign, Stroke and Their Relationship with Fabry Disease: A Systematic Review and Metanalysis.",
    "abstract": "Background: Fabry disease (FD) is the second most common lysosomal storage disorder. This disorder affects multiple systems that include the cardiac, renal, and nervous system. The pulvinar sign (PS) is a relatively common sign seen in patients with FD. The PS is a bilateral, symmetrical pulvinar high signal relative to the signal intensity seen on unenhanced T1-weighted brain MR imaging. Methods: We conducted a systematic review with metanalysis to analyze the pool prevalence of the disorder. We used the Moose Guidelines and PRISMA Protocol for this systematic review and Robins 1 to access the BIAS of the study. To analyze the pool prevalence, we used “Open Meta-Analysis” software for analyzing the study. We used “Review Manager 5.4” to analyze the odds ratio between patients with and without the PS and patients with and without stroke among patients with FD. Results: We gather 12 studies from 2003 to 2021 for the analysis of this study. The pool prevalence of the study was 0.146 (0.076−0.217) (62/385 cases) with a 95% CI (0.0945−0.415) (p < 0.01). The prevalence was much higher in men (59 cases) than in women (3 cases). There was no relationship between the pulvinar sign and patients with stroke among patients with Fabry disease. Odds ratio 1.97 95% CI (0.35−11.21), p = 0.44; Tau2 = 0.77. There seems to be a correlation with renal failure (RF), but there were very few studies to conduct a metanalysis with RF. Conclusions: The prevalence of the PS among all studies was 23.9%; the prevalence of this sign is higher among males. We found that FD patients who had strokes did not have higher odds of presenting with the Pulvinar Sign than the FD patients who did not suffer a stroke. Patients with renal failure and FD seem to have a higher tendency to have the PS, but there were not enough studies to analyze that theory. Overall, we think the pulvinar sign has a poor prognostic value in patients with Fabry’s disease."

    "title": "Twenty years of the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS): insights, achievements, and lessons learned from a global patient registry.",
    "abstract": "Patient registries provide long-term, real-world evidence that aids the understanding of the natural history and progression of disease, and the effects of treatment on large patient populations with rare diseases. The year 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS), an international, multicenter, observational registry (NCT03289065). The primary aims of FOS are to broaden the understanding of Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, and to improve the clinical management of affected patients. Here, we review the history of FOS and the analyses and publications disseminated from the registry, and we discuss the contributions FOS studies have made in understanding FD. FOS was initiated in April 2001 and, as of January 2021, 4484 patients with a confirmed diagnosis and patient informed consent have been enrolled from 144 centers across 26 countries. Data from FOS have been published in nearly 60 manuscripts on a wide variety of topics relevant to FD. Analyses of FOS data have investigated the long-term effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alfa and its effects on morbidity and mortality, as well as the benefits of prompt and early treatment with agalsidase alfa on the progression of cardiomyopathy and the decline in renal function associated with FD. Based on analyses of FOS data, ERT with agalsidase alfa has also been shown to improve additional signs and symptoms of FD experienced by patients. FOS data analyses have provided a better understanding of the natural history of FD and the specific populations of women, children, and the elderly, and have provided practical tools for the study of FD. FOS has also provided methodology and criteria for assessing disease severity which contributed to the continuous development of medical practice in FD and has largely improved our understanding of the challenges and needs of long-term data collection in rare diseases, aiding in future rare disease real-world evidence studies. FOS over the last 20 years has substantially increased the scientific knowledge around improved patient management of FD and continues to expand our understanding of this rare disease."

    "title": "Identification and functional characterization of the first deep intronic GLA mutation (IVS4+1326C>T) causing renal variant of Fabry disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is an X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by the deficiency of α-galactosidase A (α-GalA), encoded by the GLA gene. Among more than 1100 reported GLA mutations, few were deep intronic mutations which have been linked to classic and cardiac variants of FD. We report a novel hemizygous deep intronic GLA mutation (IVS4+1326C>T) in a 33-year-old Chinese man with a mild α-GalA deficiency phenotype involving isolated proteinuria and predominant globotriaosylceramide deposits in podocytes. IVS4+1326C>T, which appears to be the first deep intronic GLA mutation associated with renal variant of FD, was identified by Sanger sequencing the entire GLA genomic DNA sequence of the patient's peripheral mononuclear blood lymphocytes (PBMCs). Further sequencing of cDNA from PBMCs of the patient revealed a minor full-length GLA transcript accounting for about 25% of total GLA transcript, along with two major aberrantly spliced GLA transcripts encoding mutant forms of α-GalA with little enzyme activity characterized by in vitro α-GalA overexpression system in the HEK293T cells. Thus, the combined clinical phenotype, genetic analysis and functional studies verified the pathogenicity of IVS4+1326C>T. The identification of IVS4+1326C>T establishes a link between deep intronic GLA mutation and the renal variant of FD, which extends the mutation spectrum in GLA gene and justifies further study of how IVS4+1326C>T and potentially other deep intronic GLA mutations contribute to Fabry podocytopathy through aberrant splicing. Future studies should also assess the true incidence of IVS4+1326C>T in patients with different variants of FD, which may improve early genetic diagnosis to allow timely treatment that can prevent disease progression and improve survival."

    "title": "Clinical Characteristics, Renal Involvement, and Therapeutic Options of Pediatric Patients With Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Inherited renal diseases represent 20% of the causes of end-stage renal diseases. Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, results from α-galactosidase A deficient or absent activity followed by globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation and multiorgan involvement. In Fabry disease, kidney involvement starts early, during intrauterine life by the Gb3 deposition. Even if chronic kidney disease (CKD) is discovered later in adult life in Fabry disease patients, a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can occur during adolescence. The first clinical sign of kidney involvement is represented by albuminuria. So, early and close monitoring of kidneys function is required: albuminuria and proteinuria, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, serum creatinine, or cystatin C to estimate GFR, while urinary sediment with phase-contrast microscopy under polarized light may be useful in those cases where leucocyte α-Gal A activity and <i>GLA</i> genotyping are not available. Children with Fabry disease and kidney involvement should receive enzyme replacement therapy and nephroprotective drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) to prevent or slow the progressive loss of kidney functions. Early diagnosis of Fabry disease is important as enzyme replacement therapy reduces symptoms, improves clinical features and biochemical markers, and the quality of life. More importantly, early treatment could slow or stop progressive organ damage in later life."

    "title": "Frequency Doubling Technology Visual Field Loss in Fabry Subjects Related to Retinal Ganglion Cell Function as Explored by ERG and OSOME.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate potential causes of FDT visual field loss in a selected group of Fabry subjects. This is a pilot observational study. Subjects were assessed during 2 visits. The following tests were performed: visual acuity, tonometry, optical coherence tomography (OCT) optic nerve scan, frequency doubling time (FDT) and threshold (SAP) VF, ERG, and Online Spectro-reflectometry Oxygenation Measurement in the Eye (OSOME). Results are compared across visits and, when indicated, interpreted against those collected on non-Fabry population matched for age and sex. The study population was composed of 3 males (34.3 ± 8.9 y.o.) and 5 females (46.4 ± 6.5 y.o). For all subjects, BCVA remained 6/6 OU throughout the study and OCT optic nerve scans were normal. FDT showed a defect in at least 1 quadrant for all participants, in contrast with SAP. FDT PSD value was found different vs SAP. For ERG, the i-wave (52.1 + 2.7 ms) and B-waves (31.6 ± 2.1 ms) peak times were significantly longer compared to a non-Fabry population (p < 0.05). Overall blood oxygenation varied from 61.3% ± 4% to 68.1% ± 4% at the second visit, suggesting a loss of capillary perfusion. Blood volume varied based on location (superior/inferior), eye tested (OD/OS) and time (visit 1/2). The range of values exceeds normal subjects findings (p < 0.05). Blood volume was correlated to FDT PSD value for the superior area of the optic nerve. The results suggest that Fabry subjects present FDT deficits and abnormal ERG patterns that may be explained by a retinal dysfunction affecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), second to vascular alterations."

    "title": "Identification of dual active sites in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> GANA-1 protein: an ortholog of the human α-GAL a and α-NAGA enzymes.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is caused by a defective α-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) enzyme responsible for breaking down globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>). To develop affordable therapeutics, more effort is needed to obtain insights into the underlying mechanism of FD and understanding human α-GAL A structure and function in related animal models. We adopted <i>C. elegans</i> as a model to elucidate the sequence and 3D structure of its GANA-1 enzyme and compared it to human α-GAL A. We constructed GANA-1 3D structure by homology modelling and validated the quality of the predicted GANA-1 structure, followed by computational docking of human ligands. The GANA-1 protein shared sequence similarities up to 42.1% with the human α-GAL A <i>in silico</i> and had dual active sites. GANA-1 homology modelling showed that 11 out of 13 amino acids in the first active site of GANA-1 protein overlapped with the human α-GAL A active site, indicating the prospect for substrate cross-reaction. Computational molecular docking using human ligands like Gb<sub>3</sub> (first pocket)<sub>,</sub> 4-nitrophenyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (second pocket), α-galactose (second pocket), and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (second pocket) showed negative binding energy. This revealed that the ligands were able to bind within both GANA-1 active sites, mimicking the human α-GAL A and α-NAGA enzymes. We identified human compounds with adequate docking scores, predicting robust interactions with the GANA-1 active site. Our data suggested that the <i>C. elegans</i> GANA-1 enzyme may possess structural and functional similarities to human α-GAL A, including an intrinsic capability to metabolize Gb<sub>3</sub> deposits.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

    "title": "Dysregulation of Immune Response Mediators and Pain-Related Ion Channels Is Associated with Pain-like Behavior in the GLA KO Mouse Model of Fabry Disease.",
    "abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare life-threatening disorder caused by deficiency of the alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) enzyme with a characteristic pain phenotype. Impaired GLA production or function leads to the accumulation of the cell membrane compound globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in the neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of FD patients. Applying immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) analysis on DRG tissue of the GLA knockout (KO) mouse model of FD, we address the question of how Gb3 accumulation may contribute to FD pain and focus on the immune system and pain-associated ion channel gene expression. We show a higher Gb3 load in the DRG of young (<6 months) (p < 0.01) and old (≥12 months) (p < 0.001) GLA KO mice compared to old wildtype (WT) littermates, and an overall suppressed immune response in the DRG of old GLA KO mice, represented by a reduced number of CD206+ macrophages (p < 0.01) and lower gene expression levels of the inflammation-associated targets interleukin(IL)1b (p < 0.05), IL10 (p < 0.001), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (p < 0.05), and leucine rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) (p < 0.01) in the DRG of old GLA KO mice compared to old WT. Dysregulation of immune-related genes may be linked to lower gene expression levels of the pain-associated ion channels calcium-activated potassium channel 3.1 (KCa3.1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 channel (TRPA1). Ion channel expression might further be disturbed by impaired sphingolipid recruitment mediated via the lipid raft marker flotillin-1 (FLOT1). This impairment is represented by an increased number of FLOT1+ DRG neurons with a membranous expression pattern in old GLA KO mice compared to young GLA KO, young WT, and old WT mice (p < 0.001 each). Further, we provide evidence for aberrant behavior of GLA KO mice, which might be linked to dysregulated ion channel gene expression levels and disturbed FLOT1 distribution patterns. Behavioral testing revealed mechanical hypersensitivity in young (p < 0.01) and old (p < 0.001) GLA KO mice compared to WT, heat hypersensitivity in young GLA KO mice (p < 0.001) compared to WT, age-dependent heat hyposensitivity in old GLA KO mice (p < 0.001) compared to young GLA KO mice, and cold hyposensitivity in young (p < 0.001) and old (p < 0.001) GLA KO mice compared to WT, which well reflects the clinical phenotype observed in FD patients."

    "title": "Late-onset Fabry disease: the cardiac sequela.",
    "abstract": "We describe a patient with Fabry disease (FD) who initially presented with atrial fibrillation without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) 14 years before being correctly diagnosed with FD. In the interim, he survived a myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation, and his severe LVH was misdiagnosed as sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the following 4 years, he developed proteinuric kidney disease, neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient was eventually readmitted for an overt heart failure (HF) exacerbation and was seen by an HF cardiologist. The constellation of systemic findings led to further diagnostic testing, including an endomyocardial biopsy, tests to determine alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity and α-galactosidase A gene (GLA) analysis. The results of the patient's tests were consistent with FD and he was started on enzyme replacement therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of a late-onset phenotype of FD with c.146 G>C GLA variant. In addition, this case serves as a potent reminder to pay meticulous attention to 'red flags' accompanying LVH."
