    "title": "Application of Fuzzy AHP for Medication Decision Making in Iron-Chelating Medications for Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Iron overload is a significant concern for patients with thalassemia and often necessitates the use of iron-chelating agents to mitigate the associated complications. Selecting the most appropriate chelation therapy from the available options is a complex decision for healthcare professionals. To support this decision-making process, this study investigates the application of the \"Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process\" (FAHP) for medication selection in thalassemia patients requiring iron-chelation therapy. In this study, 20 hematologists participated, and matrices related to the FAHP model were used to evaluate three primary iron chelators: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone. The results revealed that deferiprone was the most effective choice, while deferasirox outperformed the others in terms of cost and patient satisfaction. Notably, deferoxamine exhibits the highest rate of side effects, followed by deferiprone and deferasirox. The results obtained from the FAHP analysis indicated a consensus among experts and highlighted deferasirox as the optimal choice for treating chronic iron overload in thalassemia patients. The study demonstrates the practical applicability of the FAHP methodology in guiding informed decisions for iron-chelation therapy. It provides insights to help healthcare professionals optimize treatment strategies for patients with thalassemia."

    "title": "Role of Amide Proton Transfer Weighted MRI in Predicting MGMTp Methylation Status, p53-Status, Ki-67 Index, IDH-Status, and ATRX Expression in WHO Grade 4 High Grade Glioma.",
    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To assess amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) MR imaging capabilities in differentiating high-grade glial tumors across alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) expression, tumor-suppressor protein p53 expression (p53), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (MGMTp) methylation, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status, and proliferation marker Ki-67 (Ki-67 index) as a preoperative diagnostic aid. <b>Material & Methods:</b> A total of 42 high-grade glioma WHO grade 4 (HGG) patients were evaluated prospectively (30 males and 12 females). All patients were examined using conventional MRI, including the following: T1w-MPRAGE pre- and post-contrast administration, conventional T2w and 3D FLAIR, and APTw imaging with a 3T MR scanner. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for the APTw% mean, median, and max signal for the different molecular biomarkers. A logistic regression model was constructed for combined mean and median APTw% signals for p53 expression. <b>Results:</b> The whole-tumor max APTw% signal could significantly differentiate MGMTp from non-MGMTp HGG, <i>p</i> = 0.035. A cutoff of 4.28% max APTw% signal yielded AUC (area under the curve) = 0.702, with 70.6% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. The mean/median APTw% signals differed significantly in p53 normal versus p53-overexpressed HGG s: 1.81%/1.83% vs. 1.15%/1.18%, <i>p</i> = 0.002/0.006, respectively. Cutoffs of 1.25%/1.33% for the mean/median APTw% signals yielded AUCs of 0.786/0.757, sensitivities of 76.9%/76.9%, and specificities of 50%/66.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.002/0.006, respectively. A logistic regression model with a combined mean and median APTw% signal for p53 status yielded an AUC = 0.788 and 76.9% sensitivity and 66.2% specificity. ATRX-, IDH- wild type (wt) vs. mutation (mut), and the level of Ki-67 did not differ significantly, but trends were found: IDH-wt and low Ki-67 showed higher mean/median/max APTw% signals vs. IDH-mut and high Ki-67, respectively. ATRX-wt vs. mutation showed higher mean and median APTw% signals but lower max APTw% signal. <b>Conclusions</b>: APTw imaging can potentially be a useful marker for the stratification of p53 expression and MGMT status in high-grade glioma in the preoperative setting and potentially aid surgical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid detection technology is crucial for molecular diagnosis. The advent of CRISPR/Cas12a-based nucleic acid detection has considerably broadened its scope, from the identification of infectious disease-causing microorganisms to the detection of disease-associated biomarkers. This innovative system capitalizes on the non-specific single-strand cleavage activity of Cas12a upon target DNA recognition. By employing a fluorescent probe in the form of a single-stranded DNA/RNA, this technology enables the observation of fluorescence changes resulting from nonspecific cleavage, thereby facilitating detection. CRISPR/Cas12a-based detection systems can be regarded as a new type of biosensor, offering a practical and efficient approach for nucleic acid analysis in various diagnostic settings. CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensors outperform conventional nucleic acid detection methods in terms of portability, simplicity, speed, and efficiency. In this review, we elucidate the detection principle of CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensors and their application in disease diagnostics and discuss recent innovations and technological challenges, aiming to provide insights for the research and further development of CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensors in personalized medicine. Our findings show that although CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensors have considerable potential for various applications and theoretical research, certain challenges remain. These include simplifying the reaction process, enhancing precision, broadening the scope of disease detection, and facilitating the translation of research findings into clinical practice. We anticipate that ongoing advancements in CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensors will address these challenges."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) on quality of life and behavioral problems in children diagnosed with leukemia and β-thalassemia major, with a focus on post-transplant diagnosis-specific differences in psychosocial adjustment. This study included 112 children (63 children with acute leukemia, 49 children with β-thalassemia major) aged 6-18 years, along with a control group of 30 healthy children within the same age range. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 (CBCL) were administered. Participants were categorized into five groups, and the outcomes were compared accordingly. The emotional functioning subscale scores of the PedsQL were significantly lower in children with leukemia and those who had undergone HSCT for leukemia, when compared to children with thalassemia (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The social functioning subscale scores were also significantly lower in children with leukemia who underwent HSCT compared to those with thalassemia (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The CBCL internalizing scores were higher in children with leukemia and post-HSCT leukemia patients than in their healthy peers (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Over time, both diagnostic groups showed improvements, with total PedsQL scores increasing and total CBCL scores decreasing after HSCT. This study demonstrates that quality of life improved and behavioral problems diminished over time following HSCT. However, the psychosocial impact of HSCT varied depending on the underlying disease, with children diagnosed with leukemia being slightly more adversely affected. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving quality of life and addressing behavioral issues should be tailored to the specific diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT) is associated with chronic health problems. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Hong Kong Chinese patients to evaluate the presentation and complications of NTDT. One hundred and nine patients aged between 6.7 and 72.3 years (median: 32 years), including 97 with α-thalassaemia intermedia and 12 with β-thalassaemia intermedia, were included from two public hospitals. Among them, 82% had never been transfused and 18% had received sporadic transfusions. Chelation therapy had been given to 7% of patients. Notably, 52% of patients had chronic health deficits with a strong positive correlation with advanced age, log-transformed ferritin levels and history of splenectomy. Hepatic iron overload was detected in 43% of patients, and extramedullary haematopoiesis in 14%. At least one endocrinopathy developed in 12% of patients. Patients with non-deletional α-thalassaemia intermedia and β-thalassaemia intermedia exhibited more severe disease than those with deletional α-thalassaemia intermedia. This study highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring and management strategies for NTDT to mitigate chronic health issues and improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a highly prevalent genetic hemoglobinopathy, with approximately 350 million people worldwide carrying variants of the globin genes. The carrier rate in southern China is as high as 10% ~ 25%. The \"multi-level sequential screening and diagnosis\" approach, which uses hematological screening, hotspot mutation testing, and genetic testing based on other technologies to diagnose rare types of thalassemia, has proven to be highly effective for the prevention and control of thalassemia. However, its cumbersome process, high cost for testing and medical labor, and high demand for genetic consulting have obvious limitations. For its advantages of long reads and accurate identification of sequence variants, Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing technology can not only broaden the scope of globin gene mutation detection, but also directly distinguish the haplotypes and structural rearrangements of the α- and β-globin genes, significantly improving the detection rate, reducing false positives and missed detection, and has revolutionized the detection for genetic variants underlying thalassemia. With the maturity of technology and decrease in cost, the application of SMRT sequencing in the prevention and control of thalassemia is becoming increasingly widespread. So far more than 50 clinical studies and 300,000 clinical application data have been accumulated. Based on these evidence-based studies, this consensus has explored the application scope, workflow, and limitations of employing SMRT sequencing in clinical genetic testing for thalassemia. It aims to provide recommendations and guidance for clinicians, laboratory staff, and policy makers, to support precise prevention and control of thalassemia throughout the full life cycle."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia (βT) and α-thalassemia (αT) are chronic hemolytic anemias caused by hereditary defects in the β or α chains of hemoglobin respectively. According to the clinical picture, both forms of thalassemia are subdivided into minor, intermedia or major. Previous guidelines focused on growth and endocrine dysfunctions in βT major, where the complications reported are consequences of iron toxicity. However emerging evidence shows that patients with other forms of thalassemia are also at risk of some endocrinopathies. This guideline provides consensus on the screening and management of endocrine complications of children and adolescents with different forms of thalassemia. The panel has 14 experts from 13 countries representing 8 societies. They reviewed literature up to 2024 for the highest available evidence on the subject and 42 recommendations were modified until at least 70% vote for agreement was achieved. Hypogonadism, delayed growth and puberty are common in βT major and transfusion dependent (TD) αT HbH disease and they are also reported in βT intermedia and non-TD αT HbH disease. Osteopenia, adrenal insufficiency and reproductive dysfunction are reported only in βT major and TD αT HbH disease. In addition, hypothyroidism, diabetes and hypoparathyroidism are also reported in TD and non-TD thalassemia. Adherence to modern transfusion, and iron chelation can prevent or reverse endocrine complications. Regular screening should be conducted before the age of 10 years in patients with TD thalassemia, and from 11 years onwards in non-TD thalassemia. Those who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for βT major are at risk of endocrinopathies and should be managed similarly to individuals with TD thalassemia."

    "abstract": "To prospectively evaluate the accuracy and limitations of the 1.5 T 3D-Dixon sequence (qDixon) in quantifying liver iron concentration (LIC), using FerriScan technology-determined LIC and the 1.5 T multi-echo GRE sequence (ME-GRE) as reference standards. A total of 161 chronic transfusion-dependent patients, 83 men and 43 women with a mean age of 21.04 years, were scanned using ME-GRE and qDixon sequences; among them, 67 were scanned using FerriScan technology. R2* values (ME-GRE-R2* and qDixon-R2*) and LIC were obtained for both sequences. Comparative analysis was conducted using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC), Bland-Altman plots, and linear regression. A piecewise regression model was constructed to determine the upper limit for quantifying LIC using the qDixon. The qDixon-LIC and ME-GRE-LIC showed mean differences of 0.22, 0.01, -0.27, and 6.8 mg/g dry weight (dw) in normal, mild, moderate, and severe liver iron overload with corresponding CCC values of 0.986, 0.982, 0.956, and 0.216, respectively. The piecewise regression model established a 28.47 mg/g dw threshold for accurate liver iron quantification using qDixon, beyond which qDixon-R2* reached 892.86 s<sup>-1</sup>. Below this threshold, qDixon demonstrated a strong linear correlation with FerriScan in estimating LIC (r = 0.82, p < 0.001), with a negligible mean difference of 1.68 mg/g dw and a CCC of 0.984. The 1.5 T qDixon sequence can be used to quantitatively assess LIC within a specific range (LIC < 28.47 mg/g dw), simplifying clinical workflow procedures."

    "title": "Effect of Iron Overload on Bone Mineral Density in Patients with Transfusion-dependent Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Bone disease is an increasingly recognized complication in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). Multiple factors contribute to impaired bone metabolism, including bone marrow expansion, iron overload, chelation toxicity, calcium and vitamin D deficiencies, and endocrine disturbances, particularly hypogonadism. To evaluate the correlation between serum ferritin levels and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with TDT. This retrospective observational study was conducted at the Thalassemia Day Care Center of a tertiary care hospital in Punjab, India, from January to December 2022. All TDT patients aged >5 years who had undergone BMD assessment were included. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Z-scores were used for patients below 20 years, while T-scores were applied for those above 20 years. BMD results were categorized as normal, osteopenia, or osteoporosis. Anthropometric data (age, weight, and height), serum ferritin, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D levels were recorded and correlated with BMD. A total of 124 patients were included, with a mean age of 15.65 ± 9.09 years (range: 5-50 years). At the femoral neck, BMD was normal in 37%, osteopenic in 60%, and osteoporotic in 3.2% of patients. At the lumbar spine, normal BMD was observed in 20.9%, osteopenia in 61.2%, and osteoporosis in 17.7%. The 10-20 years age-group had the highest prevalence of bone loss (<i>p</i> = 0.099). Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis compared to those with osteopenia and normal BMD at both femoral neck (4 794.75 ± 2 637.82 vs 2 915.86 ± 1 360.20 vs 1 797.85 ± 1 304.89 ng/mL; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and lumbar spine (4 627.50 ± 1 282.97 vs 2 454.03 ± 1 116.80 vs 1 128.58 ± 702.83 ng/mL; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.873 (95% CI: 0.795-0.950), with a ferritin cutoff of 1918 ng/mL (sensitivity: 80.4%, specificity: 87.5%). The study revealed a substantial prevalence of low BMD among TDT patients, particularly at the lumbar spine. Elevated serum ferritin levels were strongly associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, indicating the impact of iron overload on bone health. Early and routine BMD assessments are recommended for timely identification and management of bone complications in this population."

    "title": "Plasma Glycolate Levels Contribute to Drive the Decision of Isolated Kidney Transplantation in Dialyzed Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease due to Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 Treated with Lumasiran: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is an inherited disease due to deficient activity of the liver enzyme AGT due to a mutation of the AGXT gene, leading to impairment in the glyoxylate metabolism with excessive oxalate urinary excretion (uOx) causing nephrolithiasis, renal failure, and systemic oxalosis. The historical treatment for renal failure was combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) to restore normal function of AGT enzyme, but in mutations fully responsive to pyridoxine, an isolated kidney transplant (IKT) is feasible. Recently, RNA-interference (RNAi) agents such as lumasiran that reduce the oxalate synthesis in PH1 patients open new therapeutic challenges such as IKT irrespective of the type of <i>AGXT</i> gene mutation. Nevertheless, to decide for IKT instead of CLKT, clinicians must be aware of lumasiran efficacy. At present, the biomarker used to evaluate the lumasiran efficacy is the plasma oxalate (pOx). However, in dialyzed patients, pOx might be influenced by the release of oxalate from the deposits to the blood. We report the case of a PH1 36-year-old male patient who underwent IKT combined with lumasiran. Two years after transplantation, graft function is good without lithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. 24-h uOx varies from 0.55 to 1.2 mmol/day and pOx remains stable at 12 μmol/L. Allograft biopsies at 1, 6, 12, and 22 months show negligible oxalate crystals deposits. The novelty of our case lies in the methods we adopted to evaluate the lumasiran efficacy during dialysis prior listing for IKT. Specifically, we decided to list the patient for IKT according to the high plasma levels of glycolate reached after lumasiran treatment together with the significant reduction of the pOx."

There were no significant difference in pancreatic segments R2* values within the subgroup of sex, heart iron degree, liver iron degree and pancreatic iron degree (all P > 0.05). There is a moderate correlation between the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of R2* values for each segment of the pancreas and the mean value of the pancreas (r = 0.683, P < 0.001; r = 0.411, P < 0.001), R2* values were no different among pancreatic segments in the extremely severe iron overload group (with three times R2* the pancreatic Oiron overload threshold). There were no significant differences in pancreatic iron deposition among the segments in NTDT, and R2* values for single-segment could be selected to assess the overall iron deposition of the pancreas."

    "abstract": "β-Thalassemia is a genetic disorder arising from mutations in the β-globin gene, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload. Ineffective erythropoiesis, a hallmark of β-thalassemia, is an important driver of iron overload, which contributes to liver fibrosis, diabetes, and cardiac disease. Iron homeostasis is regulated by the hormone hepcidin; BMP6/hemojuvelin-mediated (BMP6/HJV-mediated) signaling induces hepatic hepcidin expression via SMAD1/5, with transmembrane serine protease 6 (TMPRSS6) being a negative regulator of HJV. Individuals with loss-of-function mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene show increased circulating hepcidin and iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia, suggesting that blocking TMPRSS6 may be a viable strategy to elevate hepcidin levels in β-thalassemia. We generated a human mAb (REGN7999) that inhibits TMPRSS6. In an Hbbth3/+ mouse model of β-thalassemia, REGN7999 treatment led to significant reductions in liver iron, reduced ineffective erythropoiesis, and showed improvements in RBC health, running distance during forced exercise, and bone density. In a phase I, doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy human volunteers (NCT05481333), REGN7999 increased serum hepcidin and reduced serum iron with an acceptable tolerability profile. Our results suggest that, by both reducing iron and improving RBC function, inhibition of TMPRSS6 by REGN7999 may offer a therapy for iron overload and impaired erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) thalassaemia is characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolytic anaemia, leading to long-term complications, poor quality of life, and early mortality. No oral disease-modifying therapies are approved for β-thalassaemia and no agents are approved for α-thalassaemia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mitapivat, an oral activator of pyruvate kinase, in adults with NTD α-thalassaemia or NTD β-thalassaemia. ENERGIZE is a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial followed by an open-label extension conducted at 70 hospitals in 18 countries globally. Participants had to be aged 18 years or older with NTD α-thalassaemia or NTD β-thalassaemia and haemoglobin concentrations of 10 g/dL or lower. Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to mitapivat or placebo (100 mg orally twice a day for 24 weeks) via a central interactive response technology system using block randomisation, stratified by baseline haemoglobin concentration and thalassaemia genotype. Everyone was masked to the patients' treatment assignment until the study was unblinded for the analysis of the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint was haemoglobin response (≥1·0 g/dL increase from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration from week 12 through week 24), analysed in all patients who were randomly assigned. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04770753, and is active but not recruiting. Between Nov 8, 2021, and March 31, 2023, 235 patients were screened, of whom 194 were enrolled (123 [63%] were female and 71 [37%] were male). 130 patients were randomly assigned to mitapivat and 64 patients to placebo and formed the full analysis set. One patient in each group was randomly assigned but not given treatment and was therefore excluded from the safety analysis set (mitapivat 129 patients and placebo 63 patients). Seven patients in the mitapivat group and one patient in the placebo group discontinued treatment before the end of the 24-week double-blind period. 55 (42%) of 130 patients in the mitapivat group had a haemoglobin response versus one (2%) of 64 in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference 41% [95% CI 32-50], two-sided p<0·0001). Adverse events were reported in 107 (83%) of 129 patients who received mitapivat and 50 (79%) of 63 patients who received placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events with mitapivat were headache (29 [22%] of 129 patients in the mitapivat group vs six [10%] of 63 in the placebo group), initial insomnia (18 [14%] vs three [5%]), nausea (15 [12%] vs five [8%]), and upper respiratory tract infection (14 [11%] vs four [6%]). No deaths were reported. Mitapivat could be a new oral treatment for adults with NTD α-thalassaemia or NTD β-thalassaemia by increasing haemoglobin concentration and improving fatigue.

    "abstract": "Individuals with thalassemia or sickle cell disease (SCD) are at an elevated risk of developing cancer, yet the full extent of this risk remains inadequately characterised. We conducted a systematic review using three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus) to compare the cancer risk in patients with thalassemia and SCD with that of the general population. Secondly, we assessed the impact of other putative risk factors in patients with thalassemia and SCD on cancer risk. Five studies from four countries were included, encompassing a total of 24,439 individuals overall. The risk estimates of developing cancer were highly variable, being affected by study design, population and comparators recruited, and type of cancer. The results showed an elevated cancer risk in SCD and thalassemia patient groups, with the highest incidence observed for hematologic malignancies (especially myeloid leukaemia in SCD patients). Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia had a significantly higher overall cancer risk, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, compared to both non-transfusion-dependent patients and the general population. Other key factors seem to contribute to the increased cancer risk besides transfusion dependency, viral infections, and use of iron chelators. However, people with hemoglobinopathies appeared to be at lower risk of breast and prostate cancer compared to the general population. The findings are limited by variability among studies, including differences in control groups, inconsistent reporting of outcomes, and missing assessments of confounding factors. Therefore, future research with robust methods is essential to improve cancer surveillance and develop targeted prevention strategies for high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "The carrier rates of alpha- and beta-thalassemia are notably high in certain regions. Current screening methods using traditional mean corpuscular volume (MCV) measurements can prevent the birth of severe cases of thalassemia, but often miss carriers of mild forms, potentially leading to hemoglobin H disease or thalassemia in their offspring. This study aimed to demonstrate that genetic carrier screening using next-generation sequencing (NGS) enhances the detection of silent thalassemia carriers and explores its clinical feasibility for large-scale population screening to illustrate the prevalence and spectrum of thalassemia in Taiwan. This retrospective study was conducted in Taiwan between April 1, 2019 and August 30, 2022. Of 1901 screened patients, 174 thalassemia carriers were identified, indicating a carrier rate of 9.2 %. The prevalence of alpha-thalassemia, beta-thalassemia, and combined alpha- and beta-thalassemia was 7.8 %, 1.3 %, and 0.1 %, respectively. Specifically, 84.5 %, 13.8 %, and 1.1 % of the patients had alpha-thalassemia, beta-thalassemia, and both types of thalassemia, respectively. These carrier rates were higher than those reported in previous studies. Among alpha-thalassemia carriers, the SEA (Southeast Asian) type was the most prevalent at 52.7 %, followed by the right-end deletion type (-α3.7) at 30.4 %. Using the MCV cut-off method would have missed 33.8 % and 12.5 % of alpha- and beta-thalassemia carriers, respectively. Screening for thalassemia carriers based solely on MCV leads to a high rate of misdiagnosis. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply NGS to analyze the distribution of thalassemia in Taiwan, offering a valuable foundation for screening, prevention, and treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) provides a curative option for patients with hemoglobinopathies by establishing donor-derived hematopoiesis. However, outcomes can be compromised by toxicities and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), particularly in patients older than 13 years. To evaluate the safety and benefit of extended duration (until day +365) abatacept incorporated into GVHD prophylaxis compared to the inclusion of prednisone in children and adolescents with hemoglobinopathy undergoing HCT from related and unrelated donors. Forty patients with hemoglobinopathy received reduced intensity conditioning and prednisone-inclusive GVHD prophylaxis. Outcomes were compared with 20 subsequent patients who received extended duration abatacept instead of prednisone. The incidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome was 17% with prednisone and 0% with abatacept. Acute grade 3-4 GVHD occurred in 28% of patients who received prednisone and in 0% that received abatacept (p=0.011). Among patients who received prednisone, chronic GVHD was observed in 2.5% (mild), 5% (moderate), and 30% (severe) of cases. In contrast, abatacept recipients experienced chronic GVHD at rates of 25% (mild), 5% (moderate), and 5% (severe). Oral involvement was most common in patients with chronic GVHD who received abatacept. Post-transplant immune reconstitution patterns were similar in both groups. Infection in the presence of GVHD and systemic immune suppression was the primary cause of mortality in patients who received prednisone. Two patients in the abatacept group developed EBV-associated lymphadenopathy that responded to rituximab. The only death following abatacept-inclusive prophylaxis was in a patient that died after primary graft rejection and a subsequent transplant. Overall survival and event-free survival were 87% and 80% (OS) with prednisone. The corresponding numbers were 95% and 90%, respectively, with abatacept despite a higher proportion of recipients at risk for poor outcomes (older age, mismatched grafts) in the abatacept group. Including extended duration abatacept to GVHD prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of GVHD and allows expansion of donor and transplant options in children and adolescents with hemoglobinopathy, with unrelated donor HCT outcomes matching those after matched sibling donor HCT."

    "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence, hematological characteristics and optimal cutoff values for mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) in carriers with combined α- and β-thalassemia (αβ-thalassemia) in the Huizhou region of southern China. The epidemiological investigation, including prevalence assessment and genotype distribution analysis of αβ-thalassemia, was conducted in a cohort of 14,146 participants (Prevalence cohort). Furthermore, a comprehensive comparative analysis of hematological parameters was performed among 13,888 individuals grouped by genotype (Phenotype cohort). We found a prevalence rate of 0.86% for αβ-thalassemia in the Huizhou region, with 72 genotypes identified, and the predominant genotype was --<sup>SEA</sup>/αα, β<sup>CD41-42</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (19.16%). Significant differences in MCV and MCH were found between all genotype groups. Compared to pure β-thalassemia carriers, individuals co-inherited with α<sup>+</sup>/αα and α<sup>0</sup>/αα exhibited improved hematological profiles, while individuals co-inherited with α<sup>+</sup>/α<sup>0</sup> displayed more severe phenotype. ROC analysis demonstrated superior diagnostic performance of MCV/MCH in β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> versus β<sup>+</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> carriers. MCV ≤ 56 fL and/or MCH ≤ 17.4 pg strongly indicated α<sup>+</sup>/α<sup>0</sup>, β<sup>+</sup>/β<sup>N</sup>, while MCV ≤ 56.70 fL and/or MCH ≤ 18.30 pg demonstrated robust diagnostic performance for α<sup>+</sup>/α<sup>0</sup>, β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> carriers, and MCV > 66.47 fL and/or MCH > 21.59 pg were strongly suggestive of the presence of α<sup>0</sup>/αα, β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>N</sup>. Moreover, we found 371 (18.41%) of 2,015 αβ-thalassemia carriers had the same type of thalassemia as their spouses. This study suggests that particular attention should be paid to αβ-thalassemia during premarital and pre-pregnancy examinations. Our findings provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, disease control and screening of αβ-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Background & objectives Haemoglobinopathies, particularly thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are of major public health concern and pose a significant health burden in India particularly in the State of Odisha. The molecular complexity of β-thalassemia involves over 350 mutations, resulting in reduced beta-globin synthesis, excess iron, and oxidative stress. Methods Chorionic villi samples from β-thalassemia carrier mothers collected through trans-abdominal chorionic villi sampling (TA-CVS) were screened by real-time polymerase chain reaction for the most commonly found β-globin gene mutations: IVS 1-1 (G>T), 619 bp deletion, IVS 1-5 (G>C), CD15 (G>A), FS41/42 (-TTCT), HbS, FS8/9 (+G), -90 (C>T), CD16 (-C), HbE, CD15 (-T), CD30 (G>C), and -28 (A>G) using TOCE™ (Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension) technology. Reduced glutathione (GSH), redox status (GSH/GSSG ratio), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were investigated in foetuses of defined β-globin gene mutations by colorimetry and ELISA, respectively, to explore the potential of GSH and ET-1 as oxidative stress biomarkers. Results Of the total cases included in this study 40 per cent showed occurrence of HbS mutations with significant differences in GSH, GSSG, and redox ratio among mutation groups (P<0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a non-significant association between GSH and ET-1 levels. Interpretation & conclusions This study provides key insights into oxidative stress in foetuses with defined β-globin gene mutations. GSH and ET-1 may be therapeutic targets to mitigate oxidative stress and healthy placentation in pregnancies with haemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Thalassaemia is a significant public health concern in Southeast Asia, yet little is known about health risk behaviours in adolescents with this condition. This study aimed to compare health risk behaviours between adolescents with thalassaemia and healthy controls, and to identify associated clinical and sociodemographic factors. This cross-sectional study included 60 adolescents with thalassaemia (aged 10-18 years) and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in Thailand. Health risk behaviours were assessed using the validated Thai Youth Risk Behaviour Survey. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with risk behaviours. Adolescents with thalassaemia reported higher rates of non-seatbelt use (25.0% vs. 1.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and mental health problems (13.3% vs. 0.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.027) compared to controls. However, they exhibited lower rates of inadequate exercise (70.0% vs. 86.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.045) and excessive screen time (66.7% vs. 96.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In the thalassaemia group, older age (aOR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.09-7.09), female gender (aOR = 39.73, 95% CI: 0.89-1770.49) and lower pre-transfusion haemoglobin levels (aOR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.64) were associated with increased odds of mental health problems. Higher pre-transfusion haemoglobin levels were associated with lower odds of violent behaviour (aOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.92). Adolescents with thalassaemia exhibit distinct patterns of health risk behaviours, influenced by age, gender and disease severity. These findings underscore the need for integrated physical and psychosocial care, highlighting the importance of tailored health education and interventions for this vulnerable group."

A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase using a combination of specific key words. The records found were screened in two phases (title/abstract, and full-text screening). All the original observational cross-sectional studies conducted on beta-thalassemia major cases and controls reporting the RNFLT and CT were included. The Meta-analysis was run for comparing the OCT measurements between beta-thalassemia cases and controls including pooled effect size, confidence intervals (CI), quality assessment, and publication bias. The measurements included were RNFLT (average, and in various quadrants), and CT. A total of 10 studies were included in this Meta-analysis including a total of 684 individuals, 362 cases and 322 controls. The RNFLT and CT showed a significant reduction in the values of beta-thalassemia cases as compared to controls. The heterogeneity among the included studies was found to be 92.65% for the average RNFLT and 30.13% for the CT making it obvious to use random effects model for analyzing the RNFLT values while fixed effects model for the CT. The Egger's test showed significant publication bias among all the parameters except for nasal RNFLT (<i>P</i>=0.507), and CT (<i>P</i>=0.281). The estimated average effect size for the average RNFLT was 1.04 (95%CI: 0.35 to 1.72, <i>Z</i>=2.961, <i>P</i>=0.003) and for CT was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.51 to 0.96, <i>Z</i>=6.523, <i>P</i><0.001). This Meta-analysis concludes that the RNFLT and CT are significantly thinner in beta-thalassemia cases in comparison to healthy individuals. Therefore, the RNFLT and CT must be evaluated in routine clinical practice in order to avoid irreversible vision loss particularly in beta-thalassemia individuals."

    "abstract": "Kv1.3 channels are associated with autoimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases. Scorpion venom is an excellent source of inhibitors for Kv1.3. Kv1.3, a pivotal voltage-gated potassium channel, has emerged as a critical therapeutic target for combating autoimmune and neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Some studies have tried to discover highly selective toxins targeting Kv1.3 channels, but it is still challenging. Here, we present a groundbreaking discovery of a potent peptide potassium channel blocker, Meuk7-3, derived from the venom of the scorpion, Mesobuthus crucittii. While similar to other Kv1.3 blockers, Meuk7-3's Lys19 residue may enhance its affinity for the channel. So, we redesigned the Meuk7-3 and generated three analogous, Meuk7-3 A, Meuk7-3B, and Meuk7-3C, to improve its drug-like properties and affinity to Kv1.3. Interaction evaluation with Kv1.3 revealed that Meuk7-3 and all its designed analogous could of Kv1.3's pore through the interaction of Lys19 of the peptide with Tyr447, Tyr797, Tyr1147, and Tyr1497, critical residues located at the channel pore of Kv1.3.However, the stability of the interaction of designed peptides with Kv1.3 was more than Meuk7-3. Binding affinity analysis revealed that all designed peptides had a better binding affinity to Kv1.3 than Meuk7-3. Among the three analogous, Meuk7-3 A was found to have better drug-like properties and interaction situations, including binding energy and affinity to Kv1.3, compared to Meuk-3 native. These findings provide new data for designing highly effective Kv1.3 inhibitors by computational tools for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, although experimental testing is necessary to validate them."

PK allosteric activators have been shown to increase ATP and reduce 2,3-disphosphoglycerate among red blood cells leading to improved oxygen affinity, sickling, and hemolysis. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PK activators in hemolytic anemias. This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was conducted using relevant keywords over PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrial.gov, till 29 September 2024. Relevant data was extracted into a spreadsheet and synthesized qualitatively. The literature search yielded 7,153 results, with 7 studies ultimately included in the review. These studies involved 206 patients, 166 of whom received mitapivat and the rest received placebo. Hemoglobin response was achieved by 38.0% to 80.0% of participants receiving mitapivat, with an average increase of 0.4 to 1.7 g/dL. Most studies reported improvements in bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte levels. Adverse events (AEs) were experienced by 93.2% of participants, with rates of 93.97% and 89.7% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, most AEs were mild and transient, and 23.4% were graded as 3 or higher. In this study, PK activators, particularly mitapivat, demonstrated promising efficacy and safety profiles in managing hemolytic anemias. These agents significantly improved hemoglobin levels, markers of hemolysis, and hematopoietic response, offering a beneficial therapeutic option for various hemolytic conditions, including pyruvate kinase deficiency, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. A protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) before study initiation, CRD42024598980."

    "abstract": "Chronic anemia patients (such as thalassemia) often rely on long-term red blood cell transfusion to sustain life. However, alloimmune reactions against blood group antigens can pose serious risks to the patients' clinical treatment and survival. The regulatory mechanisms of transfusion-related alloimmunity are not yet well understood. For example, some patients, despite long-term transfusions, do not develop alloimmune reactions, while others produce alloantibodies against multiple blood group antigens, making transfusion therapy increasingly difficult. Red blood cell blood group alloimmunity involves various immune cells, including antigen-presenting cells and different T cells. Many studies are exploring the regulatory roles and even potential interventions. This article reviews the correlation between cellular immunity and red blood cell blood group antigens in alloimmune responses, and explores the interaction between the two, as well as their impact on immune responses."

Peripheral smear showed sickle cells; high-performance liquid chromatography indicated sickle beta thalassemia (HbS 76%, HbA2 5.3%, HbA 7.7%). Genetic analysis confirmed compound heterozygosity: HBB: c.20A>T (codon 6 A>T, sickle cell mutation) and HBB: c.92+5G>C (IVS 1-5 G>C, beta thalassemia mutation). She was managed with exchange transfusions and initiated on hydroxyurea. Family screening revealed her father was a sickle trait carrier, her mother a beta-thalassemia carrier, and her asymptomatic brother had the same compound heterozygosity. Arterial stroke can be an atypical and rare presentation of sickle beta thalassemia, highlighting the quiet progression of hemoglobinopathies and the necessity for heightened clinical suspicion.

This study systematically evaluates alterations in both intra-brain network functional connectivity (FC) and inter-network functional connectivity (FNC) in β-TM patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and independent component analysis (ICA), aiming to uncover the potential mechanisms underlying their neurofunctional impairments. This study included 72 β-TM patients and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). rs-fMRI was used to collect brain functional data, and ICA was applied to extract 14 resting-state functional networks (RSNs). Differences in FC within networks and FNC between the two groups were further compared to investigate the brain network abnormalities in β-TM patients. In β-TM patients, FC within brain networks was significantly reduced in the anterior default mode network (aDMN), posterior default mode network (pDMN), left frontoparietal network (lFPN), right frontoparietal network (rFPN), ventral attention network (VAN), and executive control network (ECN). In contrast, FC was significantly increased in the dorsal sensorimotor network (dSMN) and posterior visual network (pVN). FNC analysis revealed that β-TM patients exhibited enhanced connectivity between the lFPN and rFPN, as well as between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and VAN. However, connectivity was significantly weakened between the DAN and lFPN, ECN, auditory network (AN), and salience network (SN); as well as between the pVN and dSMN. These findings suggest impairments in cognitive control, attention allocation, and sensory integration, with specific disruptions in the SN that may contribute to the observed dysfunctions. Brain network abnormalities in β-TM patients manifest as an alternating pattern of enhanced and weakened connectivity, revealing the profound impact of chronic anemia and hypoxia on cognitive, emotional, and sensory functions."

This inherited blood disorder, categorized into beta-thalassemia and alpha-thalassemia, results in insufficient globin production, leading to anemia and iron overload from frequent transfusions. Severe cases, known as thalassemia major, require regular blood transfusions. Beyond clinical suspicion and biochemical tests, molecular techniques are essential for confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment. Advanced molecular profiling methods such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), Third-Generation Sequencing (TGS), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are effective in detecting mutations. Epigenetic factors also play a crucial role, driving the development of epidrugs for targeted therapy. This review covers various molecular techniques, established gene-editing methods, epigenetic mechanisms, and the impact of artificial intelligence on thalassemia management.

This was a retrospective study in which all samples with Hb F > 5% and/or Hb A<sub>2</sub> > 3.5% suspected of β-thalassemia/hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) were enrolled in the study from 2016 to 2024. Routine genetic analysis was detected 24 common α- and β-thalassemia variants. For unresolved cases, Sanger sequencing was applied to identify novel variants in HBB and HBG genes. Additionally, Gap-PCR with specific primers and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were utilized to screen for potential deletions. Finally, third-generation sequencing (TGS) was implemented to confirm duplicated genomic segments. A cohort of 65 individuals was analyzed, revealing heterozygous β-thalassemia/HPFH/δβ-thalassemia in 83.1% (54/65) of cases.

The onset of symptoms in his first admission were presented with right foot weakness and difficulty walking. The electromyogram findings revealed multiple peripheral nerve damage of bilateral lower limbs, mainly demyelination. Combined with the cerebrospinal fluid tests and medical history, the patient was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory demyelinating multiple radiculopathy (CIDP). After neurological rehabilitation physiotherapy, vitamin B12 supplements and hormonotherapy, the patient's symptoms improved and he was discharged. Ten days after discharge, he was readmitted with dizziness, lethargy, memory and cognitive decline. Imaging findings included MRI, Arterial spin labeling (ASL) and magnetic resonance spectral (MRS) confirmed that the patient had suffered from a cerebral infarction, the results of follow-up magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging were consistent with the typical imaging findings of cerebral vasculitis. No EBV infection was detected during his two admissions, which was extremely rare in XLP1 cases. Due to the patient's guardians declining the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), we were limited to symptomatic and supportive treatments, focusing on improving brain metabolism, and with a transitory stable condition at present. This case expands our understanding of rare XLP1 complications, shows a potential to study on the immune-related mechanism of possibly lymphocytic abnormal proliferation disorder associated with XLP1 involving both peripheral nerves and cerebrovascular, underscores that XLP1 patients should have regular examinations on their central and peripheral nervous system in order to detect early lesions and prevent serious consequences.

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is a recognized complication of β-thalassemia major (β-TM), impacting cardiac function. Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) offers a sensitive assessment of myocardial deformation, particularly global longitudinal strain (GLS). This study aimed to assess the association between vitamin D levels and LV function in β-TM children and to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on cardiac parameters. Seventy-five β-TM children underwent vitamin D level assessment, conventional echocardiography, and STE. Patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency (25-OHD3 < 30 ng/ml) received vitamin D supplementation (4000-5000 IU/day). Follow-up assessments were conducted after vitamin D normalization. Vitamin D insufficiency (81.3%) and deficiency (18.7%) were prevalent. Vitamin D levels were inversely correlated with age and disease duration (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with transfusion/chelation therapy onset. Conventional echocardiography showed an inverse correlation between vitamin D level and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (p < 0.001) and deceleration time (p = 0.003). STE revealed a positive correlation between vitamin D and GLS (p < 0.001). Vitamin D supplementation significantly increased median vitamin D levels (from 16.0 to 39.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and improved STE parameters, including AP4L, AP3L, AP2L, and GLS (p < 0.001), indicating enhanced myocardial function. Vitamin D deficiency in β-TM children was correlated with impaired cardiac function. Vitamin D supplementation significantly improved cardiac function. Regular monitoring and maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels are crucial for preventing adverse cardiac effects. • β-Thalassemia major is frequently complicated by cardiac dysfunction, a major contributor to mortality. • Cardiac iron overload is a primary driver of cardiac dysfunction in β-TM. • Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired cardiac function, beyond iron overload, in β-TM children. • Vitamin D supplementation could improve cardiac function in β-thalassemia major patients."

Here, we report an enzymatic biofuel cell self-powered biosensor (EBFC-SPB) integrating DNAzyme Walker and dumbbell hybridization chain reaction (DHCR) cascade amplification for attomolar-level detection of TATA-28, a critical thalassemia biomarker. The biosensor employs Au@Zr-MOF/graphdiyne (GDY) as a conductive substrate to immobilize glucose oxidase (bioanode) and [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>-responsive DNA circuits (biocathode). Target-activated DNAzyme Walker liberates single-stranded DNA (S0), initiating dumbbell HCR to generate electronegative DNA nanostructures that adsorb [Ru(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3+</sup>. This process drives efficient electron transfer from the bioanode to the biocathode, greatly amplifying the open-circuit voltage (E<sup>OCV</sup>) compared to non-target conditions. The dual-amplification strategy achieves a linear response from 0.1 fM to 10 nM TATA-28 with a 35.3 aM detection limit (S/N = 3), surpassing existing methods in sensitivity. Successful validation in human serum (recovery: 90.1-106.5 %) highlights its clinical potential for early thalassemia screening."

    "abstract": "To compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) commercial 3D quantitative Dixon sequence (qDixon) and 2D multi-gradient recalled echo sequence (GRE) for iron quantification in multiple abdominal organs. 1.5T MRI GRE and qDixon data were collected on patients with 211 MR exams from 171 patients (86 males, 85 females; median age: 21 years). Compare the R2* values of liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys using Bland-Altman, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), concordance correlation coefficients (CCC), and linear regression. Iron overload (IO) diagnostic concordance was assessed using overall agreement and the Kappa coefficient. Bland-Altman analysis of liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidney R2* values between GRE and qDixon, resulted in a bias (absolute mean difference) of -11.3 1/s (LoA: 77.7 and -100.3), -11.2 1/s (LoA: 123.9 and -146.3), 5.1 1/s (LoA: 117.3 and -107.1), and 1.9 1/s (LoA: 14.7 and -10.9). The CCCs between GRE and qDixon R2* values for liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys were 0.98, 0.94, 0.96, and 0.95, the ICCs were 0.99, 0.95, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Linear regression analysis correlating abdominal organs R2* values of GRE and qDixon resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.96, 0.89, 0.93, and 0.92 (all P < 0.001). The overall agreement was 98.5 %, 94.8 %, 92.6 %, and 90.7 %; the Kappa value was 0.95, 0.89, 0.84, and 0.69 (all P < 0.001). The qDixon and GRE showed good agreement and significant positive in measuring R2* values for IO assessment in abdominal organs, with qDixon being an excellent adjunctive diagnostic method."

    "abstract": "Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare, chronic cerebrovascular disorder involving progressive bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery and its branches, forming abnormal collateral networks that appear as a \"puff of smoke\" on angiography. <b>While the term MMD is used when the condition is idiopathic, it is called moyamoya syndrome (MMS) when associated with underlying systemic conditions</b>. Reports of MMS with β-thalassemia major are rare, with fewer than 6 cases documented; herein, we report a case of a 6-year-old female, a known case of β-thalassemia major, who exhibited left-sided hemiparesis, revealing radiological and clinical features consistent with MMS. MRI, CTA, EEG, and Echocardiography were used as diagnostic workups to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was treated with hyper-transfusion therapy and pharmacological management, with an ongoing consideration of surgical intervention. The rarity of the occurrence of moyamoya syndrome in β-thalassemia major patients has been discussed, with emphasis on the importance of early recognition and intervention to mitigate neurological complications. This case contributes to the limited literature on β-thalassemia major and MMS occurring together, underscoring the need for heightened clinical awareness and timely management strategies."

    "abstract": "Deferasirox is a newer oral iron chelator which needs to be given for at least 1 year to see a significant decrease in serum ferritin level in thalassemia patients with chronic iron overload. This study aimed to assess the safety profile of branded generic deferasirox in pediatric thalassemia cases, as it has not been studied in eastern India, especially in real-world settings. It was an observational hospital-based study in a government tertiary care teaching hospital where branded generic deferasirox is distributed free of cost to patients. One hundred and seventy-four patients were included. Safety assessment was done through active questioning about the symptoms starting after deferasirox therapy and through laboratory parameters and clinical examination. Sixty percent of patients developed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with deferasirox during the 1-year follow-up. ADRs were more common in males than females. The highest number of ADRs was related to the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary system. The ADRs were either mild or moderate. Compliance and number of ADRs were found to be inversely correlated. ADRs of deferasirox are acceptable looking at the benefits. Regular monitoring and management of ADRs will facilitate patient compliance. However, healthcare professionals need to be alert while prescribing this drug and report any ADR, even if it is not labeled. This study found increased serum lipase and mouth ulcer as adverse effects, which are not yet labeled. These can be signals for further analysis by regulatory authorities."

    "title": "3D-QSAR based computational screening of potent ligands against L-type calcium channel (LTCC) protein structure for iron overload in β-thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Excessive body iron, also known as iron overload, occurs in thalassaemia patients who require blood transfusions. Iron overload causes iron accumulation in a variety of tissues, particularly in the liver, brain, heart, and endocrine tissues. Arrhythmias, dilated cardiomyopathy, and diastolic failure are caused by elevated cardiac iron levels. The removal of iron using an iron-chelating agent is the primary strategy for the treatment of iron overload. Deferasirox has been used in humans for half a century; however, it is less favoured by patients owing to intravenous administration and adverse effects. L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers have been shown to reduce excess iron in cardiomyocytes, liver cells, and nerve cells. The uptake of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) in rat ventricular myocytes has been demonstrated to be mediated by the LTCC. In iron-overloaded animal models, the LTCC blocker nifedipine suppressed iron overload-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis and increased urine iron excretion. LTCC inhibitors also play a role in the regulation of renal iron transport. This in silico study utilized the bioactivity value (IC<sub>50</sub> value) of known inhibitors for the 3D QSAR pharmacophore model was prepared. The selected model (Hypo1) was used to screen the library and was validated using a test set of compounds. The best-hit molecules were further investigated using virtual screening and molecular docking analysis. Top-ranked candidates were tested for toxicity, and their inhibitory activity and iron chelation efficacy were predicted. Finally, most chemical compounds were obtained with optimised docking scores, low estimated values, acceptable toxicity, and ADMET profiles. Through lead optimization, the Hit_1 compound was selected to design the novel inhibitor. The compound was screened using the pharmacophore derivative, and docking studies show an improved estimate of the novel compound's activity."

The performance of these models was compared using a set of evaluation metrics. An additional cohort of 2000 patients was recruited for external validation to assess the generalization of the models. The results demonstrated that the categorical boosting (CatBoost) model exhibited the best discriminative ability in both the training and external validation cohorts. The model was then integrated into an online platform, which holds the potential to act as an auxiliary tool for identifying and genotyping thalassemia via automatic analysis of routine blood test parameters."

    "abstract": "MCS-R regulatory elements are very important for the synthesis of α-globin. Deletion of the major α-globin regulatory elements compounded with deletion of α-globin genes can cause Hb Bart's (c4) hydrops fetalis, which is the severe form of α-thalassemia. In this report, a 19-year-old female at the 16th week of gestation came to our center due to abnormal fetal cardiothoracic ratio and thickened placental depth. The electrophoresis result of fetal umbilical cord blood revealed the level of Hb Bart's band to be 87.6%, which suggested the fetus was Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. Next generation sequencing screen using targeted capture was used to detect the genotype of the fetus to be -SEA deletion, βA/βA. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is very useful to detect copy number variation (deletions/duplications), the result of which suggested the existence of -SEA deletion compounded with the novel large deletion of the major α-globin regulatory element (MCS-R2, R1, R3 and R4). Using the self-designed MLPA probe, the deletion should extend from the telomere downstream and the downstream breakpoint was between 143702 and 144291(GRch38/hg18). The novel deletion was also observed in the fetus' father and grandfather who had mild anemia. Of cases with the MCS deletion compounded with α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia, this was the earliest time when the fetus presented fetal edema. Our study gave more evidence for genetic counseling for MCS deletion."

Although previous case series have demonstrated the benefit of blood transfusions in reducing serum triglycerides, information regarding clinical outcomes and standard management in this setting remains limited. To identify the clinical course, treatment strategies, and outcomes of patients with hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome. We performed a comprehensive search of the Scopus, PubMed, and Embase databases. We included only English-language articles and did not apply any publication date limits. The databases were last accessed on September 1, 2024. This study was registered under number CRD420250587918 and included studies involving children and adults with thalassemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and available data on clinical course. A total of 14 publications were included in the analysis, all of which were case reports or case series. No higher-quality evidence was available. Among 28 children with hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome, there were 22 cases of β-thalassemia major and 6 cases of hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia, including our illustrative case. The median age of onset was 11 months, and 92.3% of cases presented prior to the first blood transfusion. The common clinical manifestations included pallor (100%) and hepatosplenomegaly (67.9%). For hypertriglyceridemia-related symptoms, lipemia retinalis and xanthomas were observed in 25.0% and 10.7% of cases, respectively. The median hemoglobin level was 5.5 g/dL, while the median triglyceride level was 935 mg/dL. For management, 92.9% of cases received blood transfusions with or without other interventions. At a median of 12 months' follow-up, all patients responded to the treatment without lipid-lowering agents, and 85.7% of cases were alive. Hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome occurs exclusively in young children and usually presents with anemia and severe hypertriglyceridemia prior to the first transfusion. Management with blood transfusions provides a favorable response. However, long-term regular monitoring is warranted."

    "abstract": "In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the conditioning regimen plays a crucial role in the transplantation process, aiming to eliminate any leukemia cells and suppress the recipient's immune system to promote engraftment. Conditioning regimens are categorized into myeloablative (MAC), non-myeloablative (NMA), and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) based on their intensity. The choice of regimen depends on disease type, patient age, comorbidities, and donor source. The conditioning regimens vary between matched sibling donors and alternative donors. In haploidentical transplantation, the mainstream non-T cell depletion protocols included the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)/antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-based and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy)-based strategies. In hematologic non-malignancies such as aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, and thalassemia, the tailored conditioning regimens are crucial for improving outcomes. The diversified and personalized conditioning regimens are the future direction in the field of transplantation. Future directions may include integrating new targeted therapies and immunotherapies into conditioning regimens to further optimize outcomes."

    "title": "Thalassemia in Sub-Saharan Africa: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management - a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the reduced production of hemoglobin, leading to anemia and related complications. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of thalassemia, particularly beta-thalassemia, is significant due to genetic predisposition and historical factors such as malaria endemicity. Despite the increasing awareness of the disease, thalassemia continues to be a major public health challenge in the region. Early diagnosis, effective management, and prevention strategies are limited by factors such as poor health care infrastructure, a lack of skilled professionals, and insufficient access to necessary medical treatments. This review article explores the epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, and current management practices for thalassemia in Sub-Saharan Africa. The high prevalence of thalassemia carriers in the region, particularly in malaria-endemic areas, highlights the need for genetic counseling and prenatal screening programs. Furthermore, diagnostic techniques such as hemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA testing are often underutilized due to logistical and financial constraints, leading to late diagnoses and suboptimal care. Treatment options, including blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy, remain inadequate in many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa due to the limited availability of health care resources."

    "abstract": "Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common hereditary hemolytic anemia in which red blood cells (RBCs) assume spherocytic morphology, predisposing to easy destruction in the spleen. Diagnosis is readily made when spherocytes are demonstrated in the blood film of patients presenting with anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. A positive osmotic fragility test (OFT) is also supportive. However, when classical features are not seen in either blood film or OFT, diagnosis might become complicated, particularly in resource-limited settings. We report a teenager who was transitioned to the adult medical outpatient department with a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia; the etiology, however, was never identified. He has required monthly transfusions since six months of life and has developed antibodies to RBCs, secondary hemochromatosis, and gallstones. Workup for thalassemia and autoimmune causes was negative. A barrage of negative investigations ultimately led to a genetic analysis, which revealed a heterozygous mutation for the c.2671C>T (p.Arg891*) variant in the SPTA1 gene and a novel mutation for SPTA1 c.7134+5G>A (intronic). He was formally diagnosed with HS and underwent splenectomy. Post procedure, his anemia improved, and transfusion requirements steadily reduced. His sister exhibits the same heterozygous mutation for SPTA1 c.7134+5G>A (intronic), but did not have any clinical or laboratory manifestation of the disease. We postulate that this novel mutation in SPTA1 c.7134+5G>A (intronic) might play a role in determining disease severity, particularly when associated with a pathogenic variant."

Genotype analysis was conducted on 84 thalassemia patients requiring transfusion, and retrospective analysis of iron overload was performed on 48 transfusion-dependent patients. Among the 84 thalassemia cases requiring transfusion, six mutations of α-thalassemia were identified, including --<sup>SEA</sup>, α<sup>CS</sup>, -α<sup>3.7</sup>, -α<sup>4.2</sup>, α<sup>QS</sup>, and α<sup>WS</sup>. Nine mutations of β-thalassemia were also found, with CD41-42 being the most common. Of the 48 transfusion-dependent patients, 40 (83.3%) had iron overload with serum ferritin (SF) levels above 1,000 ng/mL. The recent SF level was lower than 3 years ago, but the overall ferritin level remains elevated. β-thalassemia was the predominant type among transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients, with CD41-42/-28, CD41-42/IVS-II-654, and CD17/IVS-II-654 being the most common genotypes. Proper blood transfusion and iron chelation therapy are essential for managing transfusion-dependent thalassemia. While some patients show a reduction in SF levels after 3 years of treatment, there are still individuals who exhibit elevated levels necessitating ongoing management."

This analysis uncovered two unknow point mutations: <i>HBG1</i>: c.-305 A > G and <i>HBG2</i>: c.-309 A > G. Notably, the mutation in the <sup>A</sup>γ-globin promoter lies within the AGGAA binding site of the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor IZKF1.

    "abstract": "Alpha-thalassemia is a common inherited hemoglobin disorder caused by deletions or point mutations in the HBA1 and/or HBA2 genes, leading to reduced or absent synthesis of alpha-globin chains. Although deletional mutations are predominant, non-deletional mutations can also contribute to the clinical spectrum of the disease, with varying severity. This study aimed to characterize two novel mutations in the HBA1 gene, a 230 bp microdeletion and a missense mutation (NP_000549.1:p.Ala29Pro), identified in two unrelated Tunisian families. Additionally, we assessed the clinical, hematological, molecular, and in silico structural impact of these mutations. Peripheral blood samples were collected from affected individuals and family members. Hematological parameters were measured using automated cell counters, and hemoglobin fractions were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Genomic DNA was extracted, and common α-thalassemia deletions were screened via gap-PCR. Negative cases underwent sequencing of HBA1 and HBA2 exons. The novel deletion was confirmed by gap-PCR, gel purification, and sequencing. The pathogenicity of the missense mutation was assessed using in silico tools (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutationTaster), and structural modeling was performed using Swiss-PdbViewer and DynaMut to evaluate protein stability and flexibility. In Family A, a 4-year-old proband exhibited mild anemia, microcytosis, hypochromia, and low ferritin levels unresponsive to iron supplementation. A novel heterozygous 230 bp deletion (NC_000016.10:g.176695_176925del), named Hemoglobin Ariana, was identified in the HBA1 gene, affecting the 5'UTR, exon 1, and part of intron 1. In Family B, a 4-month-old proband presented with co-inheritance of α-thalassemia and Hemoglobin C. Sequencing revealed a novel missense mutation (NM_000558.5:c.85G > C, NP_000549.1:p.Ala29Pro), designated Hemoglobin Tozeur. In silico analysis predicted the mutation as deleterious, with structural modeling indicating destabilization of the α-globin protein, reduced stability, and altered flexibility near the heme-binding region. This study identifies two novel HBA1 mutations associated with α-thalassemia in Tunisia. The combined clinical, molecular, and structural analyses highlight the importance of comprehensive genetic screening and in silico modeling for accurate diagnosis and improved management of thalassemia cases."

However, the safety and efficacy of a subsequent autologous HSC-based GT after graft failure with a previous allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) remains unclear. Some individuals who have experienced a failed first attempt at a potentially curative therapy might seek a second opportunity for cure via GT. In this article, we discuss various factors related to patient and HSC health that may influence feasibility, and shared decision making regarding whether an individual who has previously received an allogeneic HCT and experienced graft failure could consider an autologous GT. Exposure to chronic inflammatory stress and conditioning chemotherapy may compromise HSC fitness, reduce hematopoietic reserve, accelerate HSC aging, and promote the accumulation of deleterious genetic mutations, all of which may adversely affect the safety and efficacy of the GT."

Zinc and magnesium are essential micronutrients involved in many cellular processes. Several studies have found that their deficiencies are common in SCD patients and may further complicate the disease. This study was conducted to examine plasma levels of zinc and magnesium in a group of SCD patients in Latakia. Methods A total of 85 SCD patients (52 males and 33 females) with both sickle cell anemia (HbSS) and hemoglobin sickle-beta-thalassemia (Hb S/β-Thal) genotypes at the steady state, and 30 healthy controls, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with no age limits. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were measured using colorimetric methods. Results Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls (P < 0.05). Twelve SCD patients (14.1%) were zinc-deficient, and 37 (43%) had magnesium deficiency. Plasma zinc and magnesium levels were higher in HbSS patients than those with Hb S/β-Thal patients, but with no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Notably, all zinc-deficient SCD patients were < 16 years old. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in zinc deficiency distribution between males and females. Age and gender had no significant statistical relations with magnesium deficiency in SCD patients (P > 0.05). Conclusion This study has shown that plasma zinc and magnesium levels were significantly lower in SCD patients compared to the controls, with no significant difference between HbSS and Hb S/β-Thal genotypes. Zinc and magnesium administration may be required in SCD patients from an early age, especially zinc, to mitigate the adverse effects of their deficiencies."

However, their exact mechanisms, especiallay on the evasion strategies of tumor cells from the host immune system are not fully understood. The current study investigates the effects of two SMIs, ibrutinib and venetoclax, on the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Leukemic cells were isolated from 20 patients with ALL by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) technique. Isolated leukemic cells were cultured and treated by ibrutinib and venetoclax for 48 h. Cell viability and apoptosis were monitored through MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The mRNA expression levels of checkpoint molecules PD-L1, galectin-9, CD200, CD155, CD47, and anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β were determined by Real-Time PCR method. The purity of MACS-isolated ALL leukemic cells was >98% as determined by flow cytometry. Following treatment, the proliferation of leukemic cells was significantly decreased and the apoptosis rate was significantly increased, which was more remarkable for venetoclax. Moreover, treatment of leukemic cells with ibrutinib and venetoclax showed alterations in the mRNA expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory ligands and TGF-β. Our results indicated that small molecule inhibitors not only hinder proliferation and enhance apoptosis, but also affect the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint ligands. By elucidating the precise underlying mechanisms, these drugs could emerge as promising therapeutic options, particularly in the context of combination therapy for ALL."

We assessed seven neurocognitive domains: attention, working memory, processing speed, non-verbal IQ, verbal learning, visual memory and fine motor dexterity. Additionally, we analysed relationships between neurocognitive performance, SCIs, haemodynamics and oxygen metabolism parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>). Our findings reveal that only processing speed was affected in SCD patients relative to norms, thalassaemia patients and controls. Fine motor dexterity was lower across all groups, possibly due to normative data not reflecting the transition from handwriting to typing. Notably, we found no correlation between neurocognitive performance, SCIs and perfusion and oxygenation parameters, suggesting that reduced processing speed may stem from other SCD-related factors, highlighting the need for further research."

    "title": "Lifetime Risk of Liver Disease in Patients With β-Thalassemia: Data From the de-LIGHT Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Liver disease is common in patients with β-thalassemia, but data on lifetime incidence and risk factors are limited. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 557 patients with β-thalassemia followed from diagnosis for a median of 38 years. Predictive, survival, and regression analyses were used to determine the association between liver disease and potential risk factors. The crude incidence of liver disease was 26.4% (fibrosis/cirrhosis 24.2%, median age 34.4 years; hepatocellular carcinoma 2.3%, median age 45.4 years, 38.5% not preceded by cirrhosis). Among evaluated risk factors, only hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.195, p < 0.001) and lifetime serum ferritin level (adjusted HR per 100-ng/mL increase: 1.030, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with liver disease, with a lifetime serum ferritin level > 1500 ng/mL being the best predictor (p = 0.001). Liver disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients who had both versus either or neither risk factor (p < 0.001). Mostly severe and persistent but not mild-moderate or temporary/fluctuating elevation in liver enzymes was associated with liver disease development. Patients with β-thalassemia have a considerably increased lifetime risk of liver disease that is primarily driven by HCV infection and/or uncontrolled iron overload, especially in the 4th-5th decades of life."

    "abstract": "Abortion is an issue of critical importance at the intersection of medical science and ethics, as maternal and fetal causes can motivate this practice. A correct understanding of these underlying factors can assist in its prevention through timely diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to investigate the etiological factors and outcomes of legal, therapeutic abortions. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted, in which 131 pregnant patients who underwent abortion after obtaining permission from the Forensic Medicine Organization, were referred to a hospital in northern Iran from 2018 to 2022. The relevant patient information was collected and recorded in checklists for analysis. The average age of the referred patients was 30 ± 7 years, with a mean BMI of 27 ± 6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and an average gestational age of 14 ± 3 weeks. Therapeutic abortion was attributed to 43 cases involving maternal factors, with cardiovascular complications being the most prevalent cause. Furthermore, 97 cases were associated with fetal factors, among which the most common causes were chromosomal abnormalities, nervous system disorders, and thalassemia major; accounting for 24 cases (18 %), 23 cases (17 %), and 13 cases (9 %), respectively. In 70 % of cases, the treatment was simultaneous administration of misoprostol and curettage. The findings of the study highlight the importance of education and public awareness about the legal, ethical, and medical consequences of terminating a pregnancy, particularly among pregnant mothers who undergo therapeutic abortion with permission from the Forensic Medicine Organization. This may be an effective way to reduce the rate of abortion and its associated complications."

    "abstract": "To increase the diagnostic rate of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in the adult dialysis setting, a prediction model based on five readily available clinical parameters was recently developed and validated in an adult hemodialysis population. To further test the prediction model in clinical practice, this case series describes the retrospective application of the diagnostic algorithm in a group of adult dialysis patients with PH1 treated at different Italian nephrology centers. Between January and May 2023, adult patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing chronic hemodialysis with a genetic diagnosis of PH1, followed at 14 Italian nephrology centers, were selected for the retrospective application of the prediction model. The presence of at least one red flag of the diagnostic algorithm was reported in most patients (14 out of 15; 93%), two red flags were present in four patients (27%), and three red flags in two patients (13%). A history of active nephrolithiasis was the most common clinical feature (87% of patients), followed by early dialysis initiation, nephrocalcinosis and a family history of CKD (20-27%). Our study provides further evidence on the real-world application of a simple algorithm, implemented by easily accessible clinical parameters, to be used as a screening tool for diagnosing PH1 in adult patients undergoing dialysis. The successful implementation of this prediction model has the potential to facilitate timely diagnosis, improve patient outcomes, and inform targeted therapeutic interventions in this patient setting."

While genetic variations in proteins like S, C, and antithrombin are known to play a role in VTE, some cases remain unexplained. This study aims to investigate other genetic variations, including Protein Z (rs3024731), FV (rs1800595), and FGA (rs6050), to understand their potential association with VTE risk. The study included 118 VTE patients and 118 healthy individuals with no history of thromboembolic disorders. Blood samples were collected from the patients for DNA extraction, and genotyping was carried out using the amplification refractory mutation system-PCR (ARMS-PCR) technique. The results were validated through DNA sequencing. Data analysis was done using SPSS 27 software. Analysis has revealed significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs1800595 polymorphism between the control and case groups. It was found that individuals with the AG genotype had a 2.22 times higher likelihood of experiencing thrombophilia events [odds ratio (OR) = 2.229, P = 0.039, confidence interval (CI) = 95%], while the G allele increased the risk by 2.103 times (OR = 2.103, P = 0.047, CI = 95%). No significant correlation was observed between VTE and the rs3024731 and rs6050 polymorphisms. The rs1800595 polymorphism in the FV gene may be associated with an increased risk of thrombophilia in VTE patients."

    "title": "The role of iron in normal and impaired testicular function.",
    "abstract": "Iron plays a critical role in testicular physiology, impacting spermatogenesis, testosterone production, and overall testicular function. Iron homeostasis is maintained through systemic and cellular regulatory mechanisms, including hepcidin-mediated systemic iron control and the iron-responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) system at the cellular level. Germ cells require iron for cell divisions and development, while Leydig and Sertoli cells depend on iron for the biosynthesis of testosterone and the maintenance of sperm development, with iron-dependent enzymes playing essential roles in lipid metabolism, DNA synthesis, and mitochondrial function. Iron imbalances, including iron overload and deficiency, significantly impact testicular health. Excess iron accumulation induces oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis, contributing to testicular dysfunction. Hereditary hemochromatosis and beta-thalassemia major are associated with disrupted iron metabolism, leading to altered hormonal profiles and impaired spermatogenesis. Conversely, iron deficiency, often linked to dietary insufficiency or inflammatory conditions, can impair testosterone production and sperm quality. Bacterial and viral infections of the testis, such as those caused by Escherichia coli, Zika virus, and HIV, also alter iron metabolism, influencing immune responses and exacerbating testicular inflammation. Additionally, chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes may disrupt iron regulation and contribute to reproductive dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests a strong link between ferroptosis and testicular damage, with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation playing a key role in cell death pathways. This review highlights the complexity of iron regulation in the testis, the negative effects of disruptions of iron metabolism on male fertility and reproductive health as well as the gaps in knowledge that currently prevent therapeutic approaches to mitigate infertility associated with iron dysregulation."

Multiple blood transfusion burdens in thalassemia, particularly in lowincome countries, impact health-related quality of life. Objective Liver function parameters and health-related quality of life were assessed using Nepali version 36 short-form survey instruments to reveal the vitality, physical, mental, emotional, pain, general health, and social functioning of β-thalassemia cases. Method In this cross-sectional study, forty β-thalassemia cases who had visited the Universal College of Medical Sciences tertiary care teaching hospital of Lumbini Province, Nepal were enrolled. The hemoglobin variant band percentage was estimated by D-10 BioRad high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Mentzer Index (Mean Cell Volume by Red Blood Cell count) by Beckman hematological analyzer, and serum liver parameters (Bilirubin, Total protein, Albumin, Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, Alkaline phosphatase) were estimated by using Diatron fully automated analyzer. The internal consistency of the Nepali version of 36 shortform survey instruments was checked by Cronbach`s alpha was found to be > 0.70 from the recoded value. Data are analyzed using the STATA/MP14, and ANOVA and t-test are applied to test the significance considering p-value < 0.05. Result The frequency of the β-thalassemia Trait (60%) was higher than β-thalassemia Major (30%) and 7.5% β-thalassemia Intermedia co-morbidities with Sickle cell (2.5%) and β/δ variants (2.5%). Higher frequency was found in ethnic groups Muslim (32.5%) followed by Terai indigenous-Tharu (30%) and Madheshi (27.5%). The transfusiondependent cases have significantly higher Total, Direct, Indirect Bilirubin, and Alkaline phosphatase levels than non-transfusion dependent cases (p < 0.001). The physical functioning, general health, emotional health, and vitality were significantly decreased in β-thalassemia Major as compared to β-thalassemia Trait (p < 0.001), and significantly correlated with Mentzer index and HPLC patterns (HBA2/HBF) (p < 0.05). Conclusion Transfusion dependent β-thalassemia Major and Intermedia had elevated Bilirubin and Alkaline phosphatase levels as compared to non-transfusion dependent β-thalassemia Trait, exacerbating health-related quality of life, emphasizing the preventable disparities for optimized transfusion protocols and psychosocial support."

    "abstract": "This study develops a deep-learning method for automatic segmentation of the interventricular septum (IS) in MR images to measure myocardial T2* and estimate cardiac iron deposition in patients with thalassemia. This retrospective study used multiple-gradient-echo cardiac MR scans from 419 thalassemia patients to develop and evaluate the segmentation network. The network was trained on 1.5 T images from Center 1 and evaluated on 3.0 T unseen images from Center 1, all data from Center 2, and the CHMMOTv1 dataset. Model performance was assessed using five metrics, and T2* values were obtained by fitting the network output. Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CoV), and regression analysis were used to evaluate the consistency between automatic and manual methods. MA-BBIsegNet achieved a Dice of 0.90 on the internal test set, 0.85 on the external test set, and 0.81 on the CHMMOTv1 dataset. Bland-Altman analysis showed mean differences of 0.08 (95% LoA: -2.79 ∼ 2.63) ms (internal), 0.29 (95% LoA: -4.12 ∼ 3.54) ms (external) and 0.19 (95% LoA: -3.50 ∼ 3.88) ms (CHMMOTv1), with CoV of 8.9%, 6.8%, and 9.3%. Regression analysis yielded r values of 0.98 for the internal and CHMMOTv1 datasets, and 0.99 for the external dataset (p < 0.05). The IS segmentation network based on multiple-gradient-echo bright-blood images yielded T2* values that were in strong agreement with manual measurements, highlighting its potential for the efficient, non-invasive monitoring of myocardial iron deposition in patients with thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Glioma stands as one of the most lethal brain tumors in humans, and its accurate diagnosis is critical for patient treatment and prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely utilized for glioma diagnosis and research due to its non-invasive nature and clinical accessibility. According to the 2021 World Health Organization Central Nervous System Tumor Classification guidelines, glioma subtypes can be determined through molecular status information of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH), Chromosome 1p/19q codeletion (1p/19q), and Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-linked (ATRX) genes. In this study, we propose a dual-path parallel fusion network (MDPNet) designed to comprehensively extract heterogeneous features across different MRI modalities while simultaneously predicting the molecular status of IDH, 1p/19q, and ATRX. To mitigate the impact of data imbalance, we developed a cross-gene feature-sharing classifier and implemented an adaptive weighted loss function, substantially enhancing the model's predictive performance. In this study, each gene classification task was formulated as a binary classification problem. Experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. The achieved classification accuracies for IDH, ATRX, and 1p/19q reach 86.7%, 92.0%, and 89.3%, respectively. The source code of this study can be viewed at https://github.com/whz847/MDPNet. The proposed framework exhibits significant advantages in integrating heterogeneous features from multi-modal MRI data. Experimental results from internal datasets further validate the model's superior generalizability and clinical utility in assisting glioma diagnosis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Chromosome 16p13.3 deletions cause a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, ATR-16 syndrome. The classic phenotype of ATR-16 syndrome includes either alpha-thalassemia trait or hemoglobin H disease and intellectual disability; however, considerable variable expressivity has been reported with some patients having only an alpha-thalassemia disorder and others exhibiting a more severe phenotype with additional features. We describe an adult male with ATR-16 syndrome (due to an unbalanced <i>de novo</i> translocation involving chromosomes 11p15.5 and 16p13.3) who developed cognitive decline and increasing dyskinetic movements in his late twenties. Biochemical investigations and exome sequencing did not elucidate an alternative explanation for this decline. Furthermore, neither the deletion on chromosome 16 nor the duplication on chromosome 11 encompassed genes that could explain the decline. While cognitive decline has not been previously reported in ATR-16 syndrome, this may be another feature of the condition that is subject to variable expressivity. Taking this together with the apparent increased prevalence of dementia in other neurodevelopmental conditions, we hypothesize that individuals with ATR-16 syndrome may be predisposed to early cognitive decline."

    "title": "Influence of genetic factors of humans, mosquitoes and parasites, on the evolution of Plasmodium falciparum infections, malaria transmission and genetic control methods: a review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Despite significant progress, malaria remains a public health problem in many regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This situation is partly explained by the mosquito's resistance to insecticides and the emergence of parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs. Indeed, in spite of the various vectors' controls, insecticide resistance emerges from multi-generational selection and poses worldwide concern. In parallel, artemisinin resistance unfortunately emerged independently in multiple countries in eastern Africa. Since 2014, artemisinin resistance has been observed in 6 countries in Africa and, more concerningly, the evidence from longitudinal molecular surveys in these countries suggests that it is spreading. While phenotypic evidence of treatment failure is still limited, the increasing reports of validated artemisinin resistance mutations are alarming. Unlike the emergence of artemisinin resistance in South-East Asia, our understanding of the genetic determinants of artemisinin resistance and our ability to sequence and map the spread of resistance are significantly greater. In addition to mosquito and parasite genetics affecting malaria evolution, many human individual variants have been identified that are associated with malaria protection, but the most important of all relates to the structure or function of red blood cells, the classical polymorphisms that causes sickle cell trait, α-thalassaemia, G6PD deficiency, and the major red cell blood group variants. In that biological complex context, there is a need to characterize the various genetic factors in Plasmodium falciparum, humans and mosquitoes that are potentially associated with resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides, and their involvement in the evolution, severity and transmission of malaria. In this direction, A comprehensive literature review was conducted to capture the objectives highlighted above. The advances in genomic surveillance and emerging genetic control strategies, such as gene drive technology were also considered in this review. We used search engines such as PubMed and Google scholar to retrieve articles useful to the objective of this paper and information on the knowledge of genetic factors and methods that contributed to malaria control were synthesized."

This study aims to investigate the clinical significance of miR-17-3p in β-thalassemia, and to elucidate its regulatory effect on erythropoiesis and γ-globin expression. We collected peripheral blood samples from 17 patients with β-thalassemia (including intermedia and major subtypes) and 17 healthy controls, and the expression levels of miR-17-3p, BCL11 transcription factor A (BCL11A) and γ-globin were detected by qRT-PCR, and their correlations were analyzed. The regulation of miR-17-3p on BCL11A was evaluated in K562 cells by bioinformatics, luciferase reporter gene assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization and Western blotting. Furthermore, the effects on miR-17-3p overexpression and knockdown on erythropoiesis including cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation of K562 cells were assessed by CCK-8, flow cytometry and benzidine blue staining. The expression of miR-17-3p was upregulated in patients with β-thalassemia, and was positively correlated with fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. BCL11A expression was reduced in β-thalassemia patients, and was negatively correlated with miR-17-3p and γ-globin expression. BCL11A was identified as a target gene of miR-17-3p, and was negatively regulated by miR-17-3p. Furthermore, miR-17-3p mediated the upregulation of γ-globin expression in K562 cells through BCL11A. In addition, neither overexpression nor knockdown of miR-17-3p appeared to affect cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis or erythroid differentiation of K562 cells in vitro. The upregulated miR-17-3p is associated with HbF in patients with β-thalassemia. Although miR-17-3p does not affect erythropoiesis, it promotes γ-globin expression by targeting BCL11A, suggesting that miR-17-3p may be a promising miRNA for the treatment of β-thalassemia."

This study aims to analyze the association between blood group genotyping and the incidence of hemolysis in people with thalassemia undergoing repeated transfusions. This is a cross-sectional study involving people with β-thalassemia major younger than 18 years old who received regular transfusion with intervals of 2-4 weeks and have received more than 20 units of transfusion. Participants with leukemia, lymphoproliferative diseases, diabetes, solid tumors, and immunosuppression disorders were excluded from the study. Genotyping examination was conducted using Allele-Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR ASP) while phenotyping was examined using immunoserology. Follow-up gene sequencing was conducted to observe the blood group variants. Hemolysis was assessed using several markers such as haptoglobin, free hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and hemoglobinuria, measured by Cobas C113, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and urinalysis. Clinical and laboratory data collection is completed. A total of 90 samples were collected, data analyses were undertaken, and the initial results were reported in September 2024. The results of this study will provide information on the blood groups' systems that can predict hemolysis occurrence in patients with β-thalassemia undergoing repeated transfusion. These data will contribute to the best possible patient care management and blood transfusion therapy, thereby reducing the risk of hemolysis and improving the quality of life for patients with thalassemia in Indonesia.

    "title": "Phenome-wide association study and functional annotation of hemoglobin A1c-associated variants in African populations.",
    "abstract": "Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measures the average blood sugar level over the past three months. As a vital biomarker of blood glucose levels, it is used to diagnose Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and monitor glycemic control. A heritability estimate of 47% to 59% suggests that about half of the variation in HbA1c levels can be attributed to genetic factors. Despite African populations being the most genetically diverse and unique for fine-mapping, there is a paucity of data on the genetic drivers of HbA1c in African individuals. In this study, we performed functional annotation and a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) of HbA1c-associated variants in two African populations. In this study, we utilized summary statistics of the HbA1c GWAS meta-analysis of 7,526 individuals from South Africa and Uganda to conduct a PheWAS using GWASATLAS. We also performed a functional analysis using the functional mapping and annotation (FUMA) tool. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were prioritized using the SNP2GENE function, while the gene expression patterns and shared molecular functions were explored in the GENE2FUNC. Three genome-wide significant loci were identified with the lead SNPs: rs6724428, rs148228241, and rs8045544 - mapped to GULP1, HBA1, and ITFG3 genes, respectively. The minor allele frequencies of rs148228241 (0.07) and rs8045544 (0.19) are rare or non-existent in non-African populations. Both rs8045544 and rs148228241 are significantly associated with the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). A lower MCHC is associated with alpha thalassaemia, resulting from deletions in HBA1 and HBA2 genes. Such deletions are prevalent in malaria-endemic regions of Africa due to their selective survival advantage. The rs6724428 variant is associated with skeletal functions, reflecting the link between glucose metabolism and bone mineral density. Our findings highlight the interplay between glucose metabolism, erythropoiesis, and skeletal health. The significant associations of HbA1c-variants with both skeletal function and MCHC underscore the potential of these variants to impact broader physiological processes. A large-scale study of African individuals will be essential to unravel genetic variants influencing HbA1c."

    "abstract": "Varicocoele is a common cause of male infertility, affecting spermatogenesis through increased testicular temperature, venous stasis, and oxidative stress. Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy improves semen quality, whereas intrauterine insemination is widely used for mild male factor infertility. The comparative efficacy of these treatments in varicocoele patients with mild semen abnormalities remains unclear. To evaluate the efficacy of microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy and intrauterine insemination in improving clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in varicocoele patients with mild semen abnormalities and assess post-operative improvements in semen parameters following microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy. A retrospective cohort study involving 650 microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy patients from five medical centers and 700 intrauterine insemination patients from one center was conducted. Inclusion criteria included varicocoele diagnosed via ultrasonography, mild semen abnormalities (total motile sperm count ≥5 million), and at least one abnormal semen parameter. Primary outcomes were clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Secondary outcomes included sperm concentration, motility, and total motile sperm count changes post-microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and logistic regression. Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy patients demonstrated significant improvements in sperm concentration (35.2-43.3 × 10⁶/mL), motility (26%-38%), and total motile sperm count (18.8-34.9 × 10⁶, p < 0.001). Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were higher in the microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy group (35.23% and 31.08%) compared to the intrauterine insemination group (29.57% and 24.00%, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy significantly increased pregnancy (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.12-1.83, p < 0.05) and live birth rates (OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.21-2.02, p < 0.05). Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy significantly enhances semen quality and achieves superior clinical pregnancy and live birth rates compared to intrauterine insemination for varicocoele patients with mild semen abnormalities. These findings suggest that microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy is a more effective treatment option, highlighting the importance of individualized treatment strategies and supporting the preferential use of surgical intervention in this specific patient population."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord compression (SCC) secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) represents a rare but critical manifestation in patients with hematologic conditions, including β-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI). While there is no standard guideline due to the rarity of EMH-induced SCC, this case report documents successful management with radiotherapy while avoiding high-risk surgical intervention. The patient was a 17-year-old male with β-TI who developed debilitating SCC attributable to a paraspinal EMH mass. Due to concerns regarding surgical morbidity, a 26Gy 13-session course of radiation was administered alongside adjunctive blood transfusions, Hydroxyurea, and Glucocorticoids. Marked improvement and subsequent resolution of neurological deficits occurred rapidly following treatment, with sustained regression of the EMH mass over 18 months of follow-up. The case demonstrates that radiotherapy can be an effective primary treatment for EMH-induced SCC in β-TI, emphasizing its safety and efficacy when immediate and significant clinical response is required."

    "abstract": "Alpha Thalassemia/Mental developmental retardation, X-linked (ATRX) is an important heterochromatin regulator, frequent mutated in ATR-X syndrome and various cancers. ATRX binds a histone variant macroH2A, forming a functional axis crucial for transcription regulation and genome stability. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the ATRX-macroH2A interaction remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that the ADD domain of ATRX (ATRX <sub>ADD</sub>) specifically binds the histone-fold domain of macroH2A, but not the canonical H2A. The binding specificity is mediated by a D/E-rich loop of ATRX <sub>ADD</sub> and the L <sub>12</sub> loop of macroH2A. A swapping mutation in the L <sub>12</sub> loop of macroH2A disrupts ATRX binding, whereas the reverse mutation in H2A confers binding capacity with ATRX. Notably, ATRX <sub>ADD</sub> employs a conserved interface to recognize both macroH2A and H3, leading to competition between macroH2A and H3 for ATRX binding. Furthermore, affinity purification and mass spectrometry identify NuRD components as the potential ATRX <sub>ADD</sub>-associating proteins, with CDH4 mimicking H3 in its direct interaction with ATRX <sub>ADD</sub>. These findings elucidate the molecular basis of ATRX's interaction with macroH2A and NuRD, and also demonstrate the versatility of ATRX <sub>ADD</sub> in recognizing diverse chromatin regulators, providing insights into ATRX's multifaceted roles in epigenetic regulation and pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Lebanon's recent history has been marked by intersecting crises, including a severe economic collapse, the Beirut port explosion, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Amidst this \"polycrisis,\" the healthcare system has become increasingly reliant on international humanitarian assistance. This paper examines how these overlapping crises have affected the provision of care for children with thalassemia, a neglected non-communicable disease (NCD), within a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) paediatric unit operating in Lebanon between 2018 and 2023. Drawing on a single-case study design, the research explores the dynamics of power between state and non-state actors as well as within international humanitarian organizations and their approaches to healthcare delivery. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, including audio diaries, interviews, document analysis, and co-development groups involving 11 staff members and 18 caregivers of Syrian paediatric patients. Participants shared insights into operational challenges, decision-making processes, and the lived experiences of navigating Lebanon's collapsing health system. Findings reveal three interconnected issues: (1) the polycrises created an unsustainable environment even for resource-rich international non-governmental organizations (iNGOs); (2) the withdrawal of humanitarian services exacerbated the suffering of structurally marginalized Syrian families reliant on no-cost thalassemia treatment; and (3) national staff experienced profound professional and personal challenges as navigated tensions between iNGO policies and patient needs, often leading to burnout and reduced well-being. The study underscores the need for a reorientation of humanitarian healthcare models in protracted crises. This includes greater equity in decision-making between international organisations and national actors, longer-term planning for chronic disease care, and deeper engagement with national staff and affected communities. Prioritising sustainability, health justice, and the lived realities of both providers and patients is essential. While rooted in the specific context of Lebanon's highly privatised and pluralistic health system, these findings hold broader relevance for fragile settings facing similar structural and political constraints."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia major (βTM) frequently leads to endocrinological complications of chronic transfusion-induced iron overload, including growth hormone deficiency (GHD). With contrasting data on GHD in adult βTM populations, our study aimed to reevaluate the diagnosis of GHD using multiple tests and its progression over time. Two experimental studies were conducted in adult βTM patients to assess GH secretory status. The first study reevaluated GH secretion after two years using a GHRH plus arginine test performed initially and during follow-up. The second study applied a glucagon stimulation test to those initially diagnosed with severe GHD, comparing the results with those of a GHRH plus arginine test. The first study involved 80 patients: 67 patients had normal GH secretion at the first test, confirmed in 57 of them. Of the 13 initially diagnosed with GHD, only 3 were confirmed at the second test. The second study included 91 patients: 18 of the initially identified as having severe GHD, were tested with another challenge, but only 6 confirmed severe GHD, suggesting a possible risk of overdiagnosis in initial evaluations. The marked variability in GHD diagnoses among adult patients with βTM highlights the need for multiple diagnostic tests to improve accuracy and avoid unnecessary interventions. Our findings highlight the importance of reassessing GH secretory reserves with multiple tests at multiple time points, supporting a cautious approach to hormone replacement therapy, suggesting to start it only when clearly indicated."

    "abstract": "Mutations in Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) have been implicated in several cancers, including gliomas, sarcomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and other mesenchymal malignancies. ATRX loss contributes to oncogenesis, accelerates tumor growth, and reduces survival by disrupting epigenetic and telomere mechanisms. Additionally, ATRX loss can increase tumor sensitivity to treatment therapies. While research has explored ATRX expression in many cancers, data on its relationship to prognosis in pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) remain inconsistent. This systematic review aims to summarize all available studies on ATRX mutations and expression in PitNETs. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases was conducted to identify publications between 2014 and 2025 that investigated ATRX mutations or expression in PitNETs, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Of 32 identified studies, ten met the inclusion criteria, covering a total of 513 PitNETs. Only 20 tumors (3.9%) showed a loss of ATRX expression. Among these, 60% exhibited corticotrophic pathology, while 20% displayed lactotrophic pathology. A small subset of tumors (30%) was classified as pituitary carcinomas with aggressive and proliferative characteristics. Additionally, 10% demonstrated the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) phenotype, 50% had concurrent TP53 mutations, and 25% had elevated Ki-67 indices, indicating a higher proliferative index. Although ATRX mutations are rare in PitNETs, tumors with ATRX loss tend to be more aggressive and exhibit proliferative and transformative properties. Due to the limited number of cases, further studies with larger, prospective cohorts are needed to better understand the role of ATRX loss in PitNET progression and aggressiveness."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is an inherited hematological disorder characterized by chronic anemia and multisystem involvement, including potential impacts on the central nervous system. Research has suggested a relationship between thalassemia and glymphatic system dysfunction, which may contribute to neurocognitive impairments. However, the exact mechanisms linking thalassemia to changes in glymphatic function remain unclear. To investigate the relationship between glymphatic system function and thalassemia severity, particularly in patients with transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. The study included a population of 40 thalassemia patients (TM, n = 40) confirmed through genetic testing, consisting of 19 patients who were transfusion-dependent (TDT, n = 19) and 21 patients who were non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT, n = 21), along with 39 healthy controls (HC, n = 39) matched for age and sex. Glymphatic function was assessed using the index for diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS-index), with regions of interest selected from the medullary veins and crossing fibers in the lateral ventricles. Statistical analyses were performed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for intergroup comparisons, supplemented by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Pearson correlation was utilized to explore the relationships between the diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index and demographic factors, while multiple linear regression was employed to adjust for confounding variables. A significance threshold of P less than 0.05 was established for all statistical tests. The mean DTI-ALPS Index for thalassemia patients were significantly lower than those of healthy controls, indicating impaired glymphatic function. No significant differences in DTI-ALPS Index were found between transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion-dependent groups. Correlation analysis showed minimal influence of age and education on glymphatic function in the study population. This study demonstrates significant impairment in glymphatic system function in thalassemia patients, potentially related to chronic anemia and iron overload. These findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited autosomal recessive monogenic blood disorder characterized by red blood cell sickling responsible for recurrent vaso-occlusive crises and chronic hemolysis. Clinical manifestations vary and SCD patients experience increased morbidity and mortality. In Italy, SCD patients cluster into two distinct subpopulations: those of sub-Saharan African descent and those of Caucasian descent. Most sub-Saharan African SCD patients are children or young adults and carry the homozygous genotype hemoglobin (Hb) S, or SC, whereas Caucasian SCD patients tend to be older and have predominantly HbS/β-thalassemia. Patients of African descent typically present with acute SCD-related events, including vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, anemia, fever, and pneumonia. Caucasian patients, according to the different distribution of SCD genotypes, may exhibit either acute episodes or chronic long-term complications. Regardless of age, genotype, or ethnic background, most SCD patients in Italy are undiagnosed, and pain, fatigue and anemia should be regarded as presenting signs and symptoms of this disease. The tests needed to diagnose SCD are simple, and a complete blood count together with erythrocyte morphology, wherever available, hemolysis markers, should be performed whenever SCD is suspected. If a patient presents with two risk factors -family history, ethnicity, or a significant clinical feature - a first-level screening test (e.g. assessment of Hb fractions with HPLC), where available, should be performed immediately, or a referral should be provided. Here, we present an overview of the clinical features of SCD that may be encountered in real-world clinical practice in Italy from a practical perspective. This narrative review may aid non-specialist physicians in identifying disparate clinical conditions that may be symptoms or signs of SCD."

While previous studies have shown improvement in skin scarring with Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) administration, its potential in wound healing remains unexplored. Alginate-Carboxymethyl Cellulose (Alg-CMC) hydrogel incorporated with varying concentrations of Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) was prepared and characterized using various techniques. The wound-healing properties of the hydrogel were assessed through in vitro and in vivo and molecular assays. The non-toxic concentration of Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) for further investigation was determined. Hemocompatibility was consistent across samples, and the pH of Alg-CMC-BTX-A closely resembled healthy skin at below 7. While cell migration was slower in the BTX-A group (39.81 %) compared to the Alg-CMC-BTX-A groups (57.61 %). In vivo and histological analysis confirmed 100 % wound closure and the formation of a scar-free epithelial layer following Alg-CMC-BTX-A treatment. Molecular analysis supported these findings. The incorporation of Alginate and Carboxymethyl Cellulose (Alg-CMC) with Botulinum toxin type A in a wound dressing promotes tissue regeneration and minimizes scar formation by creating a proper environment for healing. Alg-CMC acts as a suitable carrier for botulinum toxin A. Alginate and Carboxymethyl Cellulose (Alg-CMC) with Botulinum toxin type A have good reparative and anti-scarring effects.

The primary aim of the present study is to identify tissue-based gene biomarkers pertinent to AIGVHD, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and exploration of potential therapeutic targets. The dataset was obtained from the GEO database. DEGs were identified, followed by GO and KEGG pathways analysis for the common DEGs. PPI networks and WGCNA analysis were used to identify essential genes, and correlations between critical genes and immune cell infiltration were also examined. The diagnostic efficacy of these essential genes was evaluated using ROC curves, leading to the development of 11 machine learning models based on this gene set. Furthermore, we established a mouse model of aGVHD, which was identified by clinical score, pathological analysis, flow cytometry detection of implantation rate, and immunohistochemical detection of CD4 expression. Finally, we measured the mRNA expression levels of the key genes in the mice's intestinal tissue using real-time PCR. DEGs showed a marked enrichment in immune and inflammatory response pathways. Our analysis identified three key genes, FCGR3A, SERPING1, and IFITM3, which were positively associated with M1 macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. Subsequently, we developed machine learning models utilizing these three genes and found that the RF model exhibited a robust predictive capacity for AIGVHD occurrence, achieving an AUC of 0.9802 (95% CI: 0.966-0.9945). An aGVHD mouse model was also successfully created, and we discovered that the aGVHD group's mRNA expression levels of three key genes were noticeably higher than the control group's.

Additionally, evidence regarding the possible effects and mechanisms of action of two major AGE components, S-allyl cysteine (SAC) and S-1-propenyl-l-cysteine (S1PC), is reviewed. The proposed molecular targets of SAC and S1PC are IKKβ kinase, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 complex, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, histone deacetylase and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Targeting these molecules causes a marked reduction in NF-κB activity accompanied by a notable decrease in the transcription of NF-κB-regulated genes. Another main objective of the present review was to discuss the possibility that AGE and its bioactive components could be employed in the treatment of several human pathologies that are characterized by a hyperinflammatory state resulting from dysregulation of the TLR4 and NF-κB pathways. SAC is of interest in the treatment of lung pathologies, neurological diseases, osteoarthritis, muscular atrophy, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. Additionally, the anti-oxidative activities of AGE, SAC and S1PC are compatible with their employment in the treatment of diseases characterized by oxidative stress, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia."

Their clinical manifestations range from anemia to more severe forms associated with neurological impairments. These complications can result as secondary consequences of the disease's clinical manifestations or be directly linked to genetic mutations. In this study, we present two families with neurological impairments who were referred to us for complementary hematological and biochemical analyses. Complete blood count, methemoglobin level, and methemoglobin reductase activity were assessed. Molecular analyses were performed using whole-exome sequencing, and the segregation of the identified mutations was confirmed with direct sequencing. Their pathogenicity and conservation were evaluated using various bioinformatics tools. Clinical and hematological findings suggested X-linked alpha-thalassemia/impaired intellectual development syndrome in the first family and recessive congenital methemoglobinemia type II in the second. This was confirmed by the identification of pathogenic mutations <i>ATRX</i>: p.Arg2131Gln and <i>CYB5R3</i>: p.Ala179Thr, respectively. Although these variants have been previously reported worldwide, they were identified for the first time in our population. Our results contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of these rare disorders and provide a basis for diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling. The mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to neurological symptoms are discussed."

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Red blood cell (RBC) parameters are routinely used to screen for α- and β-thalassemia traits as part of prenatal diagnosis for severe fetal thalassemia in countries with a high prevalence of the disease. In clinical practice, the same cut-off values for these parameters are applied to both females and males. However, given that the normal reference ranges for some RBC parameters differ significantly between sexes, sex-specific cut-off values may be more appropriate, especially in combination. To date, the effectiveness of RBC indices in males for predicting α- and β-thalassemia traits has not been evaluated. The objectives of this study are to assess the diagnostic performance of individual and combined RBC parameters in detecting α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia traits among non-anemic males. <b>Methods</b>: This diagnostic study is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from our project on prenatal control of severe thalassemia. The study population comprised male partners of pregnant women who underwent thalassemia screening during their first antenatal visit. RBC parameters, including hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), and RBC count, were measured for each participant. Carrier status for the α0-thalassemia Southeast Asian (SEA) genotype was confirmed by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method. The diagnostic performance of each RBC parameter and their combinations, based on predictive models generated using logistic regression, was evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. <b>Results</b>: A total of 486 Thai males were recruited for the study, including 137 individuals with the α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia trait and 349 with a normal α-thalassemia genotype (control group). All RBC parameters, except for Hct, differed significantly between the two groups. Among the individual indices, MCH exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy, followed by MCV, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.981 and 0.973, respectively. An MCH cut-off value of 26 pg and an MCV cut-off value of 80 fL provided a sensitivity of 100% for both indices, with specificities of 88.5% and 86.8%, respectively. The combination predictive model provided the best diagnostic performance, achieving an AUC of 0.987, which was slightly but significantly higher than that of any individual parameter. This model yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a significantly higher specificity of 90.8% at a cut-off probability of 7.0%. <b>Conclusions</b>: MCH and MCV demonstrated excellent screening performance for identifying α0-thalassemia carriers in males. However, the combination model exhibited even greater accuracy while reducing the false-positive rate. Implementing this model could minimize the need for unnecessary PCR testing, leading to substantial cost savings."

They comprised 22 (68.75%) AATA(--AA) carriers, 2 (6.25%) compounds with 3.7 deletion, 2 (6.25%) compounds with --SEA deletion, 1 (3.12%) AATA(--AA) homozygote, and 3 (9.37%) compounds of Hb Adana, Hb CS, and Hb Pakse with co-inheritance Hb E, respectively. Most of the patients with AATA(--AA) compounds with the α-variant exhibited a significant phenotype between moderate to severe thalassaemia, especially cases with compound α<sup>-AA</sup>α/α<sup>Adana</sup>α. <b>Conclusions</b>: AATA(--AA) is a significant pathogenic variant that should be diagnosed to prevent significant thalassaemia phenotype or transfusion-dependent thalassaemia."

    "abstract": "Cilia are evolutionarily conserved, microtubule-based organelles characterized by their ultrastructures and diverse functional roles, including developmental signaling, mechanosensation, and fluid propulsion. They are widely distributed across cell surfaces and play crucial roles in cell cycle regulation and tissue homeostasis. Despite advances in studying their molecular regulation and functions, demonstrating the precise ultrastructure of cilia remains a challenge. Recent novel microscopy techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and volume electron microscopy, are revolutionizing our understanding of their architecture and mechanochemical signaling. By integrating findings from different methodologies, this review highlights how these advances bridge basic research and clinical applications and provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural organization, functional mechanisms, and dynamic changes of cilia."

    "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To investigate the physical growth status of pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and analyze the effects of treatment-related and socioeconomic factors on physical growth. <b>Methods:</b> Based on the specialized thalassemia database from gene therapy clinical research at the Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, we collected data on height and weight development, family economic status, and medical records of 338 pediatric patients with TDT from October 2023 to May 2024. The length/height-for-age and body mass index (BMI) -for-age were classified based on the Growth Standard for Children under 7 Years of Age, Standard for Height Level Classification among Children and Adolescents Aged 7-18 Years, and Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the effects of family economic status and disease-related treatment on length/height-for-age and BMI-for-age. <b>Results:</b> Among the 338 patients, 118 were children and 220 were adolescents (192 males and 146 females), with a median age of 12 years (range: 0.8-18) and a median diagnosis duration of 10.3 years (range: 0.5-17.9). Subtypes included α-thalassemia [21 cases (6.2%) ], β-thalassemia [288 cases (85.2%) ], and combined αβ-thalassemia[29 cases (8.6%) ]. The monthly household income of patients was concentrated in 3 000-5 000 yuan (39.9%) and 5 001-10 000 yuan (34.9%), whereas 67.2% of the families had monthly medical expenses of <3 000 yuan. Of the patients, 75.5% received their first transfusion before 1 year of age. The proportions of children and adolescents with pretransfusion hemoglobin (HGB) of ≤70 g/L were 4.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Adolescents demonstrated significantly higher rates of transfusion frequency of <4 weeks/session, monthly red blood cell infusion of >2 U, serum ferritin (SF) of ≥5 000 μg/L, iron chelation therapy, and splenectomy compared with children (all <i>P</i><0.05). Of the 338 patients, 26.0%, 22.8%, and 8.9% demonstrated stunted growth, underweight, and concurrent stunted growth with underweight, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the stunted growth rates between children (22.9%) and adolescents (27.7%) (<i>P</i>=0.402). However, the underweight rate in adolescents (26.8%) was significantly higher than that in children (15.3%) (<i>P</i>=0.023). The multivariate analysis determined the following risk factors for stunted growth: monthly household income of <10 000 yuan (5 001-10 000 yuan: <i>OR</i>=5.49, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.48-35.76; 3 000-5 000 yuan: <i>OR</i>=6.87, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.88-44.60; <3 000 yuan: <i>OR</i>=9.29, 95% <i>CI</i>: 2.20-64.77), pretransfusion HGB of ≤70 g/L (<i>OR</i>=3.25, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.07-10.18), and SF of ≥5 000 μg/L (<i>OR</i> = 3.04, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.20-7.70). Longer diagnostic duration was associated with underweight (<i>OR</i>=1.10, 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.01-1.20) . <b>Conclusions:</b> Children and adolescents with TDT with pretransfusion SF of ≥5 000 μg/L, HGB of ≤70 g/L, low monthly household income, or longer diagnosis duration were significantly more likely to experience delayed physical growth."

    "abstract": "Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant depleted in thalassemia as a result of iron overload. We investigated the efficacy and safety of vitamin E as an adjuvant therapy to iron chelators in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients in relation to tissue iron overload and examine its potential corrective value to oxidative stress markers including peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2). This randomized prospective study included 180 pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia who were equally divided into three groups to either receive desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) or deferasirox (DFX). Patients in each group were further randomized to receive vitamin E supplementation (400 mg daily) or matching placebo. Patients were followed-up for 12 months with assessment of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and PRDX2), serum ferritin (SF), liver iron content (LIC) and cardiac T2∗ by magnetic resonance imaging. The primary endpoint was the change between groups from baseline to 12 months as regards LIC. After vitamin E therapy, transfusion index, SF and LIC were significantly decreased while hemoglobin and cardiac T2∗ were elevated compared with baseline levels or placebo group. MDA levels were decreased while the studied antioxidants were improved after vitamin E supplementation compared with baseline levels or placebo. DFX-treated patients had the highest hemoglobin level with the lowest SF, LIC and MDA levels compared with DFO or DFP subgroups. Vitamin E is a safe adjuvant anti-oxidant therapy that potentiates the efficacy of DFX in reducing iron burden in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia patients. This trial was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no. NCT06509581."

    "abstract": "Variability in blood donors, components, and recipients are known to affect transfusion outcomes, yet the combined effects of these factors remains unclear. The Red Blood Cell - Improving Transfusions for Chronically Transfused Recipients (RBC-IMPACT) study was a multi-center longitudinal study conducted in the United States (US) and Brazil over two years to investigate RBC survival after transfusion (Aim 1) and acute increase in iron post transfusion (Aim 2) (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05255445). The US RBC-IMPACT study included patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) and, in Aim 2 only, children with hematology-oncology diseases with a hypoproliferative bone marrow. In Brazil, the study was conducted within an established SCD cohort. Blood samples were collected immediately before and after RBC transfusion to measure hemoglobin (Hb), hemoglobin A (HbA) in SCD, and markers of iron and hemolysis. Samples were collected two hours post transfusion in a subset of participants receiving primarily single unit transfusions for Aim 2. Transfusate samples were collected from transfused units. Single nucleotide polymorphism array typing of donors and recipients to measure genetic variants including those associated with increased in vitro hemolysis of stored RBCs was conducted. Comprehensive information regarding donors, components and some recipient data were linked to key clinical data extracted from recipients' medical records to assess factors associated with RBC transfusion effectiveness. The outcomes for Aim 1 were RBC survival between successive transfusions, calculated as ΔHbA per day for SCD and by ΔHb per day for thalassemia, and Δbilirubin for both patient groups. The primary outcome for Aim 2 was change in serum iron from before to 2 hours after transfusion. This study will be the most detailed and granular evaluation of the predictive variables that may optimize RBC effectiveness and safety in these chronically transfused patient populations."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus has been knowingly associated with increased risk of fractures, so much so that skeletal fragility is considered a complication of diabetes. Determinants of bone fragility in this chronic condition are several, and the diabetes treatment choice could influence bone metabolism. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have recently expanded the therapeutic armamentarium for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D); these antihyperglycemic drugs act by reducing renal glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule and have a proven cardiorenal benefit. The role of SGLT2i towards phospho-calcium metabolism is still unclear, so we aimed to review the current evidence of the relationship between SGLT2i and calcium and phosphate homeostasis. The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases were searched to identify original research articles, meta-analyses, and scientific reviews on effects on bone metabolism in T2D patients treated with SGLT2i. Emerging data indicate that SGLT2i may lead to a rise of bone turnover markers, promoting a lower skeletal bone density and an increased fracture risk on murine models, but in real-world studies, results are controversial. Therefore, more clinical trials are needed to further clarify this topic, and the effects of SGLT2i on calcium homeostasis remain to date poorly understood."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is a severe inherited anemia characterized by impaired synthesis of hemoglobin chains. Disease progression and TDT severity are potentially linked to oxidative stress and protein damage. This study aimed to explore the expression patterns of ceruloplasmin (CP), α2-macroglobulin (A2M), and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) in TDT serum through quantitative proteomic profiling. The results were validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The study participants were divided into three groups based on the duration of blood transfusion. Age and gender-matched normal individuals served as controls. The results revealed the downregulation of these proteins. The reduced levels of these proteins may contribute to tissue damage in TDT patients, primarily due to increased oxidative stress. For example, decreased CP levels can disrupt iron and copper metabolism, leading to heightened oxidative stress and rendering red blood cell membranes more susceptible to rupture due to active oxygen radicals. In summary, CP, A2M, and AHSG association with iron metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress underscores their potential relevance in understanding TDT's pathogenesis and progression. These findings may pave the way for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for TDT patients."

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in thalassaemia care, survival rates and complications vary significantly by genotype. This study assesses survival outcomes and associated complications in patients with thalassaemia in north-eastern Thailand. A longitudinal cohort study from October 2012 to September 2023 involved patients aged ≥10 years (median: 31 years, range: 20-74) attending Srinagarind and Udonthani Hospitals. Cox regression analyses identified predictors of survival and complications. Of 380 enrolled patients, 340 completed follow-up. Over 10 years, 39 patients (11.4%) died, primarily from cardiovascular complications (61.5%), at a median age of 45 years (range: 22-72). Patients were grouped as HbE/β-thalassaemia, HbH/HbHCS with HbE mutation and HbH/HbHCS. Survival at 60 years was lower in HbE/β-thalassaemia (55.9%) and HbH/HbHCS with HbE mutation (58.3%) compared to HbH/HbHCS (79.6%, p = 0.08). Significant predictors of mortality included cardiovascular complications (HR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.01-5.5; p = 0.04), recurrent bacterial infections (HR 7.6; 95% CI, 3.1-18.8; p < 0.001) and elevated ferritin (>2500 ng/mL; HR 2.0; 95% CI, 1.01-3.9; p = 0.04). Cardiovascular complications, recurrent bacterial infections and high ferritin levels significantly influence survival in thalassaemia patients. Deletional alpha-thalassaemia patients had superior survival, while HbE/β-thalassaemia and non-deletional alpha-thalassaemia or co-inherited HbE mutation had poorer outcomes, underscoring the need for genotype-specific management strategies."

This analytic case-control study was conducted at two centers in Tehran, Iran, involving 80 thalassemia patients (case group) and 80 healthy individuals (control group), matched by sex and age (15-25 years). Demographic data, OHI-S, and CPI were collected from all participants. For group comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed data, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was employed for multiple comparisons. Multiple logistic regression and ANOVA were also applied. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20, with a significance level set at 0.05. The two groups showed statistically significant differences in the CPI and OHI-S indexes (p < 0.05). The multiple logistic regression model revealed that thalassemia affects the OHI-S index but not the CPI index. Patients with thalassemia major experience more severe periodontal disease than healthy individuals. Given the study's limitations, further research is recommended to investigate the risk factors for periodontal problems in thalassemia patients."

In Indonesia, anemia is a public health concern with a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and infectious disease factors. The prevalence tends to increase in Indonesia from 2007 to 2018. This study aims to explore factors contributing to anemia in Indonesia. We used archived data from various population studies collected between 1995 and 2023. A total of 5,486 subjects from 17 study populations in Indonesia were included in the analyses. The proportions of anemic women are higher than anemic men (p<0.001), and the anemia prevalence in Indonesia is diverse in various populations. More than 50% of this study subjects were microcytic hypochromic anemia with 35% indicative of iron deficiency and 13% of thalassemia based on Mentzer Index and RDW index cut-off. Hb analysis showed that HbA2 and HbF proportions above normal were significantly higher in the anemic group (p<0.001). We also found beta thalassemia proportions were higher in the anemic group (p<0.001) indicating genetic disorders are prevalent in Indonesia. The anemia prevalence in Indonesia is high, and the etiology is very complex, with nutritional and non-nutritional factors. Therefore, anemia mitigation in the Indonesian population should consider nutritional and non-nutritional factors. Policy makers should consider intervention programs beyond nutrient-specific strate-gies such as genetic background of the individuals."

    "abstract": "Avatrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), taken with food without any specific restrictions, approved for the treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of avatrombopag for children and adolescents with persistent and chronic primary ITP. AVA-PED-301 is a global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3b study. Children and adolescents aged ≥1 to <18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of primary ITP for at least 6 months and an insufficient response to a previous treatment were randomly assigned (3:1) to avatrombopag (aged ≥6 years: 20 mg oral tablet once daily; aged ≥1 to <6 years: 10 mg oral suspension once daily) or matching placebo. Doses were titrated to maintain a platelet count of 50-150 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L. The core-phase (12-week double-blind treatment period) full analysis set included all randomly assigned patients; efficacy analysis was performed based on randomised study drug. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug in each study phase. The primary endpoint was durable platelet response (proportion of patients with at least six out of eight weekly platelet counts ≥50 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L during the last 8 weeks of the 12-week treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy); the alternative primary endpoint was platelet response (proportion of patients with at least two consecutive platelet assessments ≥50 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells per L over the 12-week treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy). The trial core phase is complete and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04516967). Between March 2, 2021, and Aug 2, 2023, 83 children were screened, with 75 randomly assigned to avatrombopag (n=54; 24 [44%] female; 48 [89%] White) or placebo (n=21; 12 [57%] female; 15 [71%] White). 15 (28%) patients in the avatrombopag group met the primary endpoint of durable platelet response versus no (0%) patients in the placebo group (difference in response rate 28% [95% CI 16-40]; p=0·0077); 44 (81%) patients in the avatrombopag group met the alternative primary endpoint of platelet response versus no (0%) patients in the placebo group (difference in response rate 81% [71-92]; p<0·0001). The most common adverse events across treatment groups were petechiae (n=20), epistaxis (n=16), and headache (n=14). Serious adverse events were reported in five (9%) patients in the avatrombopag group and one (5%) patient in the placebo group. No deaths, thromboembolic events, or grade 3 or higher bleeding events were reported. Avatrombopag is an effective oral treatment for children and adolescents with ITP for at least 6 months and has a reassuring safety profile in the paediatric population. Avatrombopag could provide an important treatment option for paediatric ITP. Sobi."

According to the results of the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), the percentage of microcytes (Micro%) and the standard deviation of the red blood cell distribution width (RDW-SD), 842 different adults were screened as suspect for HTZ HGP and underwent simultaneous morphological analysis of red blood cells (RBCMA) and haemoglobin fraction analysis. The majority (72.8 %) of HTZ HGP suspects presented a pathological EP, mostly compatible with a confirmed β-thalassaemia trait (50.1 %) or a heterozygous β-haemoglobin variant (12.2 %). MA were identified in 360 (42.8 %) samples and 70 (8.3 %) of these had 3 or more MA. The most common MA was poikilocytosis (28.1 %). Patients with at least 1 MA detected were more likely to have a pathological EP (p=0.003). However, correlation between the number of MA detected and the type of EP was negligible. Screening for HTZ HGP based on erythrocyte parameters measured on Sysmex XN analysers is a relevant tool with a positive predictive value of 72.8 % and definitely superior to microscopic RBCMA which now appears to be of low added value and obsolete in this indication."

Ninety samples with suspected δ-globin gene mutations from 15,642 participants were selected for further molecular analysis based on their Hb A<sub>2</sub> level (≦1.8%) and hematological parameters. Additionally, 37 samples with suspected δ-globin gene mutations were sent from other hospital to our laboratory for identification. GAP-PCR and PCR-reverse dot blot (PCR-RDB) were used to detect common α- and β-thalassemia in the Chinese population, and Sanger sequencing was used to identify δ-globin gene mutations. Among 15,642 samples examined, samples with δ-globin gene mutations were identified in 127 (0.81%) cases with as many as 28 different genotypes, including 81 (0.52%) cases of δ-thalassemia and 46 (0.29%) cases of δ-globin variants. The most prevalent δ-thalassemia and δ-globin variants of this study were <i>HBD</i>:c.-127T>C (75.3%, 61/81) and Hb A<sub>2</sub>-Melbourne (54.3%, 25/46).

Additionally, it may induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), ultimately resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To examine the transcriptional profiles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and T-cell exhaustion indicators in CD8+ T lymphocytes isolated from B-ALL patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 22 untreated B-ALL patients and 22 healthy controls. Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) was used to isolate CD8+ T lymphocytes. The relative gene expression was then assessed using qRT-PCR with primers specific to XBP1, CHOP, GLUT1, and T-bet. The ER stress response was significantly activated in CD8+ T lymphocytes from B-ALL patients, as evidenced by significant increase in both XBP1 and CHOP transcript levels, relative to normal donors. Although GLUT1 mRNA expression was significantly higher than in control groups, T-bet expression showed no significant difference between the two groups. Collectively, our gene expression data suggest ER stress activation in CD8+ T lymphocytes from B-ALL patients. These findings warrant further investigation into ER stress-related signaling pathways and their potential role in promoting T-cell exhaustion in B-ALL."

    "abstract": "The MNS7 (Mi<sup>a</sup>) is a low-prevalence antigen associated with GP.Mur hybrid glycophorin, which is high in Thai populations. Consequently, anti-Mi<sup>a</sup>, particularly anti-Mur caused by alloimmunisation is involved in transfusion medicine. In Thailand, before the first transfusion of transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia, typing of Mi<sup>a</sup> and Rh antigens is minimally required to provide phenotype-matched donors. A patient with Mi<sup>a</sup>-positive phenotype encoded by <i>GYP*Mur</i> homozygote (do not express GPB, JENU-negative) receiving either Mi<sup>a</sup>-negative or Mi<sup>a</sup>-positive phenotype can produce anti-JENU, leading to difficulty in locating compatible donors. Genotyping for <i>GYP*(B-A-B)</i> hybrid alleles to predict the JENU-negative phenotype is alternatively implemented. This study aimed to predict the JENU-negative phenotype in multitransfused Thai patients using PCR-based coupled DNA sequencing. Blood samples from 861 multitransfused Thai patients were included. Mi<sup>a</sup> antigen testing was performed using serology and PCR-sequence-specific primer. <i>GYP*</i>(<i>B-A-B</i>) hybrid alleles were analyzed using Sanger DNA sequencing. Only 5 of 68 patients receiving more than 40 red cell units developed alloantibodies. The sequence analysis revealed that 60 of 68 patients carried the <i>GYP*Mur</i> allele, including <i>GYP*Mur</i>/<i>GYPB</i> heterozygotes (86.76%) and the <i>GYP*Mur</i>/<i>GYP*Mur</i> homozygote (1.47%).

We examined the associations between medical factors (SCD genotype, silent infarct/stroke, etc), socioeconomic factors (insurance type), and neuropsychological outcomes (reading and math achievement, psychological symptoms) in youth with SCD. A chart review was conducted for 108 Black/African American youth with SCD (M<sub>age</sub> = 10.80, SD = 3.53, 54.6% males) referred for neuropsychological evaluation. Patients were administered Wechsler-series tests of intelligence and academic achievement. Psychological symptoms were measured using the caregiver report Child Behavior Checklist. Zero-order correlations, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and hierarchical linear regression models examined the associations between variables. Youth with less severe SCD genotypes (SC/SBeta+ thalassemia) had more externalizing problems. Youth with Medicaid/no insurance had more internalizing, externalizing, and somatic symptoms. Low full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) strongly predicted poor academic achievement scores above other factors. Results highlight the importance of early neuropsychological/psychosocial screenings in SCD."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by severe anemia and iron overload, which may affect brain microstructure. This study aims to investigate changes in the white matter (WM) microstructure of patients with β-thalassemia using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. The study included 40 patients with β-thalassemia (aged 18-45 years, mean age 30.65 years) and 40 healthy controls (aged 18-45 years, mean age 30.13 years). All participants underwent 3.0 T MRI scans. DTI data were processed using the FSL software package, focusing on the assessment of four indices: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for these indices to highlight the potential value of white matter regions in distinguishing between patient and control group. Compared to the control group, patients with β-thalassemia showed decreased FA and increased MD and RD in multiple white matter tracts. ROC curve analysis showed high AUC values for FA, MD, and RD (0.868, 0.854, and 0.847, respectively). The results suggest that patients with β-thalassemia may have widespread abnormalities in the white matter microstructure."

    "abstract": "A man in his 60s with dry eye symptoms was noted to have angioid streaks under the peripapillary retina. Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia was the major health issue throughout his life, requiring venesection for iron overload, but no transfusions for many years. Close inspection of the eyes with optical coherence tomography also detected small subclinical optic disc drusen, which have not been reported in association with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. Together, optic disc drusen and angioid streaks represent an ectopic calcification phenotype in the eye and can be seen in the more common inherited condition of pseudoxanthoma elasticum or other inherited haemolytic anaemias such as sickle cell or thalassaemia. These associations highlight the role of pyrophosphate as a physiological inhibitor of calcification, and deficiencies of serum pyrophosphate lead to excessive and ectopic calcification. This raises intriguing hypotheses for the treatment of optic disc drusen, angioid streaks and other conditions of ectopic calcification."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) with vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC) has a major impact on healthcare resource utilisation and poses a significant financial burden for the patients. This study examines the economic implications of managing VOC in individuals with SCD in India, from the perspectives of patients, healthcare system and society. This cross-sectional, observational study included 1000 patients with SCD across 14 centres enrolled from November 2021 to June 2022. Data were collected systematically using a structured electronic case record form. Employing a cost-of-illness approach, the study assessed the economic impact of SCD and VOC management, including assessing patient/caregiver costs, healthcare provider costs and societal burdens extrapolated to the larger SCD population in India. Patients incurred substantial out-of-pocket expenses, with a median (IQR) annual expenditure of INR 22 080/US$267 (IQR: INR 36 990/US$447.7), representing 14.65% (26.53) of their annual household income. Overall, catastrophic healthcare expenditure (CHE) for total annual average SCD care with VOC management was experienced by 624 patients (62.40%). Moreover, 334 patients (33.4%) experienced CHE of >25% of the annual household income. Patients with SCD with VOC had significantly higher median annual healthcare expenditures and used a higher median percentage of their yearly household income on healthcare compared with those without VOC (19.82% vs 6.08%; p<0.001). Cost incurred by healthcare providers for VOC management in different healthcare facilities (outpatient department/emergency department/intensive care unit) was similar across different reimbursed facilities (government tertiary care hospitals, non-governmental organisation-operated healthcare centres and government-subsidised healthcare setups). The estimated societal burden for VOC management in 1 year for 1000 patients visiting different healthcare facilities was around INR 35 119 074 (~US$0.42 million). These findings highlight the considerable economic strain on both patients and healthcare providers in SCD and VOC management, which is similar to the other non-communicable diseases emphasising the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve financial hardships among patients. The study was funded by Novartis Healthcare Private Limited."

    "abstract": "Opportunistic infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with immunodeficiency and malignancy. Cryptosporidium spp. and microsporidia, particularly Enterocytozoon bieneusi, are obligate intracellular parasites that can lead to severe complications and even death in immunocompromised individuals.In this cross-sectional study, 60 stool samples were collected from pediatric oncology patients aged 5-18 years who were hospitalized at Baghaei 2 Hospital in Ahvaz, southwestern Iran, in 2024. Following DNA extraction, molecular analysis was performed to detect the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi. For genotyping, amplification and sequencing of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene for Cryptosporidium spp. and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region for E. bieneusi were conducted. A total of 16 samples (26.6%) tested positive for either C. hominis or E. bieneusi. Co-infection with both pathogens was identified in two patients (3%). Statistical analysis revealed no significant association between gender and parasitic infection (P = 0.166), nor between the type of malignancy and presence of protozoa (P = 0.717). Genotyping of E. bieneusi showed the presence of BEB6, CHG3, D, and I genotypes, with BEB6 being the most prevalent. Subtyping of C. hominis revealed the presence of the IeA11G3T3 subtype. Overall, the molecular findings demonstrated a prevalence rate 26.6 % of parasitic infection among the studied population, with E. bieneusi being predominant. The detection of potentially zoonotic genotypes, particularly BEB6, underscores the likelihood of zoonotic transmission routes in these patients."

Physical examination revealed pallor, generalised lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and left-sided pleural effusion. Lymph node biopsy initially suggested Castleman disease-hyaline vascular variant. However, further evaluation led to a final diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus nephritis and concomitant β-thalassaemia trait. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge when multiple diseases with overlapping symptoms coexist and the importance of a comprehensive evaluation in patients with atypical presentations to avoid diagnostic overshadowing."

We analyzed the difference in the patient-centered medical experiences between public and private fertility care in China, aiming to provide data support and a decision-making basis for optimizing the allocation of reproductive health care resources, and improving patient experience and compliance. In this study, a multicenter cross sectional study was distributed among 1900 infertile Chinese patients at 10 reproductive medicine centres from July 2021 to April 2022. Patients' experiences of infertility patients were analyzed. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression model analysis were used to analysis the factors influencing the differences in patients' medical experiences between public and private fertility care. The questionnaire was completed by 1694 infertile couples (response rate of 89.16%) from 10 centres. Of the eight subscales, 'care organization' received the best ratings, and 'information' received the worst ratings. The total score of private fertility care was significantly higher than that of public fertility care. The subscale scores for 'accessibility', 'information' and 'continuity and transition' were significantly higher for private fertility care than for public fertility care. Further univariate and multivariate analyses found that the distance from the hospital, family income and pregnancy status were the main influencing factors of the patients' medical experiences with public fertility care, while the stage of fertility treatment, infertility duration and pregnancy status were the main influencing factors of the patients' medical experiences with private fertility care. The subscale of patient-centered medical experiences for 'accessibility', 'information' and 'continuity and transition' were significantly higher for private fertility care than for public fertility care."

    "abstract": "Mutations in adult hemoglobin alpha genes in humans lead to blood disorders commonly known as α-thalassemia. In search of a mouse model for this disease, mutagenesis screens have identified several deletions that resemble these phenotypes. The Hba<sup>b2(th)</sup> deletion, in particular, replicates the characteristics of alpha-thalassemia minor in heterozygous mice but presents a homozygous embryonic lethal phenotype. Previous analyses of Hba<sup>b2(th)</sup> mice suggested that the deletion affects both Hba genes (Hba-a1 and Hba-a2) and considered epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) or rhomboid 5 homolog 1 (Rhbdf1) to be responsible for the embryonic lethality. Molecular analysis of Hba<sup>b2(th)</sup> revealed a deletion spanning a 1 cM region of mouse chromosome 11. Importantly, the Hba<sup>b2(th)</sup> deletion does not extend to Egfr, indicating that the observed lethality of homozygous embryos is not due to the loss of Egfr. Sequence analysis of the Hba<sup>b2(th)</sup> deletion showed that the Hba-a2 gene is not deleted, but the lack of expression is likely due to the disruption of upstream regulatory regions. Furthermore, we identify Snrnp25, which codes for the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 25 (U11/U12), as the candidate gene most likely responsible for the peri-implantation lethality of Hba<sup>b2(th)</sup> homozygous mice. These findings enhance the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying α-thalassemia and provide insights into novel genes essential for early mammalian development."

    "abstract": "Non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT) can result in serious complications and comorbidities that can impact patients' quality of life. Mitapivat, a first-in-class, oral, small-molecule allosteric activator of red blood cell pyruvate kinase, is under investigation in adults with thalassaemia. Through its mechanism of action, mitapivat increases adenosine triphosphate, leading to improvements in red blood cell health, ineffective erythropoiesis and haemolysis. An open-label, multicentre, phase 2 study (NCT03692052) is evaluating mitapivat 100 mg twice daily in adults with NTDT. We previously reported a statistically significant haemoglobin response (a ≥1.0 g/dL increase in haemoglobin concentration from baseline at ≥1 assessments between Weeks 4 and 12 [inclusive]) during the 24-week core period. Here, we report efficacy and safety results up to Week 156 and to data cut-off date respectively. Of 20 patients enrolled, 17 continued in the extension period. Median change from baseline in haemoglobin concentration at Week 156 was 1.2 g/dL. Patients receiving mitapivat demonstrated sustained improvements in haemoglobin concentrations and markers of erythropoietic activity, haemolysis and iron homeostasis. Five patients (29%) had a grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse event; none were considered treatment related. Treatment with mitapivat was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of mitapivat in pyruvate kinase deficiency."

However, the performance evaluation or verification of this method remains unestablished, which is essential before clinical utility and panel registration. Here, we developed a classification method for thalassemia mutations, enabling automated interpretation, visual representation, and identification of diverse mutation types. We used a total of 36 samples, comprising 32 reference materials and four clinical samples to assess the performance of nanopore sequencing in identifying variants in terms of concordance, precision, and the lower limits of detection. Our analysis successfully identified 19 SNVs, six deletions, and two triplications using nanopore sequencing across all samples. Notably, these variants showed complete concordance of 100% with the genotypes of the reference materials and known results. The precision of nanopore sequencing for detecting thalassemia variants was consistently high, with neither false positive nor false negative observed. Furthermore, the lower limits of detection achieved in our study were 3 ng/μL. Overall, our study proved that the reference materials can be used to evaluate the performance of nanopore sequencing in identifying thalassemia mutations, and it is necessary to incorporate triplications when utilizing reference materials for performance evaluation of long-read sequencing. The consistent and robust performance of nanopore sequencing in this study demonstrates its potential as a reliable method for comprehensive variant detection in thalassemia and other genetic diseases diagnosis."

    "title": "[Rapid identification and analysis of hemoglobin isoelectric focusing electrophoresis images based on deep learning].",
    "abstract": "Gel electrophoresis is used to separate and analyze macromolecules （such as DNA， RNA， and proteins） and their fragments， and highly reproducible and efficient automatic band-detection methods have been developed to analyze gel images. Uneven background， low contrast， lane distortion， blurred band edges， and geometric deformation pose detection-accuracy challenges during automatic band detection. In order to address these issues， various correction algorithms have been proposed； however， these algorithms rely on researcher experience to adjust and optimize parameters based on image characteristics， which introduces human error while qualitatively and quantitatively processing bands. Isoelectric focusing （IEF） gel electrophoresis separates proteins with high-resolution based on isoelectric point （pI） differences. Microarray IEF （mIEF） is used for the auxiliary diagnosis of diabetes and adult <i>β</i>-thalassemia owing to operational ease， low sample consumption， and high throughout. This diagnostic method relies on accurately positioning and precisely determining protein bands. To avoid errors associated with correction algorithms during band analysis， this paper introduces a method for rapidly recognizing bands in gel electrophoresis patterns that relies on a deep learning object detection algorithm， and uses it to quantify and classify the IEF electrophoresis pattern of hemoglobin （Hb）. We used mIEF experiments to collect 1 665 pI-marker-free Hb IEF images as a model dataset to train the YOLOv8 model. The trained model accepts a Hb IEF image as input and infers band bounding boxes and classification results. Using inference data， the gray intensities of the pixels in each band area are summed to determine the content of each protein. The background and foreground of the image need to be separated prior to summing the abovementioned gray intensities， and the threshold method is used to achieve this. The threshold is defined as the average intensity of the background area， which is obtained by summing and averaging the background intensities of gel areas between the detection bounding boxes of each protein band. The baseline band areas are unified after removing the background. This method only requires the input image， directly outputs the corresponding electrophoretic band information， and does not rely on the experience of professionals nor is it affected by factors such as lane distortion or band deformation. In addition， the developed method does not depend on pI markers for qualitatively determining bands， thereby reducing experimental costs and improving detection efficiency. YOLOv8n delivered a detection accuracy of 92.9% and an inference time of 0.6 ms while using limited computing resources. Using Hb A2 as an example， we compared its content measured using the developed method with clinical data. The quantitative results were subjected to regression analysis， which delivered a linearity of 0.981 2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.980 0. We also used the Bland-Altman analysis method to verify that these two values are highly consistent. Compared with the traditional automatic band detection methods， the method developed in this study is fast， accurate， more repeatable， and stable， and can be used to determine the Hb A2 content in clinical practice， thereby potentially assisting in the auxiliary diagnosis of adult <i>β</i>-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "γ-globin genes (HBG1 and HBG2) are usually expressed during fetal life, and almost no expression after birth. Therefore, the reactivation of HBG is a key target for the treatment of hemoglobinopathy. ZFP64 is a C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factor, which has been shown to play an important role in the maintenance of gene expression in mixed lineage leukemia, and other C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factors (such as ZFP410 and ZFP644) have been shown to regulate the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in thalassemia. This study aims to investigate the effect of ZFP64 on mRNA expression of HBG. We performed bioinformatics analyses using the Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify genes and transcription factors associated with ZFP64. ZFP64 was knocked out in K562 and HUDEP-2 cell lines by CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation, and the transcription levels of ZFP64, HBB and HBG were analyzed. In undifferentiated and 7-day differentiated HUDEP-2 cells, knocking down ZFP64 resulted in a 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold increase in HBG mRNA expression, respectively (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that ZFP64 is a potential regulator of HBG expression and warrants further investigation as a therapeutic target in hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the prevalence of alpha+ thalassemia and its hematological indices in a newborn population in Mwanza city, North-western Tanzania. A cross-sectional study screened 803 newborns for alpha+ thalassemia that extracted DNA from dried blood spots using the Qiagen Mini Kit then analysed by multiplex PCR. Demographic data, anemia-related clinical information, and CBC parameters were collected at birth. Prevalence was determined by the proportion of newborns with the alpha+ thalassemia deletion. Fisher's Exact test assessed differences in demographic and clinical variables, while Student's t-tests and ANOVA evaluated hematological parameters. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Alpha thalassemia was detected in 49.6% (398/803) of neonates, with 38.6% heterozygous and 11.0% homozygous deletions. Significant differences in erythrocyte indices were observed across groups. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were lower in heterozygous (_α/αα) and homozygous (_α/_α) newborns (16.42±3.62 g/dl and 16.04±3.37 g/dl, respectively) compared to the αα/αα group (17.03±3.35 g/dl, p < 0.05). Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) was reduced in heterozygous (_α/αα) and homozygous (_α/_α) groups (99.23±9.12 μm³ and 94.75±9.88 μm³, respectively) compared to αα/αα (102.41±9.56 μm³, p < 0.0001). Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) followed a similar pattern, being lowest in the homozygous group (p ≤ 0.0001). Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) was higher in homozygous (_α/_α) newborns (10.03±1.22) compared to heterozygous (_α/αα) (9.57±0.79, p < 0.001). Leucocyte counts were significantly higher in heterozygous (_α/αα) newborns (13.91±12.14) compared to homozygous (_α/_α) (12.60±7.91) and αα/αα groups (11.26±9.76, p = 0.001). Alpha+ thalassemia is highly prevalent in North-western Tanzania and significantly affects blood indices. Neonatal screening is an effective tool for identifying affected children, especially in settings with high prevalence of a trait and low awareness of genetic inheritance."

This study aims to summarize the surgical techniques and perioperative experiences to provide clinical evidence for pediatric OTCT. This retrospective study reviewed the clinical data of 89 children who underwent umbilical single-incision laparoscopic oophorectomy at Children's Hospital, Capital Institute of Pediatrics between September 2020 and December 2024. The types of primary diseases were summarized, differences in preoperative complete blood count results, surgery methods and intraoperative conditions were explored among different primary diseases. Different surgical methods were reviewed. The surgery steps and techniques were summarized. The trends in surgical volume over time and the surgical learning curve were analyzed. The factors affecting follicle density were also explored. The primary diseases in this study included Turner syndrome, aplastic anemia, mucopolysaccharidosis in, chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, hematological malignancies, solid tumors, platelet dysfuction, metachromatic leukodystrophy, hemophagocytic syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome, beta-thalassemia, osteopetrosis, dermatomyositis, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and primary immunodeficiency. Children received chemotherapy will experience a decrease in white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil levels, necessitating granulocyte-stimulating therapy; children with aplastic anemia had a significant drop in hemoglobin level, thus requiring red blood cell transfusions; children with myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia showed a marked decrease in platelet levels, necessitating platelet transfusions. Children with Turner syndrome most commonly have the unclosed internal inguinal ring. The main steps of umbilical single-incision laparoscopic oophorectomy were incision, trocar placement, observation, suspension, dissection, removal, and incision closure. The number of umbilical single-incision laparoscopic oophorectomy had been increasing year by year. The learning curve analysis indicated that the first 35 cases were the learning and improvement phase. Follicular density was significantly correlated with age, primary disease and ovarian color. Pediatric OTCT has broad applications and a promising future. Perioperative preparation and the surgical process are important. It is necessary to adjust the complete blood cell count to ensure that WBC greater than 4*10^9/L, neutrophils greater than 1*10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than 70 g/L, and platelet greater than 100*10^9/L before surgery. Given the small volume of children's ovaries, it's necessary to remove the entire ovary. Energy devices can be utilized, however, it's essential to minimize mechanical, thermal damage, and warm ischemia time to the ovary, while also preserving surrounding tissues."

    "abstract": "Patients with thalassemia acquire cellular oxidative damage mainly from the degradation of excessive uncoupled hemoglobin (Hb) chains and iron overload. The oxidative damage of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets potentially results in the worsening of ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Vitamin E (VitE) is an antioxidant that inhibits membrane lipid peroxidation. It is widely used as a supplement in thalassemia; however, its benefits in improving cellular oxidative damage remain unclear. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20220801001) on 01/08/2022. We randomized transfusion-dependent (TD) β- and α-thalassemia (aged 10-25 years) to receive oral VitE 400 IU/day or placebo at a 1:1 ratio for 6 months. Cellular oxidative damage markers, including phosphatidyl serine (PS)-bearing RBCs, PS-bearing RBC vesicles, PS-bearing platelets, PS-bearing microparticles (MPs), PS-bearing RBC-MPs, PS-bearing platelet MPs (PMPs) and platelet activation, were measured before and after the intervention as the primary outcomes. Seventy-four TD thalassemia patients were categorized into 63 β-thalassemia (10 splenectomy, β-Thal-S; and 53 non-splenectomy, β-Thal-NS) and 11 α-thalassemia (non-splenectomy, α-Thal-NS). Randomized from all patient groups, 36 received VitE and 38 received a placebo. A significant reduction in PS-bearing RBCs and PS-bearing RBC vesicles was observed in the β-Thal-NS receiving VitE. This occurred parallel with a substantial decrease in malondialdehyde levels, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, found only in the β-Thal-NS but not in β-Thal-S and α-Thal-NS groups. In the β-Thal-NS group, VitE had improved RBC pathology as demonstrated by the inverse correlation between post-treatment VitE levels and PS-bearing RBCs (p = 0.001) as well as reticulocyte count (p = 0.006), although Hb levels remained unchanged. The VitE treatment did not result in improving platelet pathology or reducing MPs. No adverse event was reported in both VitE and placebo groups. VitE 400 IU/day was well-tolerated and associated with improved oxidative damage of the RBCs in TD β-Thal-NS patients. Accordingly, advice for VitE supplementation in young TD β-Thal-NS patients can be beneficial."

A sample of 3 µL whole blood was diluted 200-fold with distilled water, mixed with sinapic acid, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The efficacy of the method for the screening of β-thalassemia carriers was assessed using the β-thalassemia gene results as the standard. β-thalassemia gene results showed 109 β-thalassemia carriers and 110 normal individuals out of 219 samples. We developed a δ-globin peak slope index that can simply and effectively distinguish β-thalassemia carriers from healthy individuals, the best cutoff value for the slope index was -0.819. MALDI-TOF MS has the potential to be a valuable tool for β-thalassemia carriers screening."

Due to the unique morphological and biochemical characteristics of neonatal erythrocytes, accurate diagnosis is often challenging but critical for effective management. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the diagnosis of neonatal RBC disorders, highlighting the integration of traditional morphological analysis with advanced biochemical and molecular techniques. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine diagnostic approaches to neonatal enzymopathies, membrane disorders, and hemoglobinopathies. The roles of peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis, enzyme activity assays, and genetic testing-including next-generation sequencing (NGS)-were evaluated in the context of current clinical practice. Peripheral blood smear examination remains a foundational tool for identifying characteristic RBC morphologies. Enzymatic deficiencies such as G6PD and pyruvate kinase deficiency, membrane disorders including hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, and hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemias and sickle cell disease require integrated diagnostic strategies. Advances in molecular diagnostics have enhanced diagnostic precision and expanded the ability to perform early, genotype-driven interventions. A multidisciplinary diagnostic approach that combines morphology, biochemistry, and genetics is essential for the accurate identification and management of neonatal RBC disorders. Bridging traditional microscopy with modern genomic tools offers the potential for earlier diagnosis, personalized treatment, and improved clinical outcomes in neonatal hematology."

    "abstract": "Extramedullary haematopoiesis is a very rare non-oncologic entity, occurring in multiple blood disorders. It refers to haematopoiesis occurring outside the bone marrow. Here we report a patient with an extramedullary haematopoiesis lung mass managed by radiation therapy delivering 20Gy in ten fractions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case managed with this scheme. A 54-year-old man was referred for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. A computed tomography scan (CT-scan) had demonstrated 16 years ago bilateral pulmonary masses. The patient was diagnosed with extramedullary haematopoiesis based on concordant haematological history and typical paravertebral masses. The patient had a previous history of clear cell carcinoma of the right kidney, managed by surgery 5 years ago (pT1aN0M0 on histologic examination). The acute hypercapnic respiratory failure was suggested to be secondary to his pulmonary extramedullary haematopoiesis lesions. After multidisciplinary board discussion, radiation therapy was decided to treat the right extramedullary haematopoiesis lung mass, delivering 20Gy in ten fractions. At 3 months, the patient experienced excellent tolerance with a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms. Tramadol and non-invasive ventilation could be stopped. CT-imaging at 6 months was consistent with partial response and decrease in arteriovenous circulation within the right mass. At 12-months follow-up, patient presented with no thoracic symptoms. Pulmonary extramedullary haematopoiesis is a very rare entity. Its diagnosis should not be underestimated. Radiation therapy delivering 20Gy in ten fractions is a reasonable and safe therapeutic option."

    "abstract": "Compound heterozygous β-thalassemia and Hb E, a prevalent and severe form of thalassemia in Southeast Asia, manifests in two major clinical forms: transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). This study investigates the association of genetic polymorphisms rs5006884 in OR51B6, rs4499252 in AHSP, rs9399137 in HBS1L-MYB, and rs4671393 in BCL11A with clinical severity and transfusion dependency in β-thalassemia/Hb E patients in Thailand. A total of 189 samples, including 58 TDT, 58 NTDT, 33 homozygous Hb E, and 40 wild-type individuals, were analyzed. Genotyping of the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted using the rhAmp SNP Genotyping assay. Multivariate regression models were developed to evaluate the combined effects of genetic and clinical factors on transfusion dependency. The results showed that OR51B6 SNP rs5006884 TT genotype was significantly more frequent in the NTDT group (P < 0.05), suggesting a strong association with reduced transfusion dependency. Conversely, the AHSP SNP rs4499252 GG genotype was significantly less frequent in the homozygous Hb E group (P < 0.05) compared to other groups. Multivariate analyses highlighted hemoglobin (Hb) levels as a robust predictor of transfusion dependency, with specific HBB mutations including HBB:c.59 A > G, HBB:c.-78 A > G, HBB:c.316-197 C > T, and NC_000011.10:g.5224302_5227791del being significantly associated with NTDT (P < 0.05). Furthermore, rs5006884 in OR51B6 also played a significant role in NTDT in multivariate analyses. In contrast, SNPs in BCL11A (rs4671393), HBS1L-MYB (rs9399137), and AHSP (rs4499252) showed no significant independent associations with transfusion dependency or disease severity in this cohort. This study explores rs5006884 in OR51B6 and rs4499252 in AHSP in TDT and NTDT patients for the first time. These findings elucidate the interplay of genetic and clinical factors influencing β-thalassemia severity, paving the way for personalized management strategies to mitigate transfusion requirements."

    "abstract": "Formulas based on red blood cell indices have been used to differentiate between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia (Thal). However, they exhibit varying efficiencies. In this study, we aimed to develop a tool for discriminating between IDA and Thal by using the random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) algorithms. Complete blood count data from 1143 patients with anemia and low mean corpuscular volume were collected (382 patients with IDA, 635 with Thal, and 126 with IDA and Thal). The data were randomly divided into the training and testing datasets in a ratio of 80:20. The RF and GB models had good diagnostic performances for predicting IDA and Thal in the training and testing datasets. In the testing dataset for predicting binary outcomes, GB and RF both had an accuracy of 90.7%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.953. A lower diagnostic performance was observed when patients with IDA and Thal were included. GB and RF showed accuracies of 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively, and AUC-ROC values of 0.910 and 0.899, respectively. In conclusion, we developed a machine learning approach using GB algorithm. This tool is potentially useful in Thal- and IDA-endemic regions."

This study aimed to investigate HbD syndrome, identify unknown variants, and examine the clinicohematological and molecular profiles of hemoglobinopathies in Sindh, Pakistan. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2021 to January 2023 at Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, Pakistan. Blood samples were collected from across Sindh, Pakistan and analyzed for hemoglobinopathies using hematological tests (CBC, peripheral blood smear), cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (CE-HPLC) and molecular analysis to confirm HbD and identify rare variants. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 27. Out of 4783 chromatograms analyzed, 1563 (32.7%) were diagnosed with hemoglobinopathies. The most common conditions included β-thalassemia (81.4%), hemoglobin (Hb) variants (11.2%), and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (7.4%). HbD was found in 2.1% of cases, with HbD syndromes being the most prevalent among Hb variants (56.6%). Sickle cell disorders followed with a frequency of 32%, and HbQ, HbE, and HbC were less common. Molecular analysis confirmed the HbD Punjab variant and identified an additional four mutations, i.e., one rare β-thalassemia mutation and three Hb variants including Hb Hinsdale, Hb Renert and Hb Takasago. Hb D Punjab is the most prevalent hemoglobin variant in Sindh, Pakistan, followed by HbS and HbQ. Molecular analysis is essential for accurate diagnosis and identifying rare variants. Integrating HbD detection into screening programmes and genetic counselling can help prevent hemoglobinopathies. (S1 Abstract Graphic)."

    "abstract": "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) levels are emerging as a candidate biomarker of aging. The present study aimed to: (1) characterize the association of GDF-15 with the continuum of arterial stiffening, assessed as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, as age increases; (2) determine the predictive role of serum GDF-15 levels on mortality; and (3) identify genetic determinants of serum GDF-15 levels. Serum levels of GDF-15 and established cardiovascular risk factors, including pulse wave velocity, were assessed in a large (4736 individual) Sardinian population. Serum levels of GDF-15, which can be reliably measured repeatedly over time, increase with age; are associated with a stiffer aorta; \"mediate\" a large proportion of the age-associated increase in arterial stiffness; pose risks because of their association with greater mortality; and are significantly associated with the variant rs11549407, which causes thalassemia major in homozygosity. Because of its consistent ability to predict functional and clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, we conclude that GDF-15 serum levels serve as a robust biomarker for the continuum from health to the emergence of clinical disease during aging and, subsequently, to the likelihood of mortality."

    "abstract": "SuoquanYishen formula (SQYSF), a traditional Chinese herbal prescription for treating diabetic kidney disease (DKD), has demonstrated clinical efficacy in lowering blood glucose and alleviating renal damage. Emerging evidence implicates cellular senescence as a critical contributor to DKD progression. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SQYSF improves renal cellular senescence using both <i>in vivo</i> (db/db mice) and <i>in vitro</i> (high glucose-induced HK-2 cells) DKD models, with interventions involving SQYSF aqueous extract and SQYSF-containing serum. We screened 59 chemical compounds by UHPLC-QTOF-MS and used network pharmacology approach to discover that autophagy and cellular senescence are important pathways for pharmacological treatment of disease. Experimental validation demonstrated that senescence and damage occurred in the kidneys of db/db mice and HK-2 cells under high glucose environment, and SQYSF ameliorated these abnormal changes. Then, we also found that SQYSF enhanced autophagy in renal tissues and cells, whereas co-treatment with the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 abolished SQYSF's anti-senescence effects. Notably, DKD progression was associated with elevated Rubicon expression at mRNA and protein levels, accompanied by increased m6A modification. While SQYSF effectively downregulated Rubicon mRNA and protein expression, it did not influence m6A modification levels. Further investigation identified that SQYSF was able to target to reduce YTHDF1 expression level. Overexpression of YTHDF1 in HK-2 cells increased Rubicon mRNA stability and protein expression, while concurrently reversing SQYSF-induced autophagy enhancement and senescence amelioration. These results suggest that SQYSF exerts its role in ameliorating renal cellular senescence in DKD by targeting to reduce the expression level of YTHDF1, which inhibits the level of Rubicon mRNA and protein translation, and thus promotes autophagy. Our results reveal the active components and mechanisms of SQYSF for the treatment of DKD, which may provide useful information to guide the clinical application of SQYSF as well as the therapeutic pathway for DKD."

    "title": "Spectrum of Ophthalmic Manifestations in Patients With Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by impaired hemoglobin production, necessitating regular blood transfusions to manage anemia and associated complications. This condition also poses a significant risk for a range of ophthalmic manifestations due to factors such as iron overload from repeated transfusions, organ dysfunctions, and metabolic imbalances. This research aimed to evaluate the prevalence of ophthalmic anomalies in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and to ascertain their correlation with serum ferritin levels, hemoglobin concentrations, and the length of chelation therapy. This cross-sectional study was carried out at a tertiary care center in Central India in the pediatric and ophthalmology departments. All patients diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major between the ages of one and 15 were included in the study. Written informed consent was taken from the parents of participants. Patients with congenital ocular abnormalities, patients with a history of ocular trauma and surgery, and patients with hemoglobin diseases other than beta-thalassemia major were excluded. Complete medical history, including the disease's onset and course, blood transfusion frequency, splenectomy (performed or not), iron-chelating agents (nature, amount, time, and adherence to the regimen), positive consanguinity, and related conditions in the family, was recorded from the parents of every child. The ocular examination consisted of refraction, visual acuity, fundoscopy, slit-lamp examination, tonometry, perimetry in glaucoma suspects, tear break-up time (TBUT) test, and color vision testing. The data were analysed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, version 19; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY) software. Mean (±standard deviation) age of study participants was 8.10±3.83 years (age range: 1.5-14 years). Males comprised a smaller proportion of study participants than females, at 44% and 56%, respectively. We found one or more ocular manifestations in 38 (76%) of the patients, whereas the remaining 12 (24%) had none. Among all the ophthalmic manifestations, refractive errors were found in 56% of patients, followed by vascular tortuosity (32%). In this study, black pigmentation near the optic disc was found in 12% (6) of the patients, 4% had optic disc edema, and 4% had a high cup disc ratio. Yellowish pigmentation of the conjunctiva was seen in 8% of the patients, and 4% had dry eyes with TBUT shorter than 10 seconds. Ophthalmic manifestations such as refractive errors, vascular tortuosity, pigmentation near the optic disc, and disc edema are common findings in thalassemia patients. This comprehensive study highlights the importance of regular ophthalmic evaluations in TDT patients, emphasizing the need for an interdisciplinary approach that includes hematologists and ophthalmologists. Early detection and management of ophthalmic complications can significantly enhance a patient's quality of life and preserve vision. Future research should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of these ocular manifestations and developing targeted interventions to mitigate their impact."

    "abstract": "β-Thalassemia is defined by a reduced or complete absence of β-globin chain synthesis in hemoglobin, leading to hemolytic anemia. Heterozygous β-thalassemia, also known as β-thalassemia trait (hBTh), the mildest form of this anemia, typically does not cause symptoms in carriers. However, it may lead to changes in the immune system, including an increase in total leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts. This study aimed to evaluate various immune and inflammation markers, including neutrophil/lymphocyte, derived neutrophil/lymphocyte, lymphocyte/monocyte, platelet/lymphocyte, neutrophil/platelet ratios, systemic immune-inflammation index, systemic inflammation response index, neutrophil/natural killer cell ratio (NNKR), and inflammatory cytokines in β-thalassemia trait carriers. A retrospective observational study was conducted, including 50 β-thalassemia trait individuals and 100 healthy controls. Leukocyte, neutrophil and reticulocyte counts, and interleukin 6 levels were higher in carriers compared to controls. Notably, the β-thalassemia trait group had increased neutrophil/platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte and derived neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios, and the systemic immune-inflammation and systemic inflammation response indexes were higher compared to the controls. β-thalassemia trait shows a more pronounced inflammatory profile as indicated by hematological ratios. These ratios, therefore are potentially cost-effective and easily applicable markers for monitoring patients with the β-thalassemia trait."

    "abstract": "Despite the government's concerted efforts in implementing the National Thalassaemia Prevention and Control Program since 2004, public awareness and attitudes towards participation in screening remain unsatisfactory. This study explored the experiences and insights of carriers from an indigenous community in Sabah, Malaysia, which has the highest carrier rates in the country. Understanding the perspectives of these carriers on the thalassaemia screening program and its impact is essential for ensuring its success. Participants who are thalassaemia carriers were purposively recruited for in-depth interviews at a hospital's thalassaemia day-care centre and at a public health clinic in Kota Belud, Sabah. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. A total of 26 thalassaemia carriers were interviewed. Four main themes emerged from this study: 1) \"I don't really understand the meaning of being a carrier!\" 2) How does knowing thalassaemia diagnosis of family members influence the decision to undergo screening? 3) Impact of carrier status on relationships, emotional well-being and reproductive decisions; and 4) The importance of being a carrier should not be overlooked. To enhance future efforts supporting the current thalassaemia screening strategy, recommendations include improving understanding of what it means to be a carrier, correcting misconceptions, and importantly, revisiting and strengthening the cascade or family screening strategy at the community level. It is essential to address the implications of being a carrier appropriately in clinical care, as they should not be underestimated. Additionally, community partnerships can help raise awareness among the indigenous rural population."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of recessive diseases caused by the β<sup>S</sup> sickling mutation of <i>HBB</i> in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity with other pathogenic <i>HBB</i> mutations. Patients with severe SCD typically experience painful vaso-occlusive crises and other pain-related phenomena, including acute chest syndrome, priapism, dactylitis, avascular necrosis, and splenic sequestration and infarction. High variability of pain-related phenomena per SCD genotype indicates genetic disease modifiers (GDMs) as pathology determinants and, thus, as critical to prognosis, treatment choice, and therapy development. Articles likely holding genetic information for SCD pain phenomena were identified in PubMed and SCOPUS for article quality assessment and extraction of corresponding GDMs and observations indicative of development areas in our understanding of SCD GDMs. This process led to the initial selection of 183 articles matching the search terms, which, after two-step selection, resulted in the inclusion of 100 articles for content analysis and of significant findings for GDMs from 37 articles. Published data point to gender effects and to 51 GDM SNVs, deletions, and regions, including globin genes and significant overrepresentation of gene ontology pathways related, e.g., to oxidative stress, hypoxia, and regulation of blood pressure. Analyzed articles further pointed to additional candidate GDMs affecting SCD VOC and pain phenomena and to potential confounding factors for GWAS analyses. We found that despite the critical importance of VOC and pain phenomena for SCD pathology, corresponding clinically relevant genetic insights are held back by a shortage of large-scale, systematic multi-ethnic efforts, as undertaken by the INHERENT Network."

    "abstract": "Despite Bangladesh being one of the major hotspots of thalassemia in the world, this preventable inherited blood disorder is neglected in research and policy level. Mothers are the primary caregivers of children in South Asian countries with limited resources. Caring for a child with thalassemia can be an emotionally challenging experience for mothers in low and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. This study aimed to explore the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress of the mothers of thalassemic patients in Bangladesh and to correlate with sociodemographic and thalassemia-related factors. This cross-sectional study, conducted with 156 mothers of children with thalassemia, was a continuation of a previous investigation conducted at Bangladesh Thalassaemia Samity Hospital (BTSH) regarding the parental perspective of thalassemia in Bangladesh. A validated Bengali version of the DASS-21 questionnaire was employed to assess the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of mothers with thalassemic children. Descriptive statistics were used to examine sociodemographic characteristics, thalassemia concerns in the family, effects on social and professional life, and DASS-21 scores. The depression, anxiety, and stress levels were predicted using a multiple-regression model. We found that most mothers of thalassemia children experienced stress (~ 62%), anxiety (~ 58%), or depression (~ 63%) to some extent. Mental health concerns were significantly associated with education level (p < 0.01 for depression and stress and p < 0.05 for anxiety), spouse's education level (p < 0.01 for depression, anxiety and stress), monthly family income (p < 0.01 for depression and stress and p < 0.05 for anxiety), mortality from thalassemia in the extended family (p < 0.01 for depression and p < 0.05 for anxiety and stress), years of suffering (p < 0.10 for depression and anxiety), frequency of transfusions (p < 0.10 for depression and p < 0.05 for anxiety), social life (p < 0.01 for depression, anxiety and stress), and worry about the child's future (p < 0.05 for depression and p < 0.01 for stress). Depression and anxiety were significantly influenced by the frequency of transfusions as well as monthly cost of treatment. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the likelihood of lower level of depression among mothers was associated with higher family income (95% CI [-0.48, -4.67]) and children who had more than a 30-day gap between two transfusions. On the other hand, the likelihood of a higher level of depression was associated with a higher monthly treatment cost (95% CI [-0.48, -4.67], p = 0.037). Mothers of thalassemic patients in Bangladesh experience complex mental health challenges, including stress, anxiety, and depression. The chronic nature of the condition, combined with associated financial, social, and physical burdens, can lead to heightened levels of these mental health issues. This study provides insights for social organizations and policymakers to adopt a holistic approach in improving the overall mental well-being of mothers with thalassemic children in Bangladesh."

    "abstract": "Iron toxicity is a major contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Currently used iron chelators are not recommended during pregnancy, as they can cross the placenta causing potential risk to the fetus. However, ceasing medication may adversely affect the mother's health in both the short- and long-term. We previously demonstrated that melanin nanoparticles can effectively chelate iron, and this has been confirmed by others in iron-overloaded mice. This study aims to assess whether these nanoparticles cross the placenta and evaluate their biocompatibility and haemocompatibility. A library of 50 nm, 200 nm, and 500 nm melanin nanoparticles were synthesized and coated with Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) to improve their stability. The particles were tested for chelating iron efficacy in and biocompatibility. An in vitro BeWo (choriocarcinoma) cell model and ex vivo human placental perfusion system were used to assess nanoparticle transplacental passage. Melanin nanoparticles of all sizes were able to chelate iron with a maximum adsorption of 14 mm iron/g of material; significantly higher than Desferrioxamine (DFO) of the same concentration. It was also determined that PEGylated melanin nanoparticles with appropriate size (cut off 200 nm) could be restricted from passing across the placental barrier in an in vitro model using a human choriocarcinoma cell line and in an ex vivo human placental perfusion model. The particles did not cause red cell haemolysis or blood clotting at concentrations up to 1 mM. It was demonstrated herein that transport of MNPs across the placental barrier is highly dependent on particle size (cut off size of 200 nm PEGylated MNPs). Findings suggest the possibility of providing a safe method of iron chelation during pregnancy. Future work using in vivo models will be applied to study systemic particle interactions."

    "title": "The diagnostic and prediction performance of MR diffusion kurtosis imaging in the glioma molecular classification: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Although diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), particularly diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), has demonstrated efficacy in distinguishing between low- and high-grade gliomas, its predictive utility across various molecular genotypes remains unclear. Evaluating the accuracy of DKI and identifying sources of heterogeneity in its predictive performance could advance noninvasive molecular diagnostic methods and support the development of personalized treatment strategies. A literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Medline databases was performed. The studies retrieved were screened by two researchers (HFZ and ZGH), and those fulfilling the inclusion criteria were subsequently included in the meta-analysis. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. The analyses summarized the mean differences in mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) in patients harboring various genotypes using suitable models, and explored heterogeneity. Finally, a bivariate restricted maximum likelihood estimation method and meta-regression analysis were performed to assess diagnostic potential and stability. Fourteen studies comprising 886 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Regarding MK and MD, the mean difference between isocitrate dehydrogenase (<i>IDH</i>) mutation and <i>IDH</i> wild type was -0.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to -0.15; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 93%) and 0.22 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.33; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 92%), respectively. This heterogeneity could be explained by imaging parameters such as repetition time, echo time, maximal <i>b</i>-value, and number of diffusion directions. However, the mean difference did not reflect the genetic status of 1p/19q, <i>α</i>-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome-X-linked (<i>ATRX</i>) gene, or O<sub>6</sub>-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (<i>MGMT</i>). Analysis of diagnostic accuracy revealed that the pooled areas under the curve for MK and MD, based on <i>IDH</i> status, were 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.81), respectively. Heterogeneity was not observed for these DKI parameters. MK and MD exhibited potential diagnostic utility in the prediction of glioma molecular status and should be explored in medical practice. These parameters should be compared with other MRI models to develop a stable and suitable genetic molecular prediction method for patients with gliomas. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024568923, CRD42024568923."

    "abstract": "To explore the clinical phenotype and genetic etiology of a neonate with X-linked alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome (ATR-X) caused by ATRX gene variant, and review related literature on children with ATR-X caused by ATRX gene variants. A case of ATR-X neonate who was transferred to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University on February 11, 2022 for poor effect of treatment in the neonatology department of the hospital where he was born for 4 days due to \"postnatal slow response, groaning, and cyanosis of the skin for 30 min\" was selected as the study subject. 3 mL of peripheral blood was collected from the child and their parents, and genomic DNA was extracted for whole exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing was used to verify the pathogenic gene variations in the child's family. The pathogenicity of genetic variant sites was assessed based on the Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants by American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The amino acid sequence conservation analysis of relevant variant proteins was conducted by the Universal Protein Resource Database (UniProt) and visual analysis of these variant proteins was performed by Swiss online protein three-dimensional modeling database (SWISS-MODEL). Using keywords such as \"ATRX gene\" and \" X-linked alpha-thalassemia mental retardation syndrome\" both in Chinese and English, relevant literature on ATR-X children caused by ATRX gene variants was retrieved from the CNKI, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and PubMed databases, and the clinical phenotypes of ATR-X patients reported in the retrieved literature were analyzed. The literature retrieval time was set from the establishment of each database to December 31st, 2023. This study followed the research procedures approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Ethics No. 2023-KY-1360-002), and informed consent of clinical study was signed by the guardian of the child. The child in this study presented with symptoms such as delayed response, feeding difficulties accompanied by vomiting, low body temperature, hypotonia in all extremities, apnea, abnormal hearing screening, and a Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA) score of 19 (lower than the normal range).Hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis suggested the presence of α-thalassemia. The results of WES and Sanger sequencing revealed a hemizygous missense variant c.668G>A (p.C223Y) in exon 9 of the ATRX gene in the child of the study, neither of the parents of the child carried this variant, indicating that it is a de novo variant. Based on the Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants released by ACMG, this gene variant was assessed as pathogenic (PS2+PM2_Supporting+PP3_Strong+PP4_Strong). The results of amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the pathogenic variant site normally encodes cysteine, which is highly conserved among various animal species. This pathogenic variant can lead to alterations in the hydrogen bonding structure of ATRX protein, thereby affecting its structural stability. Based on the clinical manifestations and genetic testing results of the child in this study, a diagnosis of ATR-X syndrome was established Based on the literature retrieval strategy established in this study, 13 relevant articles concerning ATR-X syndrome in children caused by ATRX gene variants were retrieved, including 5 Chinese articles and 8 English articles, involving a total of 311 ATR-X children. Including the child in this study, the total number of ATR-X children reaches 312. All 312 children were male and presented with mental retardation. Among them, 45.8% (143/312) had coexisting α-thalassemia, 45.2% (141/312) had abnormal genital appearance, 44.2% (138/312) had facial malformations, and 30.8% (96/312) had hypotonia. Other phenotypes included microcephaly, skeletal dysplasia, among others. The ATR-X child in this study exhibit a range of clinical phenotypes, including delayed growth and development, facial malformation, abnormal genital appearance, apnea, vomiting symptoms, among others. The de novo variant of ATRX gene c.668G>A (p.C223Y) was identified as the genetic etiology. This study contributes to the expansion of the clinical phenotype spectrum and genetic variation spectrum of ATR-X children."

    "abstract": "To analyze the hematological characteristics of patients with three common deletional β-thalassemia and concomitant α-thalassemia in Huizhou, Guangdong province. A total of 1 335 subjects of childbearing age with hemoglobin F (Hb F) ≥ 5% at the Huizhou First Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital between June 2014 and December 2023 were enrolled as our study cohort. The hematological parameters were determined by blood cell counters and automatic capillary electrophoresis, while liquid phase chip and gap-PCR were employed for the detection of routine thalassemias and the three common deletional β-thalassemia, respectively. The hematological characteristics of patients with the deletional β-thalassemia were analyzed. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Huizhou First Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital [Ethics No. 20231107(B2)]. A total of 384 cases of the three common deletional β-thalassemia were identified, including 184 cases of Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup>, 191 cases of Southeast Asian hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (SEA-HPFH), and nine cases of Chinese Taiwanese, for a total detection rate of 28.76%. Patients who did not meet the established criteria were excluded from the study, leaving 372 cases. All of which presented with hypochromic microcytic anemia and significantly elevated Hb F. Except for normal or decreasing of Hb A2 levels in patients with Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup>, the levels of Hb A2 in patients with the other two deletional β-thalassemia were increased with different degrees. Differential comparison results showed that significant differences were observed in Hb A2 and Hb F values among the groups of the three common deletional β-thalassemia heterozygotes (P < 0.05). According to the type of gene variation, 180 patients with Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup> heterozygotes were divided into three groups, including αα/αα, Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (149), -α/αα, Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (14), and --/αα, Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (17). Similarly, 179 patients with SEA-HPFH heterozygotes were divided into three groups, including αα/αα, SEA-HPFH/β<sup>N</sup> (150), -α/αα, SEA-HPFH/β<sup>N</sup> (12), and --/αα, SEA-HPFH/β<sup>N</sup> (17). Differential comparison results showed that the Hb F levels of the Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup> combined with α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia group were significantly lower than those of the Chinese Gγ<sup>+</sup>(Aγδβ)<sup>0</sup> combined with α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia group and the control group (P < 0.05). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and Hb F values of the SEA-HPFH combined with α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia group were significantly lower than those of the SEA-HPFH combined with α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia group and the control group (P < 0.05). The above research results can not only enhance the ability of clinicians to identify deletional β-thalassemia and concomitant α-thal, improve the level of genetic counseling, but also provide data support for the development of deletional β-thalassemia prevention and control programme and the development of prenatal and postnatal care."

    "abstract": "Compound heterozygous hemoglobin Q-Thailand (Hb QT) and hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) are rare hemoglobinopathies found occasionally in Southeast Asia. This condition is associated with varying degrees of anemia. This report aims to describe the prenatal diagnosis, natural course, and intrauterine treatment of Hb QT/CS disease, which is thought to be more severe during fetal development than to later in life. A 23-year-old pregnant woman who was at risk of fetal Hb E/β-thalassemia underwent a prenatal ultrasound examination and cordocentesis at 21 weeks of gestation. The ultrasound revealed signs of fetal anemia, including mild cardiomegaly and normal peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA-PSV). Fetal hemoglobin analysis revealed a diagnosis of Hb QT/CS disease, which was confirmed by molecular study. A follow-up ultrasound at 23 weeks showed progressive cardiac enlargement, increased anemia, increased MCA-PSV, and mild hydropic changes. An intrauterine blood transfusion (IUT) was administered. Subsequent ultrasounds demonstrated a complete resolution of the hydropic signs. The fetus required only one IUT, and the anemia improved spontaneously later in the pregnancy. The woman delivered a healthy male newborn vaginally at 39 weeks of gestation. Hb QT/CS disease can lead to fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis. However, the severity of anemia in this case improves as the pregnancy progresses toward term. If the fetus survives the critical period in utero without significant organ damage from anemia, a favorable long-term prognosis is possible. This report is the first to describe the prenatal diagnosis, natural course, and intrauterine treatment of Hb QT/CS disease with a successful outcome."

    "abstract": "Hereditary diseases, particularly genetic blood disorders such as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and Thalassemia, pose significant public health challenges. Premarital carrier screening (PMCS) is a critical preventive measure, yet its uptake remains low in many regions, including the Ahafo Region of Ghana. This study assessed young adults' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding PMCS for SCD, G6PD deficency, and Thalassemia and determined factors associated with these KAP outcomes in the Ahafo Region. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2024, involving 460 young adults aged 18-35 years attending various health facilities in the Ahafo Region. Data were collected using a validated structured questionnaire, translated into the local dialect for clarity. The questionnaire covered socio-demographic information, knowledge of PMCS, attitudes towards PMCS, and PMCS practices. Data were analysed using Stata version 14, with descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests for associations, and logistic regression to identify significant predictors of KAP. The study population was predominantly female (85.7%), with a mean age of 24.7 years. Only 15.4% (n = 71) of respondents demonstrated good knowledge of PMCS. Key factors influencing knowledge included female gender, age 26-35 years, tertiary education, and receiving information from healthcare services. Positive attitudes towards PMCS were observed in 66.7% of respondents, significantly associated with tertiary education, self-employment, unemployment, and cohabiting marital status. However, only 14.1% exhibited positive PMCS practices, with significant predictors being tertiary education and being married. These findings indicate a substantial gap between awareness and actual practice of PMCS. This study underscores the urgent need for targeted educational interventions and policy measures to enhance PMCS uptake among young adults in the Ahafo Region. Improving healthcare communication, integrating PMCS education into tertiary curricula, addressing sociocultural barriers, and enacting supportive policies are essential steps. Engaging various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, educational institutions, community leaders, policymakers, and NGOs, is crucial for effectively translating positive attitudes into proactive practices and reducing the prevalence of genetic blood disorders in the Ahafo Region and Ghana as a whole."

    "abstract": "Gene expression during cell development and differentiation is orchestrated by distal regulatory elements that precisely modulate cell selective gene activity. Gene therapy vectors leverage these elements for precise spatiotemporal transgene expression. Here, we develop a one-shot approach to screen candidate regulatory sequences from large-scale epigenomics data for programmable transgene expression within gene therapy viral vectors. We assess a library of 15,000 short sequences derived from developmentally active elements during erythropoiesis using a clinically relevant reporter vector. These elements display a gradient of transcriptional enhancer activity in erythroid cells, with high cell type restriction and developmental stage specificity. Finally, replacing the canonical β-globin μLCR with a compact enhancer in a β-thalassemia lentiviral vector successfully corrects the thalassemic phenotype in patient-derived hematopoietic and stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), while increasing viral titers and cell transducibility. Our approach provides further insights into enhancer biology with wider implications for human gene therapy."

Oncocytic NETs (O-NETs) have been shown to be more clinically aggressive. Whether O-NETs are more akin to C-NETs or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNECs) is not established. Clinicopathologic characteristics and immunohistochemical expression of death domain-associated protein (DAXX), α-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked genes (ATRX), retinoblastoma 1, p53, and SMAD4 in 30 O-NETs (25 pancreatic and 4 from luminal gastrointestinal tract) was compared to 32 C-NETs (23 pancreatic and 8 from luminal gastrointestinal tract). Whole exome sequencing was performed in a subset of each cohort. O-NETs were male-predominant (65.6%) and had higher mean Ki-67 index (7.4% versus 2.9% in C-NETs) (P = 0.03), corresponding to more grade 2 or above (53.3%) tumors. O-NET patients had more advanced disease (pT3/pT4, 75% versus 36.8%) (P = 0.024), distant metastasis (50% versus 25%) (P = 0.042), progression (increased size/recurrence/new metastases) (n = 8 versus 3; P = 0.1), and death (n = 3 versus 1; P = 0.32). Forty percent of O-NETs (versus 12.5% of C-NETs; P = 0.041) showed DAXX/ATRX loss, with one showing coexisting retinoblastoma 1 and SMAD4 loss. P53 staining pattern was wild type in all cases. Whole exome sequencing of 10 cases showed DAXX, ATRX, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 alterations in O-NETs and C-NETs, and coexisting DNMT3A and MTOR alterations in one O-NET. O-NET subtype is associated with advanced disease and unfavorable outcomes compared to C-NETs. O-NETs are cytologically distinct, male-predominant tumors that often present with higher grade and advanced disease. Their aggressive behavior is possibly related to frequent DAXX/ATRX loss and less likely PDNEC-related molecular alterations. Pathologists should be mindful of this aggressive morphologic subtype and clearly convey its presence in pathology reports."

A retrospective observational study of prenatally diagnosed NIHF at a tertiary referral center in India over 10 years from 2014 to 2023 using the data retrieved from case files, ultrasound and investigation reports. Included 184 NIHF events in 166 patients with an estimated prevalence of 0.11% (184/160,156 deliveries). 42.5% of women were primigravida and 30 cases were in 12 patients presenting with recurrent hydrops. Etiology could be ascertained in 76/154 (49.35%) total new cases of hydrops presenting for the first time and in 9/12 (75%) total patients with recurrent NIHF. The most common causes among first time NIHF were structural anomalies and aneuploidies, while inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) were the most common in recurrent cases. The diagnostic yield of ultrasound alone was 30.7% (51/166 patients), which improved with addition of tests to 45.78% (76/166) with cytogenetic and 53.6% (89/166) with sequencing studies. The overall survival beyond 28 days of postnatal life was 9.2% (17/184 events), with the rest ending in MTP/spontaneous abortion 47.8% (88/184), stillbirth 24.5% (45/184), early neonatal death 17.4% (32/184) and late neonatal death 1.1% (2/184). Treatable causes included fetal arrhythmias, some structural anomalies and certain IEMs amenable to early postnatal dietary intervention. Although overall survival in NIHF is poor, the aim of diagnostic workup should be to find a treatable cause. Even with limited resources, etiology can still be deduced in more than half of the cases. Management decisions can often be made based on history and ultrasonography while restricting the expensive genetic tests to unexplained or recurrent cases."

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are functional RNA molecules that do not code for proteins. Among these, circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a recently identified class of endogenous ncRNAs with a pivotal role in gene regulation, alongside short ncRNAs (e.g., microRNAs or miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). CircRNAs are characterized by their single-stranded, covalently closed circular structure, which lacks polyadenylated tails and 5'-3' ends. This unique circular conformation makes them resistant to exonuclease degradation, rendering them more stable than linear RNAs, such as mRNAs in human blood cells, which highlights their potential as biomarkers. Both linear and circular RNAs are derived from pre-mRNA precursors. However, while linear RNAs are produced through conventional splicing, circRNAs are primarily formed through a process known as reverse splicing. CircRNAs can be categorized into five basic types: exon circRNAs, circular intronic RNAs, exon-intron circRNAs, intergenic circRNAs, and fusion circRNAs. These molecules have been shown to significantly influence key hallmarks of cancer, including sustained growth signaling, proliferation, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis, unlimited replicative potential, and metastasis. This article will delve into the biogenesis and functions of circRNAs, explore their roles in cancer, and discuss their potential applications as therapeutic options and diagnostic biomarkers."

Recent insights into the molecular underpinnings of AML, particularly those involving genetic mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities, illuminate the complex landscape of this disease, where patient outcomes are significantly influenced by individual biological markers. Galectin-9, initially recognized for its involvement in fundamental biological processes such as cell proliferation and immune modulation, has emerged as a pivotal molecule in AML, with expression levels correlating with leukemic cell behavior and clinical prognosis. This review consolidates the extensive literature on Galectin-9, elucidating its role in leukemic transformation and the therapeutic implications of manipulating this pathway. By investigating the intricate relationship between Galectin-9 and AML, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding that could lead to innovative strategies for managing this aggressive malignancy, offering hope for improved survival outcomes through targeted therapeutic interventions."

Here, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of pre-conceptional and early pregnancy screening initiatives for severe thalassemia prevention in a diverse population of 28,043 women. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), we identify 4,226 (15.07%) thalassemia carriers across 29 ethnic groups and categorize them into high- (0.75%), low- (25.86%), and unknown-risk (69.19%) groups based on their spouses' screening results. Post-screening follow-up reveals 59 fetuses with severe thalassemia exclusively in high-risk couples, underscoring the efficacy of risk classification. Among 25,053 live births over 6 months of age, two severe thalassemia infants were born to unknown-risk couples, which was attributed to incomplete screening and late NGS-based testing for a rare variant. Notably, 64 rare variants are identified in 287 individuals, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of thalassemia. We also observe that migrant flow significantly impacts carrier rates, with 93.90% of migrants to Chenzhou originating from high-prevalence regions in southern China. Our study demonstrates that NGS-based screening during pre-conception and early pregnancy is effective for severe thalassemia prevention, emphasizing the need for continuous screening efforts in areas with high and underestimated prevalence."

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated endothelial biomarkers as indicators of cardiovascular disease risk in thalassemia. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase identified 41 studies comparing biomarkers in thalassemia patients and healthy individuals. The biomarkers analyzed included ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, von Willebrand factor (vWF), endothelial microparticles (EMPs), nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and endothelin-1 (ET-1). Using random effects modeling, pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The results showed significantly elevated levels of ICAM-1 (SMD 2.15, 95% CI: 1.09-3.22), VCAM-1 (SMD 2.50, 95% CI: 1.35-3.66), E-selectin (SMD 1.21, 95% CI: 0.92-1.50), P-selectin (SMD 1.62, 95% CI: 0.83-2.42), and ET-1 (SMD 1.23, 95% CI: 0.03-2.42) in thalassemia patients. However, NO, ADMA, and vWF showed no significant differences. No studies on NOS were identified, while only one study found significantly elevated EMPs in thalassemia patients. This review highlights ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, and ET-1 as key biomarkers for cardiovascular complications in thalassemia. Further research on EMPs and NOS is essential to enhance the understanding of endothelial dysfunction in this population."

    "abstract": "Small molecules that inhibit LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1, KDM1A) have been shown to induce abundant fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in red blood cells both in vitro and in vivo, therefore potentially serving as potent and cost-effective therapeutics to treat the β-globinopathies, sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassaemia major (TM). However, most LSD1 inhibitors (LSD1i) that induce HbF in vivo are covalent and irreversible, which leads to adverse effects. In this study, we utilized structure-aided drug design to develop potent new reversible LSD1i's leading to robust γ-globin expression in vitro. Moreover, in a mouse model of SCD, oral administration of these novel inhibitors lead to significant HbF elevation and alleviation of multiple features of disease pathology that are the usual consequences of SCD. In addition, we discovered that combined treatment of an LSD1i with a BRD4 degrader (BD-9136) represses the induction of RUNX1 and PU.1, thereby rescuing the erythroid to myeloid lineage conversion that accompanies LSD1i in hematopoiesis. The data indicate that this new generation of LSD1i can effectively induce HbF levels, reduce SCD pathologies, and are well-tolerated by oral administration in SCD mice. We anticipate that the combination of these or related binary compounds offer exciting new therapeutic possibilities for treating SCD and TM."

    "title": "Correlation of Vitamin B12 Deficiency with Sensorimotor Deficits in Postmenopausal Women: A Cross-sectional, Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Postmenopausal women often face Vitamin B12 deficiency, a condition crucial for neurological health. Sensorimotor deficits, which affect sensory and motor functions, are common in this demographic and can lead to falls, reduced mobility, and decreased quality of life. This study aims to investigate the correlation between Vitamin B12 deficiency and sensorimotor deficits in postmenopausal women. The study was conducted, focusing on postmenopausal women attending the outpatient department. This cross-sectional and observational study investigated sensorimotor deficits in 100 postmenopausal women meeting the inclusion criteria. Exclusions included histories of orthopedic surgeries, paralysis, thalassemia, diabetes, and uncontrolled hypertension. Blood samples were collected to assess Vitamin B12 levels sensorimotor assessments included pain evaluation with an algometer, crude touch, temperature sensation with a tuning fork and warm water, position sense with eyes closed, vibration sense with a tuning fork, discriminative sense tests, coordination assessments, and muscle evaluations for bulk, symmetry, tone, strength (graded by the Medical Research Council scale), and reflexes in both limbs. Eighteen percent of postmenopausal women were found to have a deficiency in Vitamin B12, while 82% did not have a deficiency. Among patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency, the sensory deficit was present in 52.9% patients and the motor deficit was present in 33.3% patients. The association between them was found to be statistically significant. Among patients with Vitamin B12 deficiency, sensory and motor deficit was present in 32% of patients. The association between them was found to be statistically significant. In this study, we conclude that the association of sensory and motor deficits with Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to be statistically significant. The prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency in postmenopausal women is 18%."

    "title": "Molecular Characterization and Clinical Outcomes of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms Harboring PAK4-NAMPT Alterations.",
    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus is US Food and Drug Administration-approved for advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNENs), yet resistance is common, necessitating the identification of resistance mechanisms for effective treatment strategies. Previous studies suggest that targeting the aberrant expression of mTOR regulators p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) sensitizes pNENs to everolimus. In this study, we queried a large real-world data set of pNENs, characterizing the molecular and immune landscapes, as well as the clinical outcomes associated with aberrant PAK4 and NAMPT expression. Two-hundred and ninety-four pNEN cases were analyzed using next-generation sequencing and whole-exome/whole-transcriptome sequencing. We stratified patients into clusters on the basis of median cutoff. High expression of genes activated in response to mTOR activation was found in NAMPT-high and PAK4-high groups. Enrichment of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and glycolysis pathways was observed in these tumors. Higher mutation rates in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, TSC2, SETD2, and CCNE1 were observed in high NAMPT and PAK4 clusters. Immune analysis revealed enrichment in inflammatory response pathways, IL2/STAT5 signaling, and immune checkpoint genes. Increased neutrophils, natural killer cells, and macrophages were found in PAK4-high/NAMPT-high tumors. Analysis of real-world patient data revealed that high PAK4 (<i>P</i> = .0428) or NAMPT (<i>P</i> = .0002) expression individually correlated with lower overall survival in all neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) cohorts, while the combined high expression of both was associated with the worst outcomes (<i>P</i> = .0002). Similar trends were observed in pancreatic NEN cohorts. Our study demonstrates that PAK4-high/NAMPT-high pNENs are associated with distinct molecular and immune profiles. Further investigation is warranted to determine if dual PAK4 and NAMPT blockade enhances the efficacy of immunotherapeutics."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia patients often exhibit low bone mineral density (BMD). The iron overload associated with thalassemia elevates oxidative stress levels, leading to reduced BMD. Melatonin improves BMD in postmenopausal osteopenia, however, its effect on BMD in thalassemia patients with iron overload has not been investigated. A randomized controlled study was conducted at Hematology Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University. Thalassemia patients with osteopenia and iron overloaded condition, as indicated by BMD Z-score <-2 at l-spine, femoral neck, or total hip, and serum ferritin level > 500 μg/L were recruited in this study. Patients were randomized to receive either melatonin 20 mg/day or placebo at bedtime for 12 months. BMD was re-evaluated 12 months after interventions. Bone turnover markers (BTM), malondialdehyde (MDA as an oxidative stress marker), and pain scores were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The outcomes, including BMD, BTM, MDA, and pain scores, were evaluated in all patients. Forty-one thalassemia patients (18 males) were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either the melatonin group (n = 21) or the placebo group (n = 20). Characteristics of patients were not differences between groups. Mean age was 30.8 ± 6.2 years old. Thirty-three patients (80.4%) were transfusion-dependent patients. At 12 months, mean BMD at l-spine in melatonin group was not significantly different from placebo group (p = 0.069). However, l-spine BMD at 12 months in the melatonin group was significantly greater than baseline (p = 0.029). Serum levels of P1NP and MDA were significantly reduced at 6 months compared to baseline following melatonin treatment. The melatonin group experienced a notable decrease in back pain scores after 12 months compared to the initial measurements. 20 mg daily melatonin supplementation for 12 months alleviated l-spine BMD loss in iron-overloaded thalassemia with low BMD. Melatonin also significantly reduced circulating oxidative stress and mitigated back pain in these patients."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin (Hb) Adana, the alpha-globin gene mutation at codon 59 (GGC → GAC), is very rare globally but occasionally encountered in Southeast Asia. Its combination with alpha0-thalassemia (-<sup>SEA</sup>) results in Hb H-Adana, which can lead to severe fetal anemia. This report describes a 22-year-old woman at 33 weeks, presenting with fetal cardiomegaly with early hydropic changes and anemia (middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity: 1.75 multiple of median [MoM]). Cordocentesis revealed a Hb level of 4.3 g/dL, and intrauterine transfusion (IUT) was performed. However, non-reassuring fetal heart rate developed after IUT and cesarean section was performed. A preterm live male infant was delivered, weighing 1455 g, and was confirmed to be Hb H-Adana. Post-natal life was transfusion-dependent. In conclusion, this case focuses on prenatal features of fetal Hb H-Adana, which caused fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis in the third trimester. In cases of unexplained fetal anemia, Hb H-Adana should be listed in the differential diagnoses, especially in areas of high prevalence."

    "abstract": "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles, which are released into the extracellular space by all types of cells, especially stem cells. Compared with stem cells, exosomes are safer and can be considered one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease. We examined the effect of exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) on a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this purpose, male Wistar rats weighing 220-250 g were used. For the induction of AD, rats received a daily dosage of 100 mg/kg Aluminum chloride (Alcl3) by oral gavage for 60 days. Also, Primary BM-MSC was extracted from the femora of Wistar rats (male, 100-150 g). Extracted exosomes were Characterized and Qualified using TEM Microscope and Zetasizer Nano. Specific markers of exosomes were evaluated by Flow cytometry. MSC-extracted exosomes (150 µg/µl) were injected 2 or 5 times into the animals via tail vein on specific days. Our data revealed that receiving exosomes significantly prevented AlCl3-induced enhancement of hippocampal APP gene expression, beta-amyloid plaque formation, impairment of passive avoidance learning and spatial memory. However, exosome injections in healthy subjects caused some negative effects such as spatial memory impairment. It seems, MSC-derived exosomes can be considered as a candidate to prevent AD progression."

    "abstract": "In India, the prevalence of beta thalassemia is 3.74%, and sixty to eighty percent of thalassemic children have vitamin D deficiency syndrome. To estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and parathyroid levels in thalassemic children of Central India. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 61 diagnosed beta thalassemic children of 2-12 years of age at the pediatric department of the tertiary care institute of Central India for six months by consecutive sampling method. Demographic, transfusion, and clinical data were collected. Serum Vitamin D levels were estimated by electrochemical-luminescence technology and serum parathyroid hormone was by immunoassay. Complete blood count, serum ferritin/calcium/phosphorous, and liver functions test were performed. Frequency, mean, standard deviation, and correlation of various variables were performed. Three-fourths of the participants were above 5 years of age and male to female ratio was 1.5:1. Most (88.5%) cases required blood transfusion every 3-4 weeks duration and 80.3% were receiving chelation therapy and all of them were on oral Deferasirox. About half of the participants had serum ferritin levels 1000-3000 ng/dl, and 27 (44.3%) had levels more than 3000- 5000 ng/dl. The total mean vitamin D and parathyroid hormone were 18.4 ± 9.9 ng/ml, and 13.1 ± 15.4 pg/ml respectively. The prevalence of low vitamin D was 63.9% and low parathyroid level in 21.3% of participants. Serum vitamin D level was inversely related to age, serum ferritin level, and transfusion frequency while directly related to serum calcium level. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is 63.9% and low parathyroid hormone is 21.3%. Serum vitamin D has a negative correlation with increased age and increased serum ferritin levels."

A retrospective analysis of 3 195 cases of thalassemia gene screened in the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022 was performed to detect 21 mutations of β-globin genes which was common in Chinese people using fluorescence PCR melting curve method. Patients with single heterozygous carrying β-thalassemia gene were divided into β<sup>+</sup> heterozygote group and β<sup>0</sup> heterozygote group, while the control group consisted of 219 healthy individuals. Four indices, including RBC, hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were collected from all β heterozygous carriers and 219 healthy people, and compared between β<sup>+</sup> heterozygote group, β<sup>0</sup> heterozygote group and control group, as well as between β<sup>+</sup> heterozygous carriers, β<sup>0</sup> heterozygous carriers and healthy population of different sexes aged 18-45 years.

    "abstract": "β-Thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by decreased or completely absent β-globin synthesis, leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is a major public health concern in Jordan, as in other Mediterranean countries. β-Thalassemia carriers are normally asymptomatic; nevertheless, laboratory examinations often reveal mild anemia characterized by microcytic hypochromic erythrocytes, with differences influenced by specific phenotypes. This study aimed to assess and correlate the variants among β<sup>0</sup> and β<sup>+</sup> phenotypes in the Jordanian population with hematological characteristics, as well as establish and determine reference values for distinguishing between the two phenotypes. One hundred forty-five β-thalassemia carriers were recruited from various governorates in Jordan. Hematological parameters, including complete blood count (CBC) and capillary electrophoresis of hemoglobin (Hb), were evaluated in all participants. Molecular techniques, specifically polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with hybridization, were employed to identify β-thalassemia variants and classify the participants as having β<sup>0</sup> and β<sup>+</sup> phenotypes. Among the 145 β-thalassemia carriers, 64 (44.14%) and 81 (55.86%) had β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia and β<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia, respectively. Participants exhibiting a cutoff value of Hb (≤ 11.0 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (≤ 64.0 fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (≤ 19.0 pg), and hemoglobin A<sub>2</sub> (Hb-A<sub>2</sub>) (≥ 5.00%) were classified as having the β<sup>0</sup> phenotype. These participants demonstrated significantly lower mean Hb, MCV, MCH, and higher mean Hb-A<sub>2</sub> than the participants with the β<sup>+</sup> phenotype (P < 0.0001). Hb, MCV, MCH, and Hb-A<sub>2</sub> can serve as effective screening tools for predicting β<sup>0</sup>- and β<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia in the Jordanian population. These findings have important clinical implications for early diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prenatal screening of β-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Dehydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis (DHS), also known as Hereditary Xerocytosis (HX), is a rare genetic disorder primarily arising from gain-of-function mutations in <i>PIEZO1</i>, which disrupt mechanosensitive ion channels on red blood cell membranes. This dysfunction leads to cellular dehydration and chronic anemia, while DHS/HX cells exhibit increased hypotonic resistance. Interpreting <i>PIEZO1</i> variants requires integrating clinical findings with specialized knowledge. Laboratory tests, whole-genome sequencing, and Sanger sequencing were conducted for clinical phenotyping and identification of disease-causing mutations within the proband and his parents. The proband was found to have both β-thalassemia trait and Dehydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis. The proband inherited compound heterozygous mutations in the <i>PIEZO1</i> gene (c.136G > A and c.6307C > G) from his mother and father, respectively. Additionally, the proband had a heterozygous β-globin gene mutation (c.315 + 2delT) inherited from his father. Compared to patients with either DHS/HX or β-thalassemia alone, this patient, as a β-thalassemia carrier with suspected Dehydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis, exhibited highly complex laboratory findings. Genetic testing played a crucial role in diagnosing conditions with overlapping clinical features. Given the increased risk of thromboembolic complications, splenectomy is contraindicated in DHS/HX patients, highlighting the necessity for precise diagnosis of DHS/HX and molecular confirmation of suspected hereditary red blood cell disorders."

We retrospectively analyzed 9,376 patients who underwent their first fresh ART cycle from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. Patients were classified into four groups based on relative change in E2 levels: low response group, moderate response group, moderate-high response group, and high response group. The primary outcomes were blastocyst formation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and live birth rate, while secondary outcomes included miscarriage rate and ectopic pregnancy rate. Most cycles (96.5%) demonstrated an increase in E2 levels during COS. The blastocyst formation rate significantly increased across the groups (low response group: 0.13, moderate response group: 0.21, moderate-high response group: 0.28, high response group: 0.34; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression showed significantly higher blastocyst formation rates in the moderate response group (adjusted OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.687-2.399), moderate-high response group (adjusted OR = 4.613, 95% CI: 3.853-5.523), and high response group (adjusted OR = 11.295, 95% CI: 9.192-13.880) compared to the low response group. Both clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate were significantly higher in the moderate-high response group and high response group compared to the low response group (clinical pregnancy rate: 54.5% and 61.5% vs. 35.5%, adjusted RR = 1.21 [95% CI: 1.03-1.42] and 1.27 [95% CI: 1.08-1.51]; live birth rate: 44.9% and 52.0% vs. 25.7%, adjusted RR = 1.27 [95% CI: 1.06-1.52] and 1.35 [95% CI: 1.11-1.64]).

No significant differences in miscarriage rate or ectopic pregnancy rate were observed across the groups. Higher E2 responses were associated with improved embryo development and better pregnancy outcomes."

    "title": "New formula based on the discrepancy between impedance and fluorescence platelet to distinguish iron-deficiency anemia from non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) are the 2 most common types of microcytic hypochromic anemia, but they are difficult to distinguish by routine tests. It is reported that red blood cells (RBCs) in thalassemia tend to be more microcytic and polymorphic, which may interfere with impedance platelet count (PLT-I). To correct PLT-I, fluorescence platelet count (PLT-F) can be used. To establish a new discriminant formula based on the discrepancy between PLT-I and PLT-F (dPLT), this study retrospectively reviewed 350 patients: 145 with IDA and 205 with NTDT. The RBC and platelet parameters were obtained on a Sysmex XN-9000 system. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to screen the indicators. Diagnostic efficacy was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves. We found that the interference with PLT-I by RBCs was greater in patients with NTDT. The dPLT of patients with NTDT was statistically significantly higher than that of patients with IDA. Based on erythrocyte indices and dPLT, the diagnosis model, called PRMH (a model incorporating platelet difference, RBC count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit), was established. When compared with 11 reported formulas, the PRMH model showed better diagnostic efficacy, with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 87%. Hence, the PRMH model can be used to distinguish NTDT from IDA."

    "title": "Caffeic Acid-Biogenic Amine Complexes Outperform Standard Drugs in Reducing Toxicity: Insights from <i>In Vivo</i> Iron Chelation Studies.",
    "abstract": "Iron homeostasis imbalance, caused by conditions such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, and myocardial infarction, often results in elevated free iron levels, leading to ferroptosis and severe organ damage. While current iron chelators like deferoxamine (DFO) and deferiprone are effective, they are associated with significant side effects, including nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver fibrosis. This creates an urgent need for safer, natural-product-based alternatives for effective iron chelation therapy (ICT). This study investigates caffeic acid (CA)-based complexes with biogenic amines, specifically spermine (CA-Sp) and histidine (CA-His), as potential ICT candidates. Initial <i>in vitro</i> assays on HEK-293 cells under iron dextran (ID)-induced toxicity have demonstrated their protective effects, with CA-Sp exhibiting superior efficacy. The <i>in vivo</i> studies in mice have further validated their potential, showing remarkable iron chelation and toxicity mitigation compared to DFO. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) reveals significant iron excretion in fecal matter in the treatment group along with reductions in serum ferritin levels. The markers of nephrotoxicity (creatinine) and liver function (ALT, AST) have also been shown to be normalized in treated groups, while immunological analyses have revealed restored levels of neutrophils, T cells, and B cells. Additionally, the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, have exhibited significant reductions, with the CA-based formulations surpassing the effects of DFO. Histological analyses using Prussian blue staining have further confirmed reduced iron deposition in vital organs such as the liver, kidney, and spleen. These findings highlight CA-Sp as a particularly promising candidate for ICT, offering a safer and more effective strategy for managing iron overload and its associated complications."

Subsequent to regulatory approvals, several reports have identified the risk of extra-medullary haematopoiesis, which resulted in updated safety labelling. In this report, we present a case of a patient with TDT who developed severe splenomegaly, haemolysis and thrombocytopenia necessitating treatment discontinuation."

Its application in thalassemia may have an impact on treatment option and may help predict mortality and morbidity. This case control study included a total of 62 adult patients registered as β-thalassemia major at the Jin pediatric hematology-oncology center (Duhok city) in addition to 50 age and sex matched healthy controls. The RAND Short Form 36 (SF-36) Questionnaire was used to evaluate HR-QoL score, and data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS). The HRQoL mean scores were significantly lower in adults with thalassemia major when compared to their matched controls (66.35% Vs. 84.32% with P<0.0005). Among the eight domains of Short Form-36, all except role emotional were significantly reduced as compared to their respective scores in the controls. Among the patient's group, the most affected domain was the general health, while the least affected was the social function. Lower mean HRQoL scores were seen in those with female gender which was clinically significant only in the pain domain (p=0.004). Significantly lower scores were recorded for physical function, role limitation physical, energy/fatigue and general health domains in those with heart failure. The study documented that thalassemia major had lower HRQoL compared to their healthy counterparts. Further multicenter studies are needed to assess better the predictors of lower HRQoL in this population, since it would provide important insights for improving the management of the disease and the choices of the treatment."

Activation of delta globin, the non-alpha globin of HbA2 (α2δ2), could represent a possible approach to improve the clinical severity of these pathologies. Notably, the therapeutic potential of delta globin has been demonstrated in previous studies using a mouse model of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The present study evaluated <i>delta globin</i> gene activation by small molecules in erythroid cells isolated from transgenic murine foetal liver. A screening of 119 molecules, selected for their potential in drug repurposing, was performed without prior selection based on specific pathways of interest. Three candidates-Nexturastat, Stattic and Palbociclib-were found to have high efficacy on <i>delta globin</i> expression. Palbociclib also proved effective in increasing <i>gamma globin</i> expression. All of these compounds have pharmacokinetic profiles that are beneficial for clinical application, providing potential inducer agents of HbA2 that could have therapeutic effects in the treatment of beta-hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal cells constitute the primary structural support elements within endometriotic lesions, yet their pivotal roles in endometriotic pathogenesis remain largely uncharted. This study aimed to construct a single-cell atlas of endometriosis using samples from three ovarian tissues affected by endometriosis and three normal ovarian tissues. Through the utilization of scRNA-seq, we have unveiled six distinct mesenchymal subclusters in normal and endometriosis-afflicted ovaries, elucidating the diverse functions of mesenchymal populations in endometriosis. Our comprehensive analysis has revealed that mesenchymal cells predominantly engage in three key functions: ribosome-mediated protein synthesis and processing, cell adhesion facilitating intercellular support and communication, and a range of metabolic processes. Furthermore, our findings have identified several pivotal differentially expressed genes (e.g. C3, FN1, COL3A1, COL1A1, NRXN3), primarily associated with the complement and coagulation cascades, extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation, ECM receptor interactions, and cell adhesion molecules. In essence, our study provides a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset and novel insights into adhesive molecule and integrin networks within mesenchymal subclusters in endometriosis. This, in effect, has deepened the understanding of the pathomechanisms governing this condition."

    "title": "Evaluating Renal Glomerular Function in Beta-Thalassemia Patients Receiving Deferasirox Using Serum Cystatin-C and Creatinine: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "abstract": "The introduction of iron chelation therapies has notably extended the life expectancy of individuals with β-thalassemia, thereby presenting the potential for the emergence of new complications such as renal impairments. Because creatinine levels are influenced by body mass and nutritional status, there is a need for a more sensitive and reliable indicator of renal glomerular function. Here, we studied 27 individuals with β-thalassemia undergoing iron chelation therapy with Deferasirox. The serum levels of cystatin-C, a highly sensitive biomarker for renal dysfunction, were quantified using an immunoturbidimetry assay. We subsequently analyzed the data, examining correlations with other clinical and laboratory parameters. We determined the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using both creatinine and cystatin-C-based equations. According to the creatinine equation, none of the patients had a reduced GFR, but 59% exhibited a reduced GFR value based on the cystatin-C equation. Patients with elevated cystatin-C levels exhibited higher serum creatinine (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and BUN (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and lower ferritin (<i>p</i> = 0.023) levels. Our study revealed a positive correlation between cystatin-C and creatinine (<i>p</i> = 0.002), BUN (<i>p</i> = 0.018), and BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.046), while a negative correlation was observed with ferritin (<i>p</i> = 0.006). We found no correlation between cystatin-C and age, weight, height, Deferasirox therapy duration, or blood transfusion frequency. Multiple regression analysis indicated that ferritin (<i>p</i> = 0.003) significantly affected cystatin-C levels, while other variables did not. Additionally, no independent variables had a significant impact on creatinine levels. Since there is a high likelihood of subclinical renal impairment in these patients, we recommend regular monitoring of serum cystatin-C as a screening tool."

    "abstract": "The high variety of mutations found in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene is responsible for the clinical heterogeneity observed in people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the atypical manifestations in CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD). The intronic c.489+3A>G (c.621+3A>G) variant has been reported to have questionable pathogenicity, although its alleged severity was probably due to its co-segregation in cis with another undetected mutation, as previously reported from countries in the Mediterranean region. In the island of Cyprus, several rare CFTR variants have been previously identified, among them the c.489+3A>G in co-segregation with the pathogenic p.Cys1400Ter (cDNA name = c.4200_4201del or legacy name = 4332delTG) mutation. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of these variants in Cyprus and describe their clinical impact in patients and carriers. The intronic variant c.489+3A>G has been so far identified to co-segregate with the pathogenic p.Cys1400Ter mutation in the same allele in six unrelated Cypriot families and in total of 20 subjects. Three of them were diagnosed with CF, presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency and a second CF-causing mutation. Two were diagnosed with CFTR-RD, presenting with bronchiectasis, intermediate sweat test and a second mutation known to cause CFTR-RD. Also, four carriers had a high suspicion of CFTR-RD, with bronchiectasis or emphysema and intermediate sweat test, although due to the lack of another CFTR mutation and a second functional test, definite diagnosis has not been made. Haplotype analysis provided evidence of a common haplotype in all individuals with co-segregation of the c.489+3A>G variant with p.Cys1400Ter mutation. The intronic c.489+3A>G variant co-segregates extensively with p.Cys1400Ter in Cyprus as an ancestral combination due to a possible founder effect. Before providing genetic counselling to subjects identified through population screening to harbour the c.489+3A>G variant, extensive analysis of CFTR including gene rearrangements should be performed to identify possible other mutations in cis, especially in Mediterranean countries where this complex allele is probably common. Further research is warranted to fully delineate the clinical implications of the in cis co-segregation of p.Cys1400Ter with c.489+3A>G, even in the absence of pathogenic variants in the other CFTR allele."

    "abstract": "There is no research explaining the relationship between thalassemia minor and male infertility. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between male infertility and hematological parameters in patients with thalassemia minor. The patients who were identified as thalassemia carriers during premarital thalassemia screening tests performed at the Public Health Laboratory between 2021 and 2023 were evaluated. The patients with normal semen parameters were assigned to the first group, while those with abnormal semen parameters (oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and azoospermia) comprised the second group. The hematologic parameters and hormonal parameters values were examined. The mean age of the patients was 31 (21-43) years. A total of 49 patients with thalassemia minor were included in the study. Of these, 39 had abnormal semen parameters and 10 had normal semen parameters. Among the patients, 8 (16%) had azoospermia, 6 (12%) had oligozoospermia, 9 (18%) had teratozoospermia, and 16 (32%) had asthenozoospermia. The Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) values were significantly lower in patients with abnormal semen parameters (p = 0.01). According to the regression analysis, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) increased the likelihood of deteriorating semen parameters by 0.88-fold, while MCHC increased it by 2.64-fold. Deterioration in sperm parameters was observed in men with thalassemia minor, and hematological parameters-particularly MCHC and MCV-were identified as potential risk factors for infertility. These findings underscore the importance of considering hematological parameters when evaluating fertility in men with thalassemia minor. Infertility is multifactorial and other mechanisms such as oxidative stress and inflammation should also be evaluated."

The association between underlying haematological disease, age at splenectomy and post-splenectomy complications was explored among 1348 splenectomized patients, followed with a median follow-up time of 13 years and affected by transfusion-dependent thalassaemia, non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT), sickle cell anaemia (SCA), congenital haemolytic anaemias, autoimmune haematological disorders and trauma. Our main statistical approach was based on interaction analyses within competing-risk survival models. The baseline risk profile differed across diagnostic categories, with SCA being particularly susceptible to infectious complications and NTDT and SCA to vascular events (p < 0.001). The age at splenectomy did not impact on infectious risk but rather older age at splenectomy was associated with increased risk for vascular complications. Furthermore, the risk of developing a post-splenectomy complication was persistent throughout the observation period and not limited to the first 2-3 years after splenectomy. The probability of a post-splenectomy complication was highly dependent on the underlying disease and not on the age at splenectomy, so the indications for splenectomy must be based on careful assessment of pros and cons in the individual disease, with no need to delay surgery after a certain age when clinically indicated."

    "abstract": "Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Pregnancy significantly impacts hemostasis, leading to a hypercoagulable state. However, women with VWD experience unique challenges due to the interplay between pregnancy-related hormonal changes and VWF deficiencies. This review delves into the intricate relationship between VWD and pregnancy. We explored the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, including hormonal fluctuations, hemodilution, and alterations in platelet-VWF interactions. We discuss how these changes can exacerbate bleeding tendencies in women with VWD, particularly during childbirth and the postpartum period. This review highlights the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in women with VWD and the potential for severe maternal morbidity and mortality. We examine the various types of VWD and their specific implications for pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, we discuss the challenges associated with diagnosing and managing VWD during pregnancy, as well as the importance of prenatal counseling and careful monitoring. The management of VWD during pregnancy involves a multidisciplinary approach, including the use of prophylactic treatments, such as desmopressin and tranexamic acid, as well as factor replacement therapy when necessary. Careful planning of delivery, including the choice of delivery mode and the timing of interventions, is essential to minimize bleeding complications. By understanding the complexities of VWD during pregnancy and implementing appropriate management strategies, healthcare providers can significantly improve the outcomes for women with VWD and their offspring."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is one of the most common inherited blood disorders worldwide. This defect causes a disproportionate ratio of α- and β-globin chains resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis leading to increased iron absorption. In patients where the imbalance between α and β globin chains is great they are dependent on blood transfusions for survival. This results in transfusional iron overload but also comes with additional risks such as transfusion-transmissible viral infections like hepatitis B and C. This can lead to various complications like liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are important causes with morbidity and mortality in patients of thalassemia today. These hepatobiliary manifestations and their management are briefly discussed in this review. Understanding hepatobiliary complications in thalassemia is vital for optimizing patient care."

    "abstract": "India is home to about 42 million people with β-thalassemia trait (βTT) necessitating screening of βTT to stop spread of the disease. Over the years, researchers developed discrimination formulae based on red blood cell (RBC) parameters to screen β-thalassemia trait from iron deficiency anemia (IDA). However, the screening programs often encounter normal subjects (NSs) with other hemoglobinopathy variants. Because the outcome of existing formulas is binary, they often club normal subjects (NS) or variants such as Hemoglobin E (HbE) traits with either βTT or IDA. Therefore, it is necessary to segregate βTT, IDA, HbE, and NS in mixed population data for rational screening. A test data of 2877 subjects with 1226 NS, 425 HbE, 223 IDA, and 1003 βTT were collected from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India and NRS Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, India. First, we evaluated the performance of 25 discrimination formulae and four machine learning algorithms (MLA), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA), eXtreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBC), and SKope-Rules (SKR) based on seven performance measures. Based on the performance measures, we selected four discrimination formulae and two MLAs for further evaluation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model was employed to explore the interpretability of outcomes. We generated four rules using the SKR algorithm to discriminate variants of hemoglobinopathies. Finally, a step-wise implementation scheme for screening is proposed. Results demonstrate that a single formula cannot ensure high performance for all the performance measures. When tested on data set containing βTT and IDA samples, the best-performing formulae appear as SCS<sub>βTT</sub> in terms of sensitivity (SE) and negative predictive value (NPV); Sirachainan in terms of specificity (SP) and positive predictive value (PPV); CRUISE in terms of Youden index (YI) and RF-4 in terms of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and κ-coefficient, respectively. Among MLAs, the best-performing algorithms are Skope-rule regarding SP, YI, PPV, and XGBC in the rest of the measures. When tested on a heterogeneous data set, MCC and κ-coefficient for these four formulae are decreased, but the performance of the two MLAs remains steady. The proposed scheme demonstrates around 97.33-97.62% accuracy while applied to two validation data sets collected from different sources. The performances of XGBC and SKR algorithms for multi-class classification remain steady while segregating different variants of hemoglobinopathies. The developed rules may be helpful for pre-screening individuals and a possible solution for screening in a mixed population with multiple variants for sustainable, cost-effective, and resource-saving screening."

It has previously been described those changes in the ATRX gene (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation, X-linked) are the most common recurring events in the indolent clinical subtype (∼30 %) of MYCN amplified neuroblastoma. There is no effective treatment for this type of neuroblastoma, which is associated with overall poor survival. On the other hand, few studies have detected an association between high-risk (stage IV) non-amplified MYCN neuroblastoma patients and mutant ATRX. In this study, 37 tumor samples from Brazilian patients with stages I to IV MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma, according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS), were analyzed using the panel Oncomine™ Childhood Cancer Research Assay. The authors found two older children (NB1 and NB2) with advanced MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma carried each one of the two following novel nonsense ATRX variants (p.Gln1670* or p.Glu1984*). These variants created a stop codon in the helicase domain of the ATRX gene, leading to ATRX loss-of-function. These mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and the protein loss-of-function was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The finding of these heterozygous mutations in two patients with MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma deserves further investigation. Thus, the authors analyzed each of these cases to better understand how these mutations may be related to disease severity and prognosis. ATRX loss-of-function from p.Gln1670* or p.Glu1984* mutations turn MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma more aggressive and similar to what is seen in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma. This information may help clinical decision-making and facilitate establishing an accurate prognosis for patients with MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma."

Pdp employs strong virulence mechanisms, one of which is the production of the piscibactin siderophore, which plays a key role in iron acquisition from the host. In this study, we evaluated the ferrophilic properties of the Pdp strain EKL1 in relation to growth and biofilm production. In vitro iron limitation significantly suppressed biofilm formation and planktonic growth in EKL1. We then investigated the anti-biofilm activity of deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator used to treat transfusion-induced iron overload in thalassemia patients, against EKL1. DFO strongly inhibited EKL1 biofilm production (by 82.1%), suggesting that iron chelation therapy could be an effective strategy to prevent Pdp-induced photobacteriosis outbreaks. Finally, we characterized the iron-bound form of piscibactin through extensive spectroscopic analyses of the siderophore produced by EKL1. Our findings contribute to the development of novel piscibactin-targeted inhibitors, advancing siderophore-based anti-virulence strategies against Pdp."

In the context of these conditions, preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) plays a pivotal role in preventing genetic diseases in the offspring of carrier parents, reducing the need for pregnancy termination and enabling the selection of compatible sibling donors for potential stem cell transplantation in cases of thalassemia or sickle cell disease. This review explores the evolving role of PGT as a reproductive option for haemoglobinopathy carriers, tracing the development of PGT protocols from patient-specific to comprehensive testing enabled by advanced technologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS). We discuss key technical, biological, and practical limitations of PGT, as well as the ethical considerations specific to haemoglobinopathies, such as the complexity of interpreting genotypes. Emerging technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, non-invasive PGT, and gene editing, hold significant promise for expanding applications but also raise new challenges that must be addressed. It will be interesting to explore how advancements in technology, along with the changing management of haemoglobinopathies, will impact reproductive choices. It is anticipated that continued research will improve genetic counseling for PGT for haemoglobinopathies, while a careful evaluation of ethical and societal implications is also required. Responsible and equitable implementation of PGT is essential for ensuring that all families at risk can make informed reproductive choices."

The present study aims to provide the first comprehensive assessment of clinical experience with expanded carrier screening (ECS) panels in a large cohort from the Jiangxi province of Southern Central China. An ECS panel encompassing 147 genes associated with 155 genetic disorders was initially performed on 5,104 pre-gestational/prenatal females using next-generation sequencing. Following the identification of autosomal recessive conditions in female partners, sequential genetic testing was offered to 1,351 male partners, which included either the same ECS panel or other appropriate genetic tests. Comprehensive reproductive counseling was provided to all the identified at-risk couples (ARCs). Overall, 6,308 participants accepted ECS for 155 conditions (Female: 5,104, Male: 1,204) and approximately 38.43% (2,424/6,308) of them were detected as carriers for at least one of the 155 genetic conditions. The top four prevalent conditions identified in Jiangxi Province were α-thalassemia, GJB2-associated hearing loss, Krabbe disease and Wilson's disease. Among the participated cohort, 1,960 females were identified with AR variants and 1,351 male partners received sequential testing, at a recall rate of 68.93%. Among the tested couples, a total of 36 ARCs (36/1,357, 2.65%) were identified with the same AR (n = 27) or X-linked conditions (n = 9). Our study represents the first large-scale demonstration of the substantial feasibility of ECS in the Jiangxi population of Southern Central China. Based on our findings, we propose that incorporating genes with a carrier frequency threshold of 1/2,000 in the screening panel could serve as an optimal criterion. Our findings may contribute significantly to facilitating future clinical implementations of ECS."

Due to this fact, new parameters that are useful in diagnosing, as well as in assessing, the risk of cardiovascular events, and in future prognosis estimation, should be developed. The left atrioventricular coupling index (LACI) has been recently introduced as the one parameter meeting these criteria. The current review aims to collect all available data and assess whether the LACI may be a valuable tool in daily clinical practice, and, simultaneously, to direct future research on the subject. The LACI is a parameter that can be calculated based on echocardiographic, cardiac CT and CMR examinations. It appears to be of use in several cardiovascular diseases, especially heart failure and atrial fibrillation, both in diagnostics and as a prognostic marker. Moreover, the LACI is a useful marker in cardiomyopathies, myocardial infarction, beta-thalassemia major and light-chain amyloidosis. However, the number of studies on the subject of LACI is limited, and some of these studies are based on the same cohort of patients. Future studies should take up the subject of the LACI, especially when it comes to the value of calculating the LACI based on various imaging techniques, including echocardiography."

    "title": "Heterozygous Beta Thalassemia with Segmental Duplication of chr16p13.3 Leading to Thalassemia Intermedia Phenotype: A Report of 2 Cases with Review of Literature.",
    "abstract": "Heterozygous β-thalassemia is typically asymptomatic, but when accompanied by α-globin gene multiplication, patients may exhibit clinical symptoms. We present two rare cases of heterozygous β-thalassemia where segmental duplications on chr16p13.3 led to increased α-globin gene copies, resulting in a thalassemia intermedia phenotype. One patient exhibited a novel de-novo duplication spanning 2.57 MB, while the other had a 173.8 KB duplication at the chr16p13.3 locus. These two cases are presented to underscore the significance of thorough and systematic evaluation in diagnosing rare forms of thalassemia accurately. Our study also compiles all reported cases of heterozygous β-thalassemia with large segmental duplications on chr16p13.3, leading to an excess of α-globin genes. A total of ten studies have been published in the literature so far. Importantly, the 2.57 MB segmental duplication identified in our study is a novel variant not previously documented in the literature."

    "abstract": "Novel gene therapies (GTs) for sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) are severely limited by manufacturing, intensive care delivery, and high costs, requiring an ethically-justified framework for allocating treatment within GT programs. Using an Accountability for Reasonableness process, we worked with a multidisciplinary committee to develop our program's initial GT allocation framework. This defines the population eligible for GT among patients with SCD and TDT, balancing inclusivity and safety. Among those eligible, prioritization is based on: 1) disease prevalence-based proportionality, 2) those who may not be eligible for GT in the future (\"sickest first\" due to impending organ failure), 3) those without an allogeneic donor, and 4) lottery. Transparent, adaptable frameworks are crucial for just GT allocation. Collaboration across programs is essential for equitable access and mitigating gamesmanship. While this single-center framework cannot address systemic inequities, we hope our transparent process serves as a model for other programs."

Recommendations were developed by the expert Steering Committee (SC) comprising of three Urologists, one Nephrologist, and two Biochemists/Geneticists from the UK, Spain, Germany, and Italy. These recommendations were voted on by invited specialists via an online survey to determine their level of agreement, from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. With an agreement threshold set at ≥ 70%, the SC reviewed the survey results, additional comments, and any areas of disagreement before finalizing the recommendations. A total of 44 recommendations were developed by the SC designed to support the set-up of an ideal MDT. Thirteen core recommendations were chosen as being highest priority and were voted on by 29 invited specialists from 19 countries across Europe, Canada, East Asia, South/Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. All 13 core recommendations reached the ≥ 70% agreement threshold. The remaining 31 recommendations were voted on by those specialists who opted-in to partake in the extended questionnaire. Fifteen specialists provided their responses from 14 different countries. All 31 recommendations reached the ≥ 70% agreement threshold. An ideal MDT process can achieve comprehensive, high-quality, and coordinated patient care, which is especially useful for patients with complex stone diseases. A high level of agreement was reached in areas relating to the implementation of an ideal MDT in identifying high-risk stone formers."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia major is the most common genetic disorder, affecting 60,000 individuals annually worldwide. It involves reduced or absent synthesis of hemoglobin chains, leading to severe anemia. Awareness of its transmission, diagnosis, and prevention is crucial in reducing incidence, especially in high-risk families. This study assessed parental awareness of thalassemia in Kech, Balochistan. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Kech Thalassemia Care Center, Turbat, Balochistan, from May to October 2023, involving 190 parents of children diagnosed with β-thalassemia major. Participants were selected using a convenience-purposive sampling method. A structured questionnaire was developed, piloted, and used for data collection after obtaining informed consent. Ethical approval was granted by Mekran Medical College Turbat. Data were analyzed using SPSS 20. Bayesian linear regression analysis was applied to assess associations. The mean ages of fathers and mothers were 38.18 ± 9.78 and 32.28 ± 7.80, respectively. Most participants (55.3%) lived in rural areas; 63.2% of mothers were illiterate, while 62.6% of fathers were educated. Only 13.7% recognized thalassemia as an inherited disease, and 91.6% were unaware of premarital and antenatal screening. Blood transfusion was seen as the only treatment by 81.1%, and 50% acknowledged the role of consanguinity. Awareness was poor in 48.9% and good in only 4.7% consanguinity and residency showed a significant association with awareness. Parental awareness of thalassemia was inadequate. residency and consanguinity were significantly associated with awareness, highlighting the need for targeted educational interventions."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia, characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, poses a significant public health challenge, particularly prevalent in tribal populations in Sitteri due to consanguineous marriages. Despite its prevalence, there is a notable lack of awareness, leading to misconceptions and barriers to prevention and management. To assess the knowledge and perceived barriers concerning thalassemia among 369 participants in Sitteri, Tamil Nadu, India. Data were collected using a structured knowledge assessment schedule, analyzing demographic factors' association with thalassemia knowledge scores. This study is a cross-sectional study design and sample size estimation was found to be 369 by formula 4pq/d2. The respondents were in the age group 18 to 49 years and they are from the Tribal community. Basic frequency and percentage were incorporated for the demographic profile of the respondents and logistic regression was performed. Only 15% of the respondents have knowledge about Thalassemia and it is shown in the results that higher knowledge scores among older participants (AOR = 12.043, <i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI 3.189-45.472) and females (AOR = 2.916, <i>P</i> < 0.001, 95% CI 1.079-7.879), while higher educational and socioeconomic statuses correlated with lower scores, suggesting disparities in awareness across demographics. Targeted educational interventions, particularly for younger age groups, are essential for enhancing thalassemia awareness. Efforts should prioritize community education programs to raise awareness about thalassemia and its preventive measures, including genetic counseling and prenatal screening. Misconceptions persist, emphasizing the need for targeted educational campaigns. Addressing barriers, such as limited healthcare access and complex screening processes, is vital for effective thalassemia management in Sitteri and similar communities. This study provides valuable insights for designing interventions to enhance thalassemia awareness and reduce its burden in high-risk populations."

    "title": "Therapeutic promise of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia: A current review.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD and β-thalassemia (BT) affects millions of people worldwide. In addition, around 500,000 infants are born with SCD and 60,000 people are diagnosed with BT every year. Mutations in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene are responsible for causing both BT and SCD. Indeed, the diversity of potential mutations in the HBB gene elucidates the diversity in clinical severity observed in individuals with BT and related morbidities. On the other hand, SCD takes place because of the alteration in a single amino acid at position 6 in the beta-globin chain, where a base substitution occurs from glutamic acid to valine, which eventually results in abnormal sickle hemoglobin. Conventional therapies for BT and SCD including pharmaceutical drugs and blood transfusion might temporarily improve the clinical severity of these diseases, however these therapies cannot cure the diseases. CRISPR-Cas9 (CC9) is revolutionizing genome engineering, offering promising therapeutic avenues for genetic diseases. Therefore, CC9-mediated gene therapy provides great hope in the treatment of both BT and SCD. CC9-mediated gene therapy has already demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting both SCD and BT-causing mutations. Moreover, CC9-mediated gene editing was found to be effective in reactivating the expression of hemoglobin F (HbF) and regulating LRF and BCL11A. A number of clinical trials with CC9 gene-edited therapies are being carried out to elucidate their potential in treating BT and SCD. Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of SCD and BT, the mechanism of CC9-mediated gene editing, and common delivery methods of the CC9 system have been discussed in this review. Moreover, an in-depth discussion on applications and the current status of CC9-mediated gene editing in SCD and BT along with current challenges and future perspectives have been provided."

The clinical data of 152 children under the age of 15 who underwent allo-HSCT between January 2011 and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of HC and related variables were evaluated using univariate analysis. Variables with statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05) were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independent risk factors for HC. Among the 152 children, 42 developed HC, with an incidence rate of 27.63%. The median onset time of HC was 25 days (IQR: 10-38.75 days). Univariate analysis indicated that older transplantation age, elevated pre-transplant serum ferritin levels, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and prolonged neutrophil engraftment time were associated with HC occurrence (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression further confirmed that older transplantation age (OR 1.236, 95% CI: 1.031-1.531, <i>P</i> = 0.033), elevated pre-transplant ferritin levels (OR 1.053, 95% CI: 1.028-1.086, <i>P</i> < 0.01), CMV infection (OR 11.522, 95% CI: 2.912-76.345, <i>P</i> = 0.002), and prolonged neutrophil engraftment time (OR 1.385, 95% CI: 1.109-1.793, <i>P</i> < 0.01) were independent risk factors for HC. Older transplantation age (>5.95 age years old), elevated pre-transplant serum ferritin levels, CMV infection, and delayed neutrophil engraftment are independent risk factors for HC in children with severe beta-thalassemia after allo-HSCT. Early identification and intervention for these risk factors are crucial in reducing the incidence of HC."

    "abstract": "Rare diseases present a significant economic burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems worldwide. As the prevalence of these diseases rises in China, data regarding their impact, specifically in Hainan Province, is scarce. Thus, this study aims to evaluate insurance coverage, economic costs, and the factors contributing to the burden of rare diseases in Hainan. We employed a bottom-up approach to analyse the prevalence and economic burden from 2019 to 2023, utilising data from the Hainan Provincial Health Commission Databases. We assessed insurance coverage as well as expenditures related to hospitalisation, diagnostics, medications, surgery, and out-of-pocket costs. Of 4,975 patients diagnosed with 99 distinct rare diseases, 83.01% were insured. From 2019 to 2023, the number of patients increased from 760 to 1,328, while economic costs surged from 34.26 million CNY (US$ 4.89 million) to 64.74 million CNY (US$ 8.86 million). Thalassemia major, one of the most prevalent conditions, generated the highest costs. Hospitalisation expenses accounted for 49.16% of the total costs, with out-of-pocket expenses averaging 17.52%. The findings reveal a significant economic burden associated with rare diseases in Hainan, highlighting the necessity for targeted policy interventions. Furthermore, additional research is needed to refine estimates of this economic burden."

Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that impairs hemoglobin production, leading to anemia and other health complications. Early diagnosis is essential for effective management and prevention of severe health issues. The study applied CNN and XGBoost to two case studies: one for alpha-thalassemia and the other for beta-thalassemia. Public datasets were sourced from medical databases, while private datasets were collected from clinical records, offering a more comprehensive feature set and larger sample sizes. After data preprocessing and splitting, model performance was evaluated. XGBoost achieved 99.34% accuracy on the private dataset for alpha thalassemia, while CNN reached 98.10% accuracy on the private dataset for beta-thalassemia. The superior performance on private datasets was attributed to better data quality and volume. This study highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in medical diagnostics, demonstrating that high-quality data can significantly enhance the predictive capabilities of AI models. By integrating CNN and XGBoost, this approach offers a robust method for detecting thalassemia, potentially improving early diagnosis and reducing disease-related mortality."

A prospective longitudinal real-world study was conducted in adults with TDT in the US and Europe (France, Germany, Italy, UK) over 6 months. Eligibility criteria included receiving ≥ 8 blood transfusions/year in each of the 2 years before enrollment. Study outcomes assessed at months 0, 3, and 6, included demographics, clinical characteristics, patient-reported outcome measures (EQ-VAS, FACT-G, FACIT-F, 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of pain, TranQoL, and WPAI), and responses to bespoke questions on financial burden/distress. Overall, 155 adults with TDT participated (mean age [standard deviation (SD)]: 38.5 [10.8] years; 65.8% female). Most participants resided in the US (53.5%) or UK (22.6%). EQ-VAS, FACT-G, and FACIT-F mean (SD) scores at month 0 were lower among participants than the US general population (67.1 [20.4] versus 80.4 [15.6], 70.1 [19.0] versus 77.0 [16.1], and 27.9 [13.7] versus 43.6 [9.4], respectively; all p < 0.001). Mean (SD) TranQoL total score was 53.9 (18.5) and overall level of pain was \"moderate\" (NRS mean [SD]: 3.5 [2.8]). Part- or full-time employed participants missed a mean of 5.9 h of work in the preceding 7 days with out-of-pocket expenses being a moderate-to-major burden for 55% of participants. The findings were consistent over time. Participants reported substantial humanistic and economic burdens associated with living with TDT. Our findings highlight the need for alternative treatment options that contribute to improvements in HRQoL and reduce economic burden in this patient population."

    "abstract": "Hemolytic anemias involve premature red blood cell (RBC) destruction and present complex phenotypes, including disturbances in iron metabolism, extramedullary erythropoiesis, and systemic organ involvement. To guide the selection of appropriate murine models for studying pathophysiology and pharmacologic treatments of human hemolytic disorders, we systematically characterized three genetic mouse models commonly used to investigate such conditions: sickle cell disease (SCD), β-thalassemia (THAL), and hereditary spherocytosis (SPH). We sought to clarify how these models differ in the severity and nature of hemolysis, the balance between erythropoietic responses and iron regulation, and the long-term patterns of iron distribution. Our findings reveal that SPH mice exhibit severe intravascular hemolysis and suppressed hepcidin levels, leading to unopposed intestinal iron absorption and extensive tissue iron loading, especially in the liver. In contrast, SCD and THAL mice display predominantly extravascular hemolysis, moderate anemia, relatively stable hepcidin levels, and balanced erythropoiesis with partially regulated iron overload. Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing of spleens highlighted distinct erythropoietic progenitor distributions, whereas iron-isotope tracing experiments confirmed divergent RBC turnover kinetics and tissue distribution. This study defines distinct disease trajectories for common hemolytic disease models by providing a unique comparative framework. Our work will support more informed model selection and refined experimental design to investigate hemolytic anemia pathobiology and therapeutics."

The ERN-EuroBloodNet's registry provided real-time registration of SARS-CoV- 2 patients with RBCD, promoting timely disease-specific knowledge sharing during the pandemic's early stages. The study evaluated patient distribution, the infection across different RBCDs, and severity risk factors across similar healthcare systems, using data collected from the ERN-EuroBloodNet's REDCap platform. From April 2020 to April 2023, 681 infections were recorded among 663 patients, of which 373 had transfusion-dependent thalassemia or non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT/NTDT), and 269 had sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD patients had a higher incidence of COVID- 19 than those with TDT/NTDT (10.5 vs. 4.8 COVID/100 patients). Notably, 92% of the cases were mild, with neither age nor the specific RBCD affecting severity. The number of comorbidities, notably obesity and hypertension, that patients had prior to infection was associated with more severe COVID- 19. During the infection, the presence of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, kidney failure, and ground-glass opacities on chest tomography scans were associated with a more severe clinical picture. The vaccination rate (32%) mirrored that of the general population and showed a protective effect against severe COVID- 19. The observed mortality rate was 0.7%, aligning with Europe's general population. SARS-CoV- 2 infection in SCD and TDT/NTDT patients is mild and without higher mortality than the general population. The ERN-Eurobloodnet's registry collaborative structure exemplifies the power of international cooperation in tackling rare diseases, especially during health emergencies."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin H Disease-Constant Spring (HbH-CS) represents a severe variant of α-thalassemia characterized by a fundamental pathological mechanism involving inadequate synthesis of α-globin chains. This deficiency results in the formation of unstable Hemoglobin H (HbH) due to the aggregation of free β-globin chains, which subsequently induces an imbalance in oxidative stress within erythrocytes. This imbalance leads to an abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn promotes lipid peroxidation, culminating in the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and a significant depletion of glutathione (GSH). Concurrently, Nrf2 is translocated to the nucleus, where it activates the antioxidant response element (ARE) to mitigate cellular stress. Here, we report that NSUN3 (which, together with ALKBH1, maintains mitochondrial function through m5C→f5C modification) is abnormally overexpressed in reticulocytes from patients with HbH-CS, and an in vitro cellular model of NSUN3 overexpression/silencing was constructed using K562 cells, which have the potential for erythroid lineage differentiation and retain an intact cluster of bead protein genes. Functional assays indicated that the overexpression of NSUN3 significantly intensified the accumulation of intracellular ROS and MDA, led to a reduction in GSH levels, and diminished the overall cellular antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). This may be due to ROS accumulation resulting from inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, II, and IV synthesis through aberrant m5C→f5C modification. In addition, NSUN3 overexpression further exacerbates oxidative stress by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Nrf2 hindering its translocation into the nucleus and weakening the cellular antioxidant system. Moreover, we also observed that NSUN3 overexpression exacerbated intracellular DNA damage and inhibited cellular value-added activity, and silencing NSUN3 showed the opposite result. Our research offers initial insights into the molecular mechanisms through which NSUN3 modulates oxidative stress in erythrocytes via its role in epigenetic modifications. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the clinical management of patients with Hb H-CS."

    "abstract": "Genetic factors are important causes of congenital hearing loss. To better understand hereditary hearing loss, we performed in-depth clinical and molecular analysis of families with congenital hearing loss and a new disease-related gene, IQGAP3, was identified in this process. This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the IQGAP family which is well known as a GTPase-activating protein involved in various cellular functions. However, there is no research on the relationship between IQGAP3 and the auditory system. This study was conducted at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center and Nantong University from 2019 to 2023 to confirm the relationship between defective IQGAP3 and hearing loss, and further explore the underlying molecular mechanism. We constructed the iqgap3 knockdown zebrafish model, primary mouse inner progenitor cell model and IQGAP3-knockout HEK293T cell line for this research. We found that IQGAP3 deficiency led to abnormal development of the auditory system and impaired auditory function in zebrafish. In vitro studies showed that loss of this gene's function resulted in a 40.29 % reduction in EdU-positive cells and a 44.25 % decrease in Ki67-positive cells in mouse inner ear progenitor cells, indicating reduced proliferation. This can be linked with inhibition of CDC42 enzymatic activity and the blockade of the Wnt-catenin pathway. We identified IQGAP3 as a novel potential causative gene in hereditary hearing loss. Our findings provide important insights into the molecular basis of hereditary hearing loss."

    "abstract": "Iron overload is a major complication in β-thalassemia major (β-TM) patients, resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis, increased gastrointestinal iron absorption and multiple blood transfusions. Excess iron accumulates in various organs, leading to organ dysfunction, and increased risk of thrombotic events. In this study we aim to determine levels of ferritin and its regulation hormone hepcidin in multi-transfused splenectomised and non-splenectomised β-thalassemia major patients and assess a possible correlation with the coagulation protein von Willebrand factor (vWF) and its cleaving protease ADAMTS-13. The study was conducted on 80 β-thalassemia major patients and 80 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma levels of vWF, ADAMTS-13, and hepcidin were assessed using the ELISA method. All patients presented with significantly higher levels of ferritin compared to normal controls (p < 0.001), while hepcidin levels were barely higher in patients (p = 0.05). Ferritin had a positive correlation with vWF antigen levels (r = 0.222, p = 0.05), ADAMTS-13 antigen levels (r = 0.334, p = 0.002) and ADAMTS-13 activity levels (r = 0.353, p = 0.001) in patients. Splenectomised patients had significantly higher levels of white blood cell counts, platelet counts and vWF antigen levels compared to non-splenectomised patients (p < 0.05), but ferritin and hepcidin levels were comparable between the two groups (p > 0.05). Hepcidin was not found to be correlated with any of the measured parameters in patients (p > 0.05). Iron overload is well manifested in our study group despite continuous chelation therapy. Unlike hepcidin, ferritin appeared to be associated with increased secretion of vWF and ADAMTS-13 in patients, while splenectomy had no effect on ferritin or hepcidin levels. These findings highlight the importance of proper iron monitoring in β-TM and recognition of thrombotic risks in managing this anemia."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) persists as a major global health problem, disproportionately affecting children in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Accurate and low-cost point-of-care techniques are urgently needed in LMIC to detect carrier or disease forms with haemoglobin S (HbS) and other variants like β-thalassemia. An open-label, international, multicentre study was conducted at clinical sites in Nepal and Canada. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (HbAA) and participants with known haemoglobinopathies (HbA/β-thalassemia, HbAS, HbS/β-thalassemia, HbSS). The performance of six low-cost tests (Conventional sickling test; HbS solubility test; HemoTypeSC; Sickle SCAN; Gazelle Hb variant test; Automated sickling test using automated microscopy and machine learning) was evaluated against HPLC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05506358). Between September 2022 and March 2023, we enrolled 138 participants (aged 2-74 years; 59% female, 41% male) at clinical sites in Nepal and Canada. Four low-cost tests (HemoTypeSC, Sickle SCAN, Gazelle, and automated sickling), which could identify phenotypes, detected severe SCD (HbSS, HbS/β-thalassemia) accurately (sensitivity >96%; specificity >99%). In contrast, for carrier forms, HemotypeSC and Sickle SCAN only detected HbAS (sensitivity >97%; specificity 100%) and not HbA/β-thalassemia (sensitivity 0%; specificity 100%), while Gazelle detected HbAS (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) and HbA/β-thalassemia (sensitivity 91%, specificity 99%), and automated sickling test detected both trait conditions (HbAS and HbA/β-thalassemia; sensitivity 85%, specificity 85%). When HbS co-exists with β-thalassemia, Gazelle and automated sickling test accurately identify severe SCD and carrier forms. However, HemotypeSC and Sickle SCAN miss β-thalassemia trait, and need to be complemented with other low-cost tests.

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in voluntary blood donations posing a risk of under-transfusion. This study aimed to evaluate and analyze the root causes of challenges from patients' perspectives, helping blood centers achieve adequate blood supply during pandemics and catastrophes. The questionnaire included 15 questions, 10 of which were option-based. The first part collected demographic data and information on the type of blood component transfused. The second part evaluated the patient's thalassemia status, blood requirements, and how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their needs. A response was considered valid if 80% of questions were answered. 280 thalassemia patients responded to the questionnaire receiving regular blood transfusions. During the pandemic, 217 patients needed transfusions less than once a month, 33 (12.5%) saw a decrease in transfusion frequency due to fears of infection, lack of transportation, and reduced needs. However, 7 (2.65%) saw an increase in transfusion frequency. The waiting time for blood also increased for 63.88% patients, by less than two hours for most. COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted thalassemia patients' routine activities, with only 12.5% of patients experiencing reduced transfusion visits due to fear of infection and limited transportation services. Blood donations decreased, but reduced elective surgeries helped balance out. Workforce shortages at blood centers and pandemic management diversions caused delays for some patients. Looking into the past catastrophe from the perspective of the sufferers, especially in thalassemia patients, will enable the policy makers to prepare an organogram to intercept any such future setback."

    "abstract": "The transfusion-dependent form of thalassemia (TDT) presents as a challenging clinical scenario, requiring life-long care and monitoring. Managing a single TDT child is already very challenging for caregivers, and it becomes extremely burdensome if a couple has two children with TDT. The present study aims to make an effort to do a gap analysis in knowledge or communication, which might have resulted in a couple having two children with TDT. A total of 15 couples were identified who had two TDT children during the period from April 2022 to August 2023. Socio-demographic details, clinical history, three-generation pedigree, caregiver's knowledge about the inheritance pattern of thalassemia, the carrier status of 1st and 2nd-degree relatives, and the role of premarital and prenatal screening were recorded. The mean age difference between the first and second child was 2.6 ± 1.6 years, range 1-6 years. Siblings of 80% of TDT children had not been screened, and second-degree relatives of 86.6% of TDT children had not been screened for thalassemia. There was no history of consanguinity among these 15 families. 13.3% of couples were unaware of the inheritance pattern of thalassemia, and 20% were unaware of the role of consanguinity. At the time of interview, 26.6% of couples had not been tested for thalassemia and 40% parents had not received genetic counselling. Eighty percent of couples were unaware of premarital carrier screening for thalassemia, and only 40% knew about prenatal screening. The study highlights inadequate awareness among parents, delayed diagnosis, short intervals between the births of two children, insufficient genetic counselling, traditional societal beliefs, and reliance on traditional healing practices being the main factors leading to parents having two children with TDT."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is the most frequent congenital cause of anemia globally, categorized by anomalous hemoglobin production. Lifelong PRBC transfusion with iron chelation therapy is the only therapeutic option available for the majority. Long-term recurrent blood transfusion has its hindrances like RBC alloimmunization. As there is inadequate data on alloimmunization in the pediatric thalassemia major population, our study aims to find out its prevalence and correlation with the clinical spectrum & transfusion profile. Alloantibody screening was done using 3 cell screening panel that includes antigens D, C, c, E, e, K, k, Fya, Fyb, Jka, Jkb, Lea, Leb, P1, M, N, S, s, Mia, Dia, and Xga. The presence of an unexpected antibody in the patient's serum was considered a positive antibody screen for alloantibody. All samples were further examined to identify antibody specificity using 11 cell identification panels. 6% (5/82) of the included patients demonstrated presence of one or more alloantibodies Alloimmunization was significantly greater in children having their first transfusion after one year of age [OR (95% CI) = 1.42(1.36-1.49), <i>p</i> = 0.02]; receiving > 12 transfusions per year [OR (95% CI) = 1.26(1.12-1.40), <i>p</i> = 0.03] and having > 150 ml/kg/year annual packed RBC consumption [OR (95%CI) = 1.13 (1.08-1.19), <i>p</i> = 0.05].

We enrolled patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia who visited the Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung outpatient clinic. Participants underwent anthropometric measurement, laboratory, and BMD examination. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine the correlation between clinical data and BMD by Pearson or Rank-Spearman depending on data distribution. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the most influential variables using linear regression analysis. <i>p</i> < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall, 59 participants were included. BMD was significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI), sex, average pre-transfusion hemoglobin level, blood transfusion volume, and vitamin D, with coefficient r values of 0.47, 0.34, - 0.27, and - 0.28 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), respectively. BMI was the variable that most influenced BMD, with 0.39 coefficient value, an adjusted coefficient value of 0.32 (0.01-0.04), and <i>p</i> = 0.04. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed BMI had the highest area under the curve (AUC) in all examination areas, especially in the hip area, with 0.800 AUC. 77.8% sensitivity, and 71.7% specificity. BMD was correlated with BMI, sex, average pre-transfusion hemoglobin level, blood transfusion volume, and vitamin D, with BMI being the most influential factor affecting BMD.

Understanding the genetic mutations and their clinical impact is crucial for effective management. To analyze the genetic mutations in thalassemia patients from the Malwa region and correlate them with hematological parameters and clinical severity. Ninety-two patients with clinically diagnosed thalassemia underwent hemoglobin electrophoresis and whole exome sequencing (WES) for genetic analysis. Blood tests, including complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies, were conducted. Statistical analyses were applied to identify genotype-phenotype correlations. WES identified mutations in 91 patients, with Codon 26 (G→A) and IVS-I-5 (G→C) being the most common mutations, affecting 32.6% and 23.9% of the cohort, respectively. Novel mutations were detected in 9 patients (9.7%). Frameshift mutations, particularly at codons 41/42, were associated with more severe anemia (mean hemoglobin 6.9 g/dL) and higher transfusion dependency (85%). Patients with high serum ferritin levels (mean 280 ± 90 ng/mL) exhibited significant iron overload, correlating with increased splenomegaly (p < 0.01). A strong genotype-phenotype correlation was established, with statistical significance observed between mutation types and clinical outcomes (p < 0.01). Our study highlights the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of β-thalassemia in the Malwa region, emphasizing the need for population-based screening and region-specific genetic counselling strategies. The identification of novel mutations, there in-silico pathogenicity predictions, and comparisons with mutation databases further strengthen the claim of novelty and clinical relevance. WES remains a critical tool for improving early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized treatment approaches for thalassemia patients."

Our study aimed to investigate its prevalence, risk factors, and the current compliance to screening and treatment. Women who delivered a baby between 1 October 2019 and 31 December 2019 at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, were included. Haemoglobin levels at booking, 24-28 weeks and delivery were analysed. The frequency of treatment with iron supplementation or blood transfusion was also evaluated. Patient demographics were analysed using descriptive statistical methods, while Pearson's chi-square test was used for analyses of proportions. The prevalence of maternal anaemia at the time of delivery was 17.2%. Significant risk factors included receiving subsidised healthcare (associated with lower socioeconomic status), teenage pregnancy, multiparity, Indian ethnicity, thalassaemia and antepartum haemorrhage (P < 0.05). Compliance to screening was 62.8% at 24-28 weeks. Only 38.4% of women with anaemia at booking and 74.9% with anaemia at 24-28 weeks were prescribed oral iron. A total of 11.2% of women with maternal anaemia received intravenous iron. The mean haemoglobin level of women who received blood transfusion was 8.3 g/dL, which may not have been appropriate. Institutions should create guidelines to standardise the screening and treatment of maternal anaemia and conduct regular audits to monitor their implementation. We recommend a multi-pronged strategy targeting prevention, routine screening, and appropriate treatment of maternal anaemia."

    "abstract": "Patients with beta-thalassemia major (BTM) require frequent blood transfusion due to the nature of the disease. However, frequent blood transfusion may cause alloimmunization and produce unexpected or irregular antibodies, mainly an immunoglobulin G (IgG) that induce hemolysis in these patients and make subsequent blood transfusion difficult. In this cross-sectional study, 135 BTM patients (56 female and 79 male) with age range 5-59 y (28.3 ± 3.9) from southwest of Iran in 2022 were selected. Antibody screening was performed with standard method for the patients, if the patient had a positive screening test, antibody identification was performed. Direct Coomb's test was used for detection the presence of autoantibodies. Laboratory and demographic analysis were performed by Graph Pad Prism software (Version 8.3). Among the 135 examined patients, 8 (5.8%) patients were positive for the antibody screening test; 39.6% anti-K, 24.1% anti-D, and the prevalence of each anti-E, anti-Jkb, and anti-C was 12.1%. None of the patients had autoantibody. No statistically significant difference was observed in the parameters including age, gender, age in the first transfusion, and splenectomy status between immunized and nonimmunized patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The most prevalent unexpected antibodies were anti-K and anti-D, respectively, and anti-C, anti-E, and anti-jkb had the same frequencies. Fortunately, the frequency of unexpected antibodies in the BTM patients was lower compared to some other regions of Iran. One of the reasons for the relatively low amount of alloimmunization in the present study compared to the previous studies from Iran may be due to using regular leukoreduced packed cell unit consumption for the BTM patients. However, the continuation of antibody screening programs and the use of blood negative for the relevant antigen can increase the lifespan of the transfused cells in the patients."

Here, we described a novel 21.9 kb deletion found in a patient with β-thalassemia dur-ing HbA1c measurements. The proband was a 25-year-old female who came to the hospital with her husband for routine prenatal examinations. The hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Hb analysis was performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Routine genetic analysis was carried out by PCR and reverse dot-blot (PCR-RDB) and Gap-PCR. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to screen the deletion in the β-globin chain. Based on the MLPA results, the break location of the deletion was determined by third-generation sequencing (TGS). Sanger sequencing verified the breakpoint in the Gap-PCR amplification products of TGS. HbA1c measurements suggested an elevated HbF value (> 5%) by HPLC, and a retest of the Hb analysis showed an HbF value of 27.9%, and an Hb A2 value of 1.7% using CE. No mutations were detected by Gap-PCR and PCR-RDB. However, MLPA demostrated the presence of large fragment deletion in the β-globin chain. The positions of the deletion were located between 5,225,669 and 5,247,554 on chromosome 11 (chr11: 5,225,669-5,247,554; NG_000007.3:g.50,063-71,947 del) using TGS, spanning the length of 21,886 bp (21.9 kb deletion).

Next generation sequencing has improved our ability to identify underlying molecular causes, though over half of all cases lack a clear etiology. Here, we began with clinical evaluation combined with exome sequencing across independent families to identify bi-allelic candidate genetic variants in the <i>Programmed Cell Death 2 (PDCD2)</i> gene in multiple fetuses with nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF). PDCD2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein with no prior association with monogenic disorders. PDCD2 is known to act as a molecular chaperone for the ribosomal protein uS5, and this complex formation is important for incorporation of uS5 into the 40S subunit, a crucial step in ribosome biogenesis. Primary fibroblasts from an affected fetus and cell lines expressing <i>PDCD2</i> patient variants demonstrated reduced levels of PDCD2, reduced PDCD2 binding to uS5, and altered ribosomal RNA processing. <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles with Pdcd2 knockdown demonstrated developmental defects and edema, reminiscent of the NIHF seen in affected fetuses, and showed altered ribosomal RNA processing. Through genetic, biochemical, and in vivo approaches, we provide evidence that bi-allelic <i>PDCD2</i> variants cause an autosomal recessive ribosomal biogenesis disorder resulting in pregnancy loss."

Unlike CRISPR-Cas9 systems that induce double-strand breaks, ABEs operate through precise deamination, avoiding chromosomal instability. However, the off-target editing effects of ABEs remain inadequately characterized. In this study, we present a biochemical method Selict-seq, designed to evaluate genome-wide off-target editing by ABEs. Selict-seq specifically captures deoxyinosine-containing single-stranded DNA and precisely identifies deoxyadenosine-to-deoxyinosine (dA-to-dI) mutation sites, elucidating the off-target effects induced by ABEs. Through investigations involving three single-guide RNAs, we identified numerous unexpected off-target edits both within and outside the protospacer regions. Notably, ABE8e(V106W) exhibited distinct off-target characteristics, including high editing rates (>10%) at previously unreported sites (e.g. RNF2 and EMX1) and out-of-protospacer mutations. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the off-target landscape associated with ABEs. In summary, our approach enables an unbiased analysis of the ABE editome and provides a widely applicable tool for specificity evaluation of various emerging genome editing technologies that produce intermediate products as deoxyinosine."

    "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia major patients often require regular blood transfusions, leading to iron overload, oxidative stress, and disturbances in lipid metabolism. The common use of vitamins and iron chelators helps mitigate some of these effects, but lipid profile abnormalities persist. The oak fruit (<i>Quercus brantii</i>) is rich in antioxidant compounds, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, which may help address these issues. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the aqueous extract of Iranian oak on the lipid profile and liver enzymes in beta-thalassemia major patients. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 60 beta-thalassemia major patients (29 males, 31 females; age 10-60 years) who regularly received blood transfusions and deferoxamine. Participants were divided into two groups: the intervention group received Iranian oak extract capsules (300 mg/day), and the control group received placebo capsules for 3 months. Lipid profiles (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL) and liver enzymes (ALT, AST) were measured before and after the intervention. The control group exhibited a significant increase in triglyceride levels (from 167 to 184 mg/dL, <i>p</i> < 0.03), while no significant changes were observed in the intervention group. In contrast, total cholesterol significantly decreased in the oak extract group (from 125 to 112 mg/dL, <i>p</i> < 0.003). HDL levels decreased in both groups (<i>p</i> = 0.008 for the intervention group; <i>p</i> = 0.016 for the control group). No significant differences were found in LDL, ALT, or AST levels between the two groups. The aqueous extract of Iranian oak demonstrated potential lipid-modulating effects by preventing triglyceride increases and reducing cholesterol levels in beta-thalassemia major patients. These findings suggest that the antioxidant properties of the oak extract may help manage lipid abnormalities associated with iron overload, improving cardiovascular risk profiles in these patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes and extended follow-up are recommended to confirm these benefits. http://www.irct.ir, identifier IRCT2015101411819N4."

This study was conducted between June 2021 and June 2022 at a regional thalassaemia centre in Sri Lanka. The study includes 100 sets of samples, including a BTT and an age-matched, sex-matched and body mass index-matched healthy individual from the same household in each set, aged between 6 and 25 years. The primary outcomes were serum folate levels and the daily dietary intake of folate in BTTs and controls. Serum folate levels were determined using a fully automated Cobas immunoassay analyser. The dietary folate intake was determined by recording 24-hour dietary recall recorded over 3 consecutive days, with the average intake calculated. The results suggested that 34% of cases and 24% of controls had serum folate deficiency (<3 ng/mL), while 37% of cases and 49% of controls were at risk (3-5.9 ng/mL) for folate deficiency. Overall, the serum folate level was not significantly different between the cases (mean; 4.88 ng/mL) and the controls (mean; 4.76 ng/mL) (p=0.759). Dietary folate intake was lower than the recommended dietary allowances in both groups, but not significantly different between the groups. There were high levels of folate deficiency in both controls and those with BTT, while those with BTT were no more likely to be folate deficient than the controls. Based on our findings, a policy of indiscriminate folic acid supplementation for all with BTT does not seem rational."

    "abstract": "The recent approval of the first gene editing therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demonstrates the immense potential of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technologies to treat patients with genetic disorders that were previously considered incurable. While significant advancements have been made with ex vivo gene editing approaches, the development of in vivo CRISPR/Cas gene editing therapies has not progressed as rapidly due to significant challenges in achieving highly efficient and specific in vivo delivery. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have shown great promise in clinical trials as vehicles for delivering therapeutic transgenes and other cargos but currently face multiple limitations for effective delivery of gene editing machineries. This review elucidates these challenges and highlights the latest engineering strategies aimed at improving the efficiency, specificity, and safety profiles of AAV-packaged CRISPR/Cas systems (AAV-CRISPR) to enhance their clinical utility."

    "title": "Variability in Health Outcomes According to Pediatric to Adult Transfer-of-Care Status Among Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease.",
    "abstract": "Transitioning from pediatric to adult care is critical for young adults with sickle cell disease. While the transfer typically occurs at age 18, some pediatric providers continue care into adulthood. This study evaluates whether remaining in pediatric care versus transferring to adult care affects health outcomes. We hypothesized that those who remain in pediatric care after age 18 would experience fewer acute health-care events and better outcomes than those who transfer to adult care. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at HEMORIO, a blood center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Health-care utilization (outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations), hydroxyurea use, care abandonment, and mortality were compared among young adults with sickle cell disease aged 18-23 under pediatric or adult care. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Among 472 eligible patients (50% female, 71% Hb SS or Hb Sβ0 thalassemia), 81 (17%) remained in pediatric care, while 391 (83%) transferred to adult care. After age 18, patients in pediatric care had fewer emergency visits and hospitalizations compared to those in adult care. Transferred patients showed increased emergency visits and hospitalizations relative to their adolescent period, whereas those remaining in pediatric care experienced reduced rates of these events. Transitioning to adult care is associated with increased adverse outcomes despite more frequent ambulatory visits. Enhancing transition programs to improve adult care integration and engagement is essential to address these disparities."

    "title": "The induction effect of hydroxyurea and metformin on fetal globin in the K562 cell line.",
    "abstract": "Despite the established efficacy of hydroxyurea (HU) in increasing fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with intermedia beta-thalassemia (β-thal) and sickle cell anemia, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely elusive. Understanding these mechanisms is paramount for identifying alternative therapeutic approaches to increase Hb F production while minimizing adverse effects. In this study, we employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate the molecular underpinnings of γ-globin switching within GSE90878 dataset. Leveraging this information, we aimed to predict the transcriptome network and elucidate the mechanism of action of HU and Metformin (Met) on this network comprehensively. Through bioinformatic analysis, we identified IGF2BP1 and GCNT2 as key regulators of the γ-globin switching mechanism. To experimentally validate these findings, we utilized the K562 cell line as an erythroid model. Cells were treated with HU (50, 100, and 150 µM) and Met (50, 100, and 150 µM) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The expression levels of the GCNT2, γ-globin, IGF2BP1, miR-199a/b-5p, miR-451-5p and miR-144-3p were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our results revealed that treatment with HU (150 µM), Met (100 µM), and combination of HU-Met (150/100 µM) significantly increased IGF2BP1 expression by 6.2, 5.3, and 7.1-fold, respectively, after 24 h treatment. Furthermore, treatment with HU (50 µM), Met (50 µM) and HU/Met (50/50 µM) for 24 h led to a 3.3, 1.2, and 5-fold decrease in GCNT2 gene expression, respectively. Notably, the highest levels of γ-globin expression and Hb F production were observed with HU (100 µM), Met (50 µM), and HU/Met (100/50 µM). This study provides compelling evidence that HU and Met significantly enhance γ-globin expression and Hb F production in the K562 cell line. Our findings suggest that these drugs exert their effects by modulating the expression of IGF2BP1 and GCNT2, thus offering valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for disorders characterized by low Hb F levels."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia is a common monogenic disorder caused by genetic defects in β-globin genes (HBB), resulting in imbalanced synthesis of α-/β-globin and ineffective erythropoiesis. It has been well documented that β-thalassemia patients, or even carriers, mostly experience re-activation of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), but its underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. We took advantage of a previously established cohort of 1142 β-thalassemia patients with diverse thalassemic mutations subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing. Genotype-phenotype association studies demonstrated that the HBB: c. -78A>G showed a remarkable effect on the elevation of Hb F levels compared to other β-thalassemic mutations. To experimentally validate the conclusion above, the RNP transfection complex through homology-directed repair (HDR) by electroporation was performed, from which we observed a consistent increase of Hb F expression in both HUDEP-2 and primary CD34+ cell lines. Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR, Dual-luciferase reporter assay, and circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) assays validated a decreased occupancy of the HBB TATA-Box by TBP, leading to boosted expression of γ-globin genes by enhanced interaction between locus control regions (LCRs) and γ-globin gene promoters. The patient-based investigation and experimental validations presented in this study might lead to a better understanding of stage-specific globin-gene expression mediated by competitive binding of distal enhancers (LCRs)."

    "abstract": "Increasing fetal-type hemoglobin (HbF) expression in adult erythroid cells holds promise in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia. We have identified MLL1 complex as a critical regulator of fetal and embryonic hemoglobin repression. Knockdowns of <i>MEN1</i> and <i>KMT2A,</i> encoding essential components of the complex, caused a significant downregulation of <i>BCL11A</i> expression and a substantial increase in γ- and ε-globin mRNA levels in HUDEP-2 cells. Significant binding of MEN1 and KMT2A were readily detected at the promoter and a critical enhancer of <i>BCL11A</i> in HUDEP-2 cells, suggesting that <i>BCL11A</i> is a direct transcriptional target of MLL1 complex. Consistent with these results, <i>MEN1</i> or <i>KMT2A</i> knockdown in normal human CD34 <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) induced to undergo erythroid differentiation also significantly decreased their <i>BCL11A</i> expression and increased their γ- and ε-globin expression and the production of F cells in the culture. Treatment of these cells with MENIN inhibitors yielded similar results and promoted erythroid differentiation with minimal effects on their growth. These findings underscore a critical role of MLL1 complex in regulating fetal and embryonic hemoglobin expression and suggest that MENIN inhibitors could offer a promising therapeutic approach for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia."

This study focuses on Hemoglobin C (HbC) disease, a structural hemoglobinopathy with diverse clinical and hematological manifestations. HbC disease is particularly relevant in populations with high consanguinity rates, where its phenotypic expression and associated complications warrant further investigation. The aim of this study is to describe the hematological profile of patients with HbC disease diagnosed at the Central Hematology Laboratory of Ibn Sina University Hospital over a two-year period. A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted on 37 cases of HbC disease identified between November 2022 and November 2024. The study population included AC heterozygotes, CC homozygotes, SC compound heterozygotes, and HbC/beta-thalassemia combinations. The hematological evaluation comprised complete blood counts, reticulocyte counts, blood smear analysis, and hemoglobin fraction quantification using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The study identified four distinct HbC phenotypes: heterozygous AC (HbAC), homozygous CC (HbCC), compound heterozygous SC (HbSC), and HbC/beta-thalassemia combinations. The SC phenotype was associated with the most severe hematological abnormalities, including significant hemolysis and anemia. Variations in red blood cell morphology and hemoglobin fractions were observed across phenotypes, with elevated fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels noted in HbSC patients. This study highlights the phenotypic diversity of HbC disease in a Moroccan population, emphasizing the role of consanguinity and genetic background in disease expression. The findings underscore the importance of tailored diagnostic and management strategies to address the burden of hemoglobinopathies in high-consanguinity regions."

    "abstract": "Centrifugal microfluidic platforms are highly regarded for their potential in multiplexing and automation, as well as their wide range of applications, especially in separating blood plasma and manipulating two-phase flows. However, the need to use stroboscopes or high-speed cameras for monitoring these tasks hinders the extensive use of these platforms in research and commercial settings. In this study, we introduce an innovative and cost-effective strategy for using an array of light-dependent resistors (LDRs) as optical sensors in microfluidic devices, particularly centrifugal platforms. While LDRs are attractive for their potential use as photodetectors, their bulky size frequently restricts their ability to provide high-resolution detection in microfluidic systems. Here, we use specific waveguides to direct light beams from narrow apertures onto the surface of LDRs. We integrated these LDRs into electrified Lab-on-a-Disc (eLOD) devices, with wireless connectivity to smartphones and laptops. This enables many applications, such as droplet/particle counting and velocity measurement, concentration analysis, fluidic interface detection in multiphase flows, real-time monitoring of sample volume on centrifugal platforms, and detection of blood plasma separation as an alternative to costly stroboscope devices, microscopes, and high-speed imaging. We used numerical simulations to evaluate various fluids and scenarios, which include rotation speeds of up to 50 rad/s and a range of droplet sizes. For the testbed, we used the developed eLOD device to analyze red blood cell (RBC) deformability and improve the automated detection of sickle cell anemia by monitoring differences in RBC deformability during centrifugation using the sensors' signals. In addition to sickle cell anemia, this device has the potential to facilitate low-cost automated detection of other medical conditions characterized by altered RBC deformability, such as thalassemia, malaria, and diabetes."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia are the major hemoglobinopathies associated with anemia. Bone marrow transplants or blood transfusion are frequently employed as treatment for these diseases, and erythropoietin analogues are sometimes used to boost erythropoiesis to compensate the destruction of RBCs. RBCs of hemoglobinopathy patients have reduced pyruvate kinase activity and increased oxidative stress, which makes the RBCs prone to destruction and precipitate vaso-occlusive crises and pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate desidustat, a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer in beta thalassemic mice (B6.D2-Hbb<sup>d3th</sup>/BrkJ) model, phenylhydrazine-induced acute hemolysis in C57 mice model, and sodium metabisulfite-induced sickling in sickle cell disease patient's blood. Desidustat treatment increased hemoglobin, RBCs, and hematocrit in both mice models. Desidustat treatment decreased iron overload, splenomegaly, and oxidative stress in phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia in mice. Desidustat treatment increased pyruvate kinase activity in RBCs of human, mice, and rats in a dose-dependent manner, and reduced sickling in SCD patients' RBCs. These data indicate that desidustat stimulates pyruvate kinase and attenuates oxidative stress in red blood cells, causes erythrocytosis in thalassemic mice, and reduces sickling in sickle cell patient's blood."

    "abstract": "Vietnam is estimated to have approximately 30,000 hemophilia B (HB) carriers, with hundreds of new cases registered annually. However, comprehensive molecular studies on HB remain limited. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize genetic variants and assess their clinical significance in unrelated Vietnamese patients with HB. This study included a cohort of 143 unrelated HB patients with diagnosed FIX levels. Genetic analysis of the <i>F9</i> gene was performed using DNA sequencing and other molecular techniques. Variant pathogenicity was classified following ACMG/AMP guidelines, supplemented by computational predictions and clinical data. A 100% variant detection rate was achieved, identifying 83 unique variants from 143 patients. Single nucleotide variants were predominant, with missense variants accounting for 71.08%. Of the 83 unique variants, 20 novel variants were identified, including six missenses, four nonsenses, four frameshifts, two large deletions, two in-frame deletions, and two splice-site variants. The serine protease domain contained the highest proportion of variants (49.4%). Pathogenicity analysis revealed a predominance of severe phenotypes (72.03%). Among the novel variants, twelve were classified as pathogenic, one as likely pathogenic, and seven as variants of uncertain significance. A noteworthy case was the NM_000133.4:c.-21C>T promoter variant associated with HB Leyden, which demonstrated age-dependent improvements in factor IX levels. This study expands the mutational spectrum of HB in the Vietnamese population and provide critical insights into genotype-phenotype correlations. The identification of novel variants enhances diagnostic precision and underscores the importance of comprehensive genomic analyses in understanding disease mechanisms."

The hallmarks of the disease include ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic hemolytic anemia, and iron overload. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic carriers to severe anemia requiring lifelong blood transfusions with subsequent devastating complications. The management of patients with severe β-thalassemia represents a global health problem, particularly in low-income countries. Until recently, management strategies were limited to regular transfusions and iron chelation therapy, with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation available only for a subset of patients. Better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of β-thalassemia syndromes and associated clinical phenotypes has paved the way for novel therapeutic options, including pharmacologic enhancers of effective erythropoiesis and gene therapy."

We present a case of a 30-year-old pregnant woman with thalassemia intermedia and asplenia, who experienced a combined respiratory-haemodynamic collapse following an emergent caesarean section performed for eclampsia, and in whom a large mass transversing a patent foramen ovale was observed on bedside echocardiography. In view of the patient's unstable condition, mass' size and location as well as accompanying inter-atrial communication-all of which contributed to an imminent threat to cerebral circulation-and temporal proximity to abdominal surgery and epidural anaesthesia, an immediate open-heart surgery was decided upon that included mass excision and patent foramen ovale closure, and after which the patient quickly and fully recovered. Histopathologic examination of the mass revealed a mixture of thrombotic and amniotic fluid elements. Acute pulmonary embolism was eventually confirmed by computed tomography performed on post-operative day 2. Early echocardiography and surgical intervention, as dictated by a multidisciplinary collaboration, allowed for a favourable outcome in our patient, emphasizing their pivotal role in the management of a life-threatening presentation of an intracardiac thrombus-in-transit."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder that can impact fertility due to various factors such as iron overload and endocrine disruption. While the effects of iron overload on fertility outcomes in transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) have been well-documented, there is limited data on how NTDT affects assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes. This study aims to assess the fertility and pregnancy outcomes of NTDT patients compared to thalassemia carriers (TC) patients in IVF and frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 6,911 female patients who underwent autologous IVF treatment at a private reproductive center between January 2013 and December 2022. The study included women who were carriers of thalassemia or diagnosed with NTDT. ART outcomes, including oocyte retrieval rate, embryo development (maturation rate, number of fertilized oocytes and blastocyst formation rate), clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate, were compared between NTDT and TC patients. Propensity score matching (PSM) and multivariable adjustments for potential confounders were applied in the statistical analyses. NTDT patients had a significantly lower oocyte retrieval rate (0.88 vs. 0.93, p < 0.05) and a longer interval from medication initiation to oocyte retrieval (13.35 days vs. 12.38 days, p < 0.05) compared to TC patients. However, NTDT patients exhibited higher oocyte maturation rates and a greater number of fertilized oocytes. Despite these differences in embryo development metrics, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates between NTDT and TC patients in both fresh embryo transfer (IVF-ET) and FET cycles (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that while NTDT may affect certain aspects of embryo development, it does not significantly impact overall pregnancy outcomes in ART. This study provides valuable insights into ART outcomes for NTDT patients, showing that, despite challenges in oocyte retrieval, their fertility and pregnancy outcomes are comparable to those of thalassemia carriers. Clinicians should consider individualized treatment plans and provide comprehensive counseling for NTDT patients, focusing on their specific fertility characteristics, to optimize ART outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms affecting embryo development in NTDT patients and to confirm these findings in broader populations."

However, this gene variant does not account for all chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk. We hypothesized that we could develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CKD in SCA, combining APOL1 G1/G2 with other candidate genes that modify SCA severity and further stratify patients into risk categories based on this risk score. Variants in APOL1, HMOX1 (rs743811), BCL11A (rs1424407), and α-thalassemia (α <sup>-3.7</sup>) were identified in children with SCA enrolled in the Sickle Cell Clinical Research and Intervention Program longitudinal cohort (SCCRIP). We individually tested the association of these variants with persistent albuminuria, tested a three-variant PRS (PRS-3) (APOL1, BCL11A (rs1424407), and α<sup>-3.7</sup>), and developed a four-variant PRS (PRS-4) after adding HMOX1 (rs743811) to PRS-3 using the summation of high-risk alleles. An adult SCA cohort from the University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC), was used for validation. Persistent albuminuria was defined as having a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g on at least 2 of 3 consecutive measurements. In both cohorts, APOL1 risk variants increased the risk while α-thalassemia protected against persistent albuminuria. PRS-4 was significantly associated with persistent albuminuria (SCCRIP: p = 0.004; UIC: p = 0.00016). When stratifying patients into three and four risk categories based on the PRS, 58% and 86% of the high-risk (PRS-3) and 54% and 89% of very high-risk (PRS-4) categories developed persistent albuminuria cases in the SCCRIP and UIC cohorts, respectively.

    "abstract": "Packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions are the primary treatment for thalassemia. However, chronic transfusions ultimately result in iron overload, causing heart, liver, and endocrine complications along with other comorbidities. Although iron chelation is routinely initiated to remove excess iron, adherence remains a challenge, and iron overload still contributes to significant morbidity and early mortality in thalassemia. We review the evidence for iron overload and its complications in thalassemia. We also assess iron chelation strategies with possible adherence challenges categorized as patient-, medication-, and system-related barriers. Evidence suggests that lower adherence rates have been associated with more endorsed barriers. Further, patient-related barriers could be internal or external, and taking a patient-centered approach is key to addressing these challenges. Choosing the right iron chelator could help overcome some medication-related barriers. Finally, insurance coverage and access to specialized centers could affect initiation of iron chelation. A critical and routine assessment of adherence barriers is key to optimizing patients' adherence to iron chelation. Adherence is often a multifactorial process, and it varies over time. Shared decision making with patients and/or caregivers is an important next step to improving adherence to iron chelation, and ultimately health outcomes."

Several reported series of patients managed with intravascular intrauterine transfusions (IVT's) prior to 20-22 weeks' gestation have been associated with a perinatal mortality of 20 %. It would therefore seem appropriate to define EOS-HDFN as a fetal demise, hydrops fetalis or the need for intrauterine transfusion for suspected fetal anemia prior to 20-22 weeks' gestation. Evaluation of the patient in her next pregnancy with EOS-HDFN history should include a free fetal DNA analysis at 10-12 weeks' gestation to confirm the at-risk fetus. Weekly middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity determinations using Doppler ultrasound should be initiated by 15 weeks' gestation. Immunomodulation with intravenous immune globulin with or without plasmapheresis should be considered as early at 10-12 weeks' gestation. If IUT's are required prior to 20 weeks' gestation, an intraperitoneal approach can be used until a more advanced gestation can be attained when intravascular fetal access is possible.

Increase in the concentration of oxygenated HbS in red blood cells (RBCs) has been considered as a novel approach to inhibit HbS polymerization and reduce RBC sickling and their complications, raising interest for novel oxygen affinity modulators. This review summarizes the characteristics and primary results obtained with osivelotor, a novel oxygen affinity modulator, for the treatment of SCD. Osivelotor is presented with improved pharmacokinetic properties comparatively to voxelotor. It may enable higher hemoglobin (Hb) occupancy at lower doses potentially leading to significant improvements of clinical outcomes. The first clinical phase 2/3 trial with osivelotor reported increases of Hb levels and RBC counts, and decrease of RBC sickling. The treatment was apparently well tolerated. However, osivelotor shares the same mechanism of action as voxelotor, and therefore similar limitations regarding its efficacy for which the improvement in Hb level appears misleading. Several issues remain to be resolved before considering any drug approval."

    "title": "[Practice-oriented rational assessment of anemia].",
    "abstract": "Anemia is frequently diagnosed in the daily clinical routine and is an indicator of a more or less severe underlying disorder. An understanding of the diverse and complex etiology is crucial for a practice-oriented diagnostic approach. In principle, there are many differential diagnoses. The diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that anemia is often multifactorial, especially in old age. A rational clarification of anemia takes epidemiological data and the individual medical history into account. Classification according to erythrocyte indices plays a central role. The most important cause of hypochromic microcytic anemia is iron deficiency, with thalassemia and anemia of chronic disorders (ACD) as differential diagnoses. Hyperchromic macrocytic anemia is mainly caused by disturbances of vitamin B12 and folic acid metabolism or the DNA synthesis. The group of normochromic normocytic anemias includes most of the subtypes of anemia. In unclear cases, a referral to a hematologist for clarification is recommended."

    "title": "Role of gut microbiota in thalassemia: a review of therapeutic prospects.",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the study of gut microbiota has gradually become a research hotspot in the field of medicine, as gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely related to various diseases. Thalassemia, as a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, has a complex pathophysiological mechanism, and traditional treatment methods show limited efficacy. With a deeper understanding of the gut microbiome, researchers have begun to focus on its role in the pathogenesis of thalassemia and its therapeutic effects. This article aims to review the role of gut microbiota in thalassemia and its potential therapeutic prospects, analyze the latest research findings, and explore the impact and mechanisms of gut microbiota on patients with thalassemia, with the goal of providing new ideas and directions for future research and clinical treatment of thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is one of the most prevalent monogenic disorders in tropical and subtropical regions, imposing significant familial and social burdens on local populations. It is caused by point mutations or structural variations (SVs) in the α- or β-globin gene clusters. Due to the complex structure, full characterization of SVs has always been the focus and difficulty of molecular diagnosis of thalassemia patients. Peripheral blood of a Chinese boy with β-thalassemia intermedia phenotype and his family members were collected. Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA), long-read sequencing (LRS) and Sanger sequencing were used to analyze the variant in this family. A novel large duplication (αααα<sup>280</sup>) was identified using LRS technique and validated by Sanger sequencing. Additionally, we conducted a systematic review of known SVs and evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of various methods in analyzing complex SVs. Our study identified a novel SV in the α-globin gene cluster and demonstrated that LRS was a superior approach for detecting novel rare SVs. The appropriate use of LRS significantly improves diagnostic accuracy when conventional methods are not capable of completely identifying complex SVs."

    "abstract": "We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 228 HbS/β<sup>+</sup>-thal patients. The different genotypes were distributed into three groups according to their mean residual HbA levels: <10 % (group 1; n = 22), between 10 and 20 % (group 2; n = 175) and > 20 % (group 3; n = 31). Routine red blood cells and hemoglobin parameters were compared between the three groups. Sixteen different sickle β<sup>+</sup>-thal genotypes were identified but only four of them were associated with a residual HbA level below 10 %. Patients of this group exhibited a more severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/dL; reticulocytes >200 G/L) compared to the two other groups. However, no difference could be observed on those parameters between patients of group 2 and 3, as well as for the main RBC parameters. According to our study, >80 % of the sickle β<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia patients in France have a residual HbA level beyond 10 % and a mild to moderate anemia. Only four β<sup>+</sup>-thal variations (all affecting the splicing process) would lead to a potentially severe SCD syndrome in association with HbS (HbA < 10 %) but this result should be confirmed in a prospective clinical study."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to synthesize evidence on disease-specific outcomes in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase to identify publications up to May 2023, including patients with SCD or TDT treated with allo-HSCT. Occurrence of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) including acute pain, acute chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration in SCD, and red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) requirements in TDT were the main outcomes of interest. Transplant-related outcomes such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure/rejection were summarized in the studies that reported main outcomes. Proportion of patients experiencing VOCs or RBCTs, GVHD, and graft failure/rejection after allo-HSCT were aggregated and descriptively reported with range across studies. Thirty-one SCD studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies assessed for VOC and pain crisis events after allo-HSCT; 11 studies reported ≥1 VOCs after allo-HSCT in 6.9% of the 2,760 patients. Graft failure was reported in 14.4% (0.9%-18.8%, 14 studies) of patients, graft rejection in 5.5% (1.6%-100.0%, 12 studies) of patients, acute GVHD in 22.4% (1.6%-50.0%, 19 studies) of patients, and chronic GVHD in 20.4% (3.3%-57.1%, 14 studies) of patients. Seventy-eight TDT studies met inclusion criteria. Fifty-six studies reported that 8.8% of the 3,107 patients required RBCTs after allo-HSCT. Graft failure was reported in 5.4% (1.1%-80.0%, 21 studies) of patients, graft rejection in 7.5% (0.5%-42.9%, 50 studies) of patients, acute GVHD in 28.4% (5.2%-100.0%, 57 studies) and chronic GVHD in 15.2% (1.3%-50.0%, 51 studies) of TDT patients. Based on this SLR, after allo-HSCT, a portion of patients with SCD continue to experience VOCs and a portion of patients with TDT continue to require RBCTs, in addition to experiencing GVHD and graft failure or rejection."

    "abstract": "Severe haemolytic anaemia is a rare and often overlooked presentation of folic acid deficiency. Here we describe a case of severe haemolytic anaemia secondary to folic acid deficiency in a patient with beta thalassaemia trait. A 20-year-old young woman of Pakistani origin, previously independent and active with no significant past medical history, presented with vertigo, dizziness, tiredness, and muscle stiffness. On admission, she had a haemoglobin level of 23 grams/L, folic acid level <1.3 micrograms/L with evidence of haemolysis. Her peripheral blood film was consistent with severe haematinic deficiency. Following diagnosis of severe normocytic anaemia and non-immune extravascular haemolysis secondary to folate deficiency, she received blood transfusions and high-dose oral folic acid for three months. On follow-up, haemoglobin level had improved to 104 grams/L, folate levels were replenished, and she had resumed her normal life. She was incidentally found to have beta thalassaemia trait which explained the persistent mild anaemia. Hence, folic acid deficiency when significant may lead to severe haemolytic anaemia but shows excellent haematological response to treatment with high dose oral folic acid."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by anemia. In Japan, beta-thalassemia occurs in only 1 in 1000 individuals, and reports of thalassemia in patients with breast cancer are extremely rare. We report a case of triple-negative breast cancer in which thalassemia manifested as progressive anemia during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A Filipino woman in her 40 s with a family history of breast cancer presented with a left breast mass. Physical examination revealed a 2-cm palpable mass in the outer lower quadrant of the left breast. Ultrasonography confirmed a 21-mm irregular hypoechoic mass in the corresponding area with immunohistochemistry indicating a triple-negative phenotype (ER-, PgR-, HER2-negative, Ki-67 index 60%). Pembrolizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin were administered every 3 weeks, during which the hemoglobin (Hb) level gradually decreased. Thalassemia was diagnosed based on low pretreatment mean corpuscular volume (67.6 fL), presence of target cells in peripheral blood, and elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. Despite the anemia progression, the patient was able to complete the planned chemotherapy regimen with blood transfusion support. This included 4 cycles of pembrolizumab, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Subsequently, a partial mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, and the patient achieved a pathological complete response. This case demonstrates that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer can be successfully completed with appropriate blood transfusion support in patients with thalassemia-induced anemia."

    "abstract": "The cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T2* mapping technique is widely used to quantify myocardial iron and assess iron overload in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). However, the value of T2 mapping in detecting iron overload and its consistency with T2* mapping in the myocardium of pediatric patients are unknown. Thus, this study sought to explore the utility and feasibility of using T2 mapping to assess iron overload, and to provide an alternative non-invasive method for the assessment of iron overload in clinical practice. Vitro iron-water phantom models with different iron concentrations were used to analyze the correlation between the T2 and T2* values. In total, 113 TDT pediatric patients were prospectively enrolled in the study and underwent CMR examinations using a Philips 1.5T scanner, and T2 and T2* mapping of the short-axis of the left ventricle were performed. Pearson correlation analyses, Bland-Altman plots, the Student's <i>t</i>-test or Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were applied to analyze the data. Excellent negative correlations were found between the actual iron concentration and the measured T2* (r=-0.919, P=0.003) and T2 values (r=-0.888, P=0.008) of the vitro iron-water phantom models. Additionally, the measured T2* and T2 values of the phantom models were positively correlated (r=0.997, P<0.001). Bland-Altman plots revealed that the T2* and T2 values showed good agreement at the basal, middle, and apical levels of the left ventricle short-axis. The areas under the ROC curves for the diagnosis of myocardial iron overload by T2 mapping in the basal, middle, and apical segments were 0.78, 0.95, and 0.89, respectively. The T2 mapping technique may serve as an alternative and complementary method to the T2* mapping technique in assessing iron overload in TDT patients, which provides a new use of routine T2 mapping."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and types of hemoglobinopathies among newborns in Thumbay Teaching Hospital, Ajman-UAE, over three years (2020-2022), and to analyze demographic trends. A laboratory-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 6,050 newborns screened using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). We consider this study and its results as a new effort in the field of hemoglobinopathy research and management in Ajman in the United Arab Emirates. The final main findings revealed different hemoglobinopathy cases. In 2020 Two cases (2) involving Hb C variant were recorded, both of African origin (from Sudan and Egypt). The third case was Hb D variant which was also of African origin (Egypt). In 2021 no case was found. In 2022, the results showed a widespread of cases; A patient from Nigeria reported having Hb C, three cases of Hb D from Pakistan, two cases of Hb E trait from people in Bangladesh and India, one case of Hb S from Malawi, five cases of Hb S trait from people in Africa (two from Kenya, one from Tanzania), and two cases from Asian people from Yemen. The total number of detected hemoglobinopathies was 15 cases, accounting for a percentage of (0.2%). The study reveals a diverse presence of hemoglobinopathies among newborns in Ajman and underscores the importance of newborn screening programs to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, particularly in regions with high genetic disorder prevalence. The study revealed almost an obvious African origin of Hb C and S cases and Asian one of Hb E and D cases."

Ongoing research explores the potential of CRISPR technology for cancer therapies, HIV treatment and other complex diseases. Despite its remarkable potential, CRISPR technology faces challenges such as off-target effects, suboptimal delivery systems, long-term safety concerns, scalability, ethical dilemmas and potential repercussions of genetic alterations, particularly in the case of germline editing. Here, we examine the transformative role of CRISPR technologies, including base editing and prime editing approaches, in modifying the genetic and epigenetic codes in the human genome and provide a comprehensive focus, particularly on relevant clinical applications, to unlock the full potential and challenges of gene editing."

    "abstract": "This study investigated hemoglobin (Hb) variant prevalence and molecular characteristics in Laibin City, Central Guangxi, China. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), 33,958 individuals from six regions within Laibin area were screened, with hematological parameters analyzed via automated cell counters. Gap-PCR/RDB-PCR identified common α/β-thalassemia mutations, while Sanger sequencing characterized Hb variants. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing was performed to identify breakpoints in a sample with a large duplication and to detect multiple mutations in another sample. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used for duplication validation. Among 231 Hb variant carriers (0.68% prevalence), 18 mutation types were identified: 7 α-chain, 6 β-chain, and 5 δ-chain variants. Hb New York was most frequent (30.3%, 70/231), followed by Hb E (27.3%, 63/231) and Hb Q-Thailand (20.8%, 48/231). Two novel variants-Hb Laibin (<i>HBA2</i>: c.44T>C) and Hb Anti-Lepore Laibin-were discovered, alongside China's first reported Hb Matsue-Oki case. In conclusion, we observed a high carrying rate of Hb variants in Laibin City. Our findings contribute to the increasing number and diverse heterogeneity of Hb variants in Central Guangxi, which should be useful for genetic counseling and the prevention of hemoglobinopathies. The flexible application of a diverse array of molecular detection techniques is essential to avoid missed diagnoses and achieve high diagnostic efficiency."

    "abstract": "Beta (β) thalassemia is an inherited disorder that occurs following mutations or deletions in the β globin gene. Rarely, it is caused by variants in genes coding for erythroid transcriptional factors or trans-acting factors. Here, we report three novel variants of <i>SUPT5H</i> revealed by next generation sequencing. This, gene has been progressively acknowledged as a mimicker of β thalassemia trait in two independent individuals and one family. These individuals have the same features, including hypochromic microcytic indices, increased Hb A<sub>2</sub> levels, without mutations in the β globin gene. The three novel <i>SUPT5H</i> variants identified in this study (c.1168_1169del, c.2688del and c.307+1G>A) are frameshift variants leading to a premature stop codon or an intronic variant predicted to alter the splice site consensus sequence by <i>in silico</i> software. All three variants are characterized as Loss-of-Function variants either by generating a truncated protein or haplo-insufficiency due to nonsense-mediated decay. These findings confirm the general observation that most variants in <i>SUPT5H</i> associated with a β thalassemia trait phenotype are Loss-of-Function variants. This gene should be considered as a potential target gene in the genetic diagnosis of any unsolved cases of increased HbA<sub>2</sub> and unexplained inconsistency of phenotype and genotype of β thalassemia intermedia."

    "abstract": "Giant appendicoliths, which are calcified deposits larger than 2 cm found in the appendix, are uncommon and often linked to appendicitis, as well as complications like perforation or abscess formation. The occurrence of a giant appendicolith leading to peritonitis without accompanying appendicitis is rare, presenting a distinct diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A 77-year-old male with beta-thalassemia minor came in with acute pain in the right lower quadrant, along with nausea and vomiting. Upon examination, he showed signs of peritoneal irritation, including rebound tenderness and guarding. Laboratory tests indicated mild leukopenia and normal inflammatory markers. Imaging studies identified a 5 cm appendicolith and localized free fluid suggestive of perforation, along with signs of superimposed peritonitis. Surgical intervention revealed a distended appendix containing the giant appendicolith and an ileocecal perforation, but histopathological analysis showed no evidence of acute appendicitis. The patient underwent an appendectomy and repair of the perforation, resulting in an uneventful recovery. Giant appendicoliths can lead to significant mechanical irritation and complications such as perforation, even in the absence of the typical inflammatory response associated with appendicitis. The diagnostic difficulty arises from the lack of fever and elevated inflammatory markers, which are usually present in cases of acute appendicitis. Giant appendicoliths should be included in the differential diagnosis for acute abdominal pain, even when appendicitis is not evident. This case highlights the necessity of thorough approaches for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment."

In patients with these tumors ≥55 years at diagnosis, clinical, histopathologic, and prognostic characteristics are less clear. Here, we compared histopathological, immunohistochemical, molecular, and overall survival of 34 patients aged ≥55 years with a group of 84 patients aged 19-54 years; all had IDH mutant astrocytomas. The older cohort had 14 World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2, 7 WHO grade 3, and 13 WHO grade 4 tumors versus 24, 32, and 28 WHO grade 2, 3, and 4 tumors in the younger group. Comparing equal-grade tumors in both cohorts, Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis revealed that patients ≥55 years of age showed worse prognosis despite receiving comparable treatment regimens (Stupp protocol). Roughly equal numbers of noncanonical IDH mutations were seen in both groups (11.76% in ≥55 vs 19.04% in <55). Older patients were more likely to show retention of nuclear protein alpha-thalassemia and mental retardation X-linked syndrome (ATRX) and/or absence of strong P53 staining by immunohistochemistry. Although patients ≥55 years of age with astrocytomas, IDH-mutant, had worse overall survival, many, particularly those with low-grade tumors, had 5 years or greater survival. Employing parallel treatment regimens with chemotherapy, radiation, and maximum safe resection may improve survival of older patients with IDH mutant gliomas."

    "abstract": "The reactivation of developmental silenced γ-globin genes (HBG1/2) has shown promise as a therapeutic strategy for improving symptoms of β-hemoglobinopathies. Currently, the focus of therapeutic targets is primarily on the major fetal hemoglobin suppressors, such as BCL11A and ZBTB7A and of their binding sites on the proximal HBG promoter. However, the role of the distal HBG promoter in regulating gene expression remains to be explored. We used CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the distal HBG promoter. In vitro and in vivo assays, as well as engrafted NCG-Kit-V831M mice, were used for functional validation and mechanistic studies. We discovered an insertion of nucleotide A (insA) between - 1368 and - 1369 bp upstream of the TSS in HBG2 resulting in remarkable increase in γ-globin expression in HUDEP-2 cells. We also observed elevated γ-globin expression in human CD34<sup>+</sup> erythroid progenitor cells from healthy individuals and those with β-thalassemia when introducing insA mutation. Similarly, engrafted NCG-Kit-V831M mice showed increased γ-globin expression. Importantly, neither did insA have any off-target effects nor did it affect the maturation of erythroid cells. Furthermore, we found that the insA mutation created a binding site for the transcription activator FOXO3, which was activated by AMPK. Additionally, introducing insA specifically demethylated the - 162 CpG site on HBG promoter by reducing the enrichment of DNA methyltransferase 3 A (DNMT3A). At the same time, it activated histone modifications and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in both distal and proximal HBG promoter and might inhibit the binding of BCL11A and ZBTB7A on -115 and - 200 sites on the HBG promoter respectively. In addition, combination of insA and the - 115 or -200 editing targets resulted in an amplify effect in reactivating γ-globin genes expression. Overall, we presented the preclinical data to support the role of insA on regulating γ-globin expression using CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC cells derived from healthy donors or patients with β-thalassemia, and subsequently engrafted mice. Our study suggests that introducing insA mutation leads to significantly boosted fetal globin levels and uncovers new safe therapeutic target or strategy for β-hemoglobinopathies."

PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify the relevant studies published before November 2024. Cardiac and hepatic MRI are now well-established modalities, integrated into the clinical practice. They have become essential for tailoring iron chelation therapies to the specific patient's needs and for monitoring treatment efficacy. The improved control of cardiac iron burden has translated into reduced morbidity and mortality. The MRI accessibility remains limited in resource-limited settings and progress in this field relies on educating and training centers to ensure accurate execution and interpretation. The clinicopathological significance, prognostic value, and reproducibility of pancreatic iron levels assessment have been established, charting a path toward its clinical use.

This was a secondary analysis of data collected prospectively from pregnant women at risk for fetal Hb Bart's disease assessed at 17-22 weeks' gestation, receiving care at the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit, Chiang Mai Hospital, Thailand, between January 2008 and December 2023. Each fetus underwent prenatal measurement of MCA peak systolic velocity (PSV) and MCA-VTI. Final diagnosis of Hb Bart's disease was confirmed by Hb typing of cord blood, obtained by cordocentesis. MCA-PSV and MCA-VTI were evaluated both as absolute values and multiples of median (MoM) normalized for gestational age. Diagnostic performance of MCA-PSV and MCA-VTI for predicting fetal Hb Bart's disease was evaluated and compared using area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values. A total of 485 fetuses at risk for Hb Bart's disease (109 affected, 376 unaffected) met the inclusion criteria. Absolute MCA-VTI values were significantly higher in affected compared with unaffected fetuses (7.9 ± 1.8 vs 5.4 ± 1.3; P < 0.001) as were MoM values (1.5 ± 0.3 vs 1.0 ± 0.2; P < 0.001). The diagnostic performance of MCA-VTI was superior to that of MCA-PSV for detecting fetal anemia due to Hb Bart's disease, with AUCs of 0.877 (95% CI, 0.836-0.917) and 0.898 (95% CI, 0.857-0.938) for absolute MCA-VTI values (in cm) and MCA-VTI MoM, respectively, compared with 0.842 (95% CI, 0.795-0.889) and 0.854 (95% CI, 0.809-0.899) for absolute MCA-PSV values (in cm/s) and MCA-PSV MoM, respectively (P < 0.001). MCA-VTI is more accurate compared with MCA-PSV for predicting fetal Hb Bart's disease, which indirectly reflects anemia. This suggests that MCA-VTI could serve as an alternative or adjunct to MCA-PSV for detecting fetal anemia, particularly in cases of Hb Bart's disease and potentially for other etiologies. © 2025 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."

The growing incidence of genetic disorders in maternal-fetal medicine has intensified the demand for precise and accessible NIPT options, which aim to minimize the need for invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. Cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), the core analyte in NIPT, is influenced by numerous factors such as maternal DNA contamination, placental health, and fragment degradation. dPCR, with its inherent precision and ability to detect low-abundance targets, demonstrates robustness against these interferences. Although NGS remains the gold standard due to its comprehensive diagnostic capabilities, its high costs limit widespread use, particularly in resource-limited settings. In contrast, dPCR provides comparable accuracy with lower complexity and expense, making it a promising alternative for prenatal testing."

In this case report, we present a 67-year-old male patient, following mitral valve repair, who developed anemia within 2 weeks of the repair. Evaluation with echocardiography did not initially show findings of worsening mitral regurgitation, however, his anemia and kidney function worsened over the next 6 months. Further evaluation, during that time showed worsening mitral valve regurgitation in repeated echocardiography, with renal hemosiderosis confirmed via kidney biopsy, revealing glomerulosclerosis with hemosiderin deposits. Due to persisting anemia and worsening kidney function, the patient is being planned for a mitral valve replacement. The potential recovery of renal function remains uncertain. Despite the common occurrence of intravascular hemolysis following prosthetic valve placement or valve repair, only a few cases of acute renal failure have been reported. In these cases, severe hemolytic anemia developed shortly after surgery, within 2 weeks, with increased levels of creatinine, even reported as high as 8.2 mg/dL and renal biopsy revealed acute tubular injury and widespread tubular hemosiderosis, resembling the findings in the index case. Diagnosis depends on the evaluation of anemia, showing signs of hemolysis, with echocardiology findings of worsening valvular abnormalities, and kidney biopsy findings showing hemosiderin deposits. Treatment strategies encompass the management of anemia alongside considerations for either mitral valve replacement or repair. This case underscores the importance of considering the possibility of renal hemosiderosis, associated with mitral valve repair. The delay in diagnosis observed in this case is not uncommon, and timely recognition becomes pertinent to prevent irreversible renal injury and improve long-term outcomes."

    "title": "iFGF23 Plasma Levels in Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia: Insights into Bone and Iron Metabolism.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> FGF23 is a phosphate homeostasis regulator; the literature suggests a link between FGF23, iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis. Little is known about the FGF23 level variations in β-thalassemia (βT), which is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload. Our cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the iFGF23 level variations in a large cohort of βT patients considering their bone mineral densities (BMDs) and iron loads. <b>Methods</b>: Clinical, biochemical and radiological data were collected from 213 transfusion-dependent βT (TDT) adults referring to the Regional HUB Centre for Thalassaemia and Haemoglobinopathies in Ferrara, Italy. The iFGF23 levels in the TDT patients were compared to the general population's reference range. The BMDs and hearth and liver iron deposits were assessed with DEXA scans and MRI, respectively. <b>Results</b>: The iFGF23 distribution in the TDT subjects is significantly different from that of the general population. The iFGF23 levels are positively correlated with the age at transfusion initiation and calcium and phosphate levels and are negatively correlated with the osteocalcin plasma levels. Patients treated with deferasirox had lower iFGF23 levels than those treated with other chelators. The iFGF23 levels are not correlated with the BMD or iron status. <b>Conclusions</b>: These findings provide insights into the relationship between the iFGF23 and bone and iron metabolism in TDT patients. Further studies are needed to explore its potential clinical relevance."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia major is a chronic genetic disease requiring long-term treatment, significantly impacting the quality of life of affected children and their parents. Parents often experience emotional, social, and economic burdens in caring for children with thalassemia. Nursing interventions play a crucial role in improving their quality of life by providing holistic support. This scoping review aims to explore nursing interventions that enhance the quality of life of parents with children diagnosed with thalassemia major. A scoping review methodology was applied. Literature searches were conducted in CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus, as well as Google Scholar. The primary keywords included \"nursing intervention,\" \"quality of life,\" \"thalassemia,\" \"parents,\" and \"family support.\" Inclusion criteria comprised full-text, original research articles published in English from 2015 to 2024. Data extraction was performed manually, and qualitative descriptive analysis was used. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, discussing various nursing interventions to improve parental quality of life. Effective interventions included positive thinking therapy, family empowerment, counseling, and education, which enhanced parental knowledge, coping skills, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life. Key factors supporting intervention success included active parental participation, continuous healthcare support, and the availability of accessible educational resources. This study highlights the essential role of nurses in supporting parents of children with thalassemia. A holistic nursing approach is crucial in addressing the multifaceted needs of these parents. Further research should explore the long-term effectiveness of these interventions and their adaptation to individual family circumstances."

    "abstract": "Molecular characterization was performed for investigation of β-globin gene cluster in a pregnant Chinese female with mild microcytic hypochromic anemia accompanied with complicated hemoglobin fractions. Routine hematological parameters and hemoglobin analyses were conducted using an automated cell counter and capillary electrophoresis, separately. Long-read single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing was employed to molecularly characterize this individual. Hematological indices showed mild microcytic hypochromic anemia, and hemoglobin analyses demonstrated normal HbA2 percentage of 2.3% and increased HbF value of 13.1% in this female. SMRT thalassemia genetic testing showed a heterozygous β<sup>+</sup> mutation <i>HBB</i>:c0.316-197C > T (β<sup>IVS-II-654 (C>T)</sup>) and heterozygous <i>HBG2:</i>c.-211C > T (-158Gγ (C > T)), which has independently been reported to result in elevated HbF levels. A variant <i>HBD</i>: c.-127T > C (-77 (T > C)) was also identified in the promoter region, which has been frequently reported to result in normal HbA2 levels in patients with β-thalassemia. All the three variants were further validated by Sanger sequencing. Moreover, SMRT analysis unraveled a novel duplicated structural variation of <i>HBG1</i>/<i>HBG2</i> (<sup>G</sup>γ<sup>A</sup>γ/<sup>-158(C>T)GγGγGγAγ</sup>), a rearrangement of four γ-globin genes including one entire <i>HBG1</i> and three entire <i>HBG2</i> in one chromosome. We herein first described a novel structural quadruplet γ-globin genes of <i>HBG2</i> by SMRT and reported the molecular characterization of a complex thalassemia with variants involving <i>HBG1</i>/<i>HBG2</i>, <i>HBD</i> and <i>HBB</i> genes. Our work may facilitate genetic counseling and bring insight into future diagnosis of complex thalassemia."

    "title": "Controlled release of deferiprone using iron-responsive nanoparticles integrated with dissolving microneedle for novel alternative treatments of β-thalassemia major.",
    "abstract": "Iron chelating agents (ICs) such as conventional deferiprone are often ineffective when exposed to normal conditions due to their uncontrolled release when treating iron overload in ß-thalassemia major (ß-TM) due to the effects of blood transfusion. Iron deficiency and gastrointestinal side effects are crucial problems that can occur. Therefore, DFP was prepared as nanoparticles (NPs) coated with an iron-responsive (IR) polymer with an average particle size of 354.70 ± 10 nm to control its release. To facilitate optimal delivery, NP-IR-DFP was integrated into a dissolving microneedle (DMN) fabricated with biodegradable and biocompatible poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and poly(vinyl alcohol) polymers. The results showed that the NP-IR-DMN provided excellent insertion and mechanical strength and dissolved quickly after application. In vitro and ex-vivo studies revealed the more controllable release of NP-IR-DFP after integration with the DMN (NP-IR-DMN) for up to 24 h. Most importantly, the developed formula was hemocompatible and did not irritate the skin or cause tissue damage. Furthermore, the in vivo pharmacokinetics were further investigated for 24 h, which revealed short concentration (C<sub>max</sub> of 0.07 ± 0.03 μg/mL) and t<sub>1/2</sub> (3.66 ± 0.76 h) under normal conditions and long-term iron overload-modeling conditions with C<sub>max</sub> (2.90 ± 0.14 μg/mL) and t<sub>1/2</sub> (10.13 ± 1.00 h). This approach can extend beyond oral delivery by controlling the release of DFP, which can only be released in conditions of iron overload, and has the potential to prevent iron deficiency and excess, thus increasing the efficacy of DFP in β-TM therapy."

    "abstract": "We investigated the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and prognostic role of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and non-dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy (NDLVC) in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (β-TDT). We retrospectively included 415 β-TDT patients who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance to quantify myocardial iron overload (MIO) and biventricular function parameters and to detect replacement myocardial fibrosis. Demographic and laboratory parameters were comparable among patients with no overt cardiomyopathy (NOCM; <i>n</i> = 294), DCM (<i>n</i> = 12), and NDLVC (<i>n</i> = 109), while cardiac size and systolic function were significantly different. Compared to NOCM patients, DCM and NDLVC patients had a higher prevalence of MIO and replacement myocardial fibrosis. During a mean follow-up of 57.03 ± 18.01 months, cardiac complications occurred in 32 (7.7%) patients: 15 heart failures, 15 supraventricular arrhythmias, and 2 pulmonary hypertensions. Compared to the NOCM group, both the NDLVC and the DCM groups were associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiac complications (hazard ratio = 4.26 and 8.81, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, the independent predictive factors were age, MIO, and the presence of DCM and NDLVC versus the NOCM phenotype. In β-TDT, the detection of NDLVC and DCM phenotypes may hold value in predicting cardiac outcomes."

    "abstract": "This case report presents a 66-year-old male who developed deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and a ruptured iliac aneurysm as initial manifestations of primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Due to the presence of pre-existing aneurysms in combination with anticoagulation therapy, the patient experienced a retroperitoneal hematoma, necessitating temporary cessation of treatment. Genetic testing revealed a JAK2 V617F mutation and bone marrow biopsy confirmed PMF. The patient's recovery was uneventful, with hematological parameters stabilized upon discharge. The case emphasizes the importance of considering myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in the differential diagnosis of unexplained thrombotic events. JAK2 mutations are linked to thrombotic complications and aneurysm formation, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring. It is also important that MPNs may not initially be evident in a complete blood count, while coexisting conditions, such as β-thalassemia trait in this patient's case, can alter the blood count findings."

    "abstract": "β-Thalassemia major is a complex, multisystemic condition. Effective transfusion programs, optimal iron chelation therapy, and progresses in magnetic resonance imaging have significantly improved patient survival. Despite these advancements, the fundamental pathophysiology remains unaltered, leading to an increase in comorbidities and cancer diagnoses with advancing age. We report a unique case of coincidentally discovered thymoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis in a patient with β-thalassemia major. A 56-year-old Italian female patient with β-thalassemia major underwent magnetic resonance imaging to quantify myocardial, hepatic, and pancreatic iron deposition. Her medical history included transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, splenectomy, and cholecystectomy. At the time of magnetic resonance imaging, she had no significant endocrine, cardiac, or hepatic complications and was on deferasirox, vitamin D, and luspatercept. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lobulated mass in the prevascular mediastinum, which showed mild radiotracer uptake on positron emission tomography. Chest computed tomography revealed multiple thin-walled cysts in the lungs, indicating lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Following multidisciplinary evaluation, the patient underwent thoracoscopic thymectomy and lung wedge resection. Histopathology confirmed type B2 thymoma and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Post-surgery, the patient was recommended for adjuvant radiation therapy and sirolimus treatment. This is the first reported case of the coincidental discovery of thymoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis in a patient with β-thalassemia major. This case emphasizes the importance of thorough radiologic evaluations in patients with β-thalassemia to detect potential neoplastic conditions early. Enhanced awareness among clinicians and radiologists is crucial for the timely diagnosis and management of these patients."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a group of heterogeneous hemolytics. Anemia is characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance Due to impaired synthesis of hemoglobin (Hb). The most common types of Thalassemia are Thalassemia and beta-thalassemia, which are named for the hemoglobin chains they affect. Blood from Thalassemia patients differs from the blood of healthy human beings due to function abnormalities such as reduced hemoglobin synthesis, changed crimson blood cell architecture, and scientific indicators of anemia. Heavy metal (HM) toxicity has been described as a risk factor for the development of Thalassemia in women and men; its assessment can predict susceptibility to Thalassemia (Thal.) HM levels of Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), and Uranium (U) were evaluated in non-smoking individuals from outside and inside the holy city of Najaf. Eighty-two females, aged (9-40) years, and forty controls (11-45) years, were recruited into this case-control study. As well as the possibility of a relationship between the disease and radiation through detection of blood Uranium levels. The concentration values of the studied elements were determined in units (ppb) for Cadmium and lead after their digestion using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). In contrast, uranium concentrations (ppb) were measured using a solid-state nuclear track detector (CR 39) by measuring the radon concentration. The average ± standard deviation (SD) for (Cd) concentrations in the serum of the control group were higher (19.405 ± 1.117) ppb compared to the serum of Thalassemia individuals (1.570 ± 0.658)ppb, with high statistical significance (P < 0.05), while (Pb) in the serum of the control group (32.051 ± 8.423) ppb and vice versa was the lowest compared to the serum of Thalassemia individuals, with high statistical significance. As for (U) concentrations, they were close between the two groups, respectively, and the p-value was greater than 0.05. The ANOVA analysis between the concentrations of the studied elements was statistically significant. Cd was positively correlated with Pb (r = 0.204, P = 0.066). The relationship between Cd and U has been neglected (r = 9.011, P = 0.922). As for Pb and Cd, the correlation was positive and weak (r = 0.204, P = 0.066). The serum concentrations of the studied elements in Thalassemia individuals outside the city of Najaf were higher than those of Thalassemia individuals inside the city of Najaf. The current study showed a difference in the mean differences in the concentrations of the studied elements between the Thalassemia group and the control group, and the location was important, as it was found that the concentrations were higher for the Thalassemia group outside the city of Najaf compared to the Thalassemia group inside the city."

    "abstract": "To describe the characterization of a novel deletion causing α-thalassemia. The proband was a 4-year-old boy who presented with abnormal hematological parameters identified during routine blood investigation conducted for a cold. Three common α-globin gene deletions, three mutations, and 17 mutations in the β-globin gene were detected using PCR-flow fluorescence hybridization. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and CNVplex technologies were employed to identify potential rare pathogenic mutation types. The CNVplex technology leverages variations in the lengths of linkage sequences of differential sequences at the same locus to produce linkage products of varying lengths, thereby enabling the detection of multiple loci within the same system. The newly identified deletions were further validated using customized third-generation sequencing (TGS) and Sanger sequencing. In this study, hematological analysis indicated a potential diagnosis of thalassemia in the proband, characterized by typical microcytic hypodermic features. A novel 134-kb deletion in the α-globin gene cluster was identified in this proband using the CNVplex technology. This deletion encompasses the genes <i>HBZ</i>, <i>HBM</i>, <i>HBA2</i>, <i>HBA1</i>, and <i>HBQ1</i>. Furthermore, we confirmed the gene deletion through customized TGS testing and Sanger sequencing, allowing us to determine the size of the deletion. The results suggest that this represents a new deletion of 146 kb that has not been previously reported, and we hypothesize that this deletion is likely the primary cause of the α-thalassemia trait observed in the proband."

    "title": "Analysis of Common Alpha-Globin Gene Abnormalities and Their Effects as Genetic Modifiers in Thai Children With β-Globin Gene Abnormalities.",
    "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia exhibits a broad phenotypic range influenced by the severity of <i>HBB</i> mutation and various genetic modifiers. One of the most essential modifiers is the coinheritance of α-globin gene mutation. Nevertheless, the understanding of these α-globin variations' impact on beta-thalassemia is lacking among pediatric patients. This study investigated the impact of common α-globin gene mutations on clinical phenotype and hematological parameters in 122 Thai children with either β-thalassemia diseases or carriers recruited from Phramongkutklao Hospital, a major thalassemia center. Clinical characteristics, transfusion history, and hematological parameters were recorded, with molecular testing for common α-globin deletions and Hb CS mutations. The cohort included 8 homozygous β-thalassemia, 55 β-thalassemia/Hb E, 18 homozygous Hb E, 26 heterozygous Hb E, and 15 heterozygous β-thalassemia children. Coinheritance of α-globin mutations was less frequent in β-thalassemia diseases (6 of 63) than in β-thalassemia traits (25 of 59) (<i>p</i> < 0.001), indicating a potential modifier effect that reduces severity. Among β-thalassemia/Hb E patients, single α-globin deletions or Hb CS mutations were linked with lower Hb E, MCV, and MCH. Similarly, in both β-thalassemia and Hb E traits with α-globin gene mutation had significantly lower MCV, MCH and Hb E levels (only in the Hb E trait) and elevated RDW. Moreover, lower hematocrit and hemoglobin in these carriers were noted in cases coinherited with deletional Hb H disease initially undiagnosed by Hb typing. In conclusion, the diagnostic value of hematological parameters and Hb typing in identifying common α-globin mutations in pediatric β-thalassemia patients were highlighted. Hematological parameters are vital indicators that may prompt genetic screening to confirm α-globin abnormalities, supporting improved diagnosis and management of complex αβ-thalassemia syndromes."

    "abstract": "Anemia remains a significant public health concern with adverse effects among children. Noninvasive screening assessments enable the early detection and prompt treatment of anemia. However, there is limited literature on the use of such screening assessments. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with being at risk of anemia among Malaysian children aged ≥6 months to ≤36 months by using a noninvasive hemoglobin assessment. This was a cross-sectional study (from July to December 2022) of outpatient Malaysian children, aged ≥6 months to ≤36 months, who were selected from five maternal-and-child health clinics by convenience sampling. At risk of anemia was defined as a total hemoglobin level of <12 g/dL, measured using the Masimo Rad-67, a noninvasive screening device for total hemoglobin levels. The χ2 and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the prevalence and factors associated with being at risk of anemia, using R-Studio (version 4.0.0). The study included 1201 participants, of whom 30% (95% CI 28-33) were at risk of anemia. Children aged 6-12 months (210/364, 57.7%, P<.001), those of Asian Malay race (238/364, 65.4%, P<.05), those residing in the Klang district (123/371, 33.9%, P<.05), those born via a normal vaginal delivery (275/364, 75.5%, P<.05), those without a family history of thalassemia (284/364, 78.0%, P<.05), and those with lower weight-for-age Z scores (P<.05) were associated with being at risk of anemia. Children aged 6-12 months (adjusted odds ratio=1.73; 95% CI 1.34-2.24) had higher odds of being at risk of anemia compared to children aged >12-36 months. However, weight-for-age (adjusted odds ratio=0.88; 95% CI 0.80-0.98) was associated with lower odds of being at risk of anemia. The current study revealed a substantial prevalence of Malaysian children being at risk of developing anemia. The study results therefore imply a need for more community education and awareness on anemia, including nutrition education, as well as targeted community screening to enable the early detection and prompt treatment of anemia cases. Anemia reduction strategies in Malaysia should consider the highlighted factors indicative of higher risk of anemia."

In the Terai region of southern Nepal and northern India, the Tharu people has a high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies, including beta and alpha thalassemia. This study sought to ascertain the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in Tharu school-age children in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, as well as the associated hematological and demographic traits. In cooperation with the National Medical Organization (NMO) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the study was carried out between February 22-26, 2023. 369 blood samples were taken from youngsters enrolled in school. The BIORAD VARIANT algorithm was utilized to diagnose thalassemia characteristics and hemoglobinopathies using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The relationships between hematological markers, diagnostic results, and demographic factors were assessed by statistical analysis. (1) Normal cases: 78.8% of participants were classified as normal. (2) Beta thalassemia heterozygous: 6.2%. (3) HbJ Meerut heterozygous: 4.0%. (4) HbS heterozygous: 9.8%. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between sex and diagnosis (p=0.001), while no significant association was observed between age and diagnosis (P = 0.846). Hematological parameters, including Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), differed significantly across diagnostic groups (P < 0.05). Variations in hemoglobin types Hb A, Hb F, and Hb A2 were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The study highlights a high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies within the Tharu community, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis and awareness campaigns to manage the disorder effectively. By reducing stigma and empowering the community with knowledge, these efforts can improve outcomes for individuals with thalassemia and related disorders."

    "abstract": "The occurrence of a single beta thalassaemia allele is frequently related with microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and a rise in HbA2 levels. In some beta thalassaemia carriers, the outcome of this allele or its collaboration with other acquired or genetic defects may result in normal or borderline Haemoglobin bA2 levels. Objective was to establish the importance of molecular analysis in borderline HbA2 individuals and its significance in a population screening program. It was a cross-sectional study conducted over a period of six months, from July-December 2023. All 123 individuals with borderline HbA2 levels between (3‒3.9%) diagnosed by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/Capillary Zone Electrophoresis underwent molecular testing using multiplex amplification refractory mutation system-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-PCR) to detect common beta thalassaemia mutations: Fr8-9, IVS1-5, Fr41-42, Cd15, Cd5, IVS1-1, IVS1-1, Cd30, Cd30, Fr16, IVSII-1, Del619, and CAP+1 in the Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi .Statistical tests were applied to compare Red Blood Cell indices and Haemoglobin A2 values among beta thalassaemia carriers and non-carriers. Among those tested, 47.1% (n=58) were found to carry Beta thalassaemia mutations. The most prevalent mutations were IVS1-5 (n=19,15.4%) and Fr8-9 (n=19,15.4%) followed by Fr41-42 (n=08,6.5%). Subjects with mutations exhibited significantly lower mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin compared to those without mutations (p-value= <0.001). Beta thalassaemia mutations were seen more frequently when HbA2 was in range of 3.5-3.9% (n=37,63.8%), as compared to HbA2 that was 3-3.4% (n=21,36.2%) and this difference was found to be significant (p-value= <0.001). The CAP+1 mutation was associated (n=02,1.6%) with normal mean MCV and MCH compared to other identified mutations. It is concluded that molecular study for the common beta thalassaemia mutations in Pakistani population plays a pivotal role in confirmation of borderline HbA2 thalassaemia carriers, specifically in areas with a high prevalence of the disease. Molecular testing for beta thalassaemia should be offered to all individuals with borderline HbA2 with values especially between 3.4‒3.9% and having microcytic hypochromic indices."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a genetic disease that is inherited in families and has been designated as a global burden. Individuals living with thalassemia may experience impacts on their psychosocial well-being. However, there is a gap of limited study at the systematic review level regarding the extent to which psychosocial aspects contribute to the overall problems and burdens experienced by people living with thalassemia. This study aimed to synthesize the evidence on psychosocial problems in people living with thalassemia to provide comprehensive insight. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was used to guide this systematic review. All relevant empirical studies in the English language that assessed the variety of psychosocial aspects were included. A total of 1,466 articles were identified from PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from those inceptions to 6 March 2023. 1,443 articles were excluded due to duplication, not thalassemia- or psychosocial-related, availability of full-text, and not including patients. Finally, 13 studies were included and assessed using Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) appraisal tools. This study is already registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023431082). This review analyzed 13 full-text studies conducted between 1993 and 2022. The MMAT quality assessment rated all 13 studies as high quality. The included studies used various designs, with six non-randomized quantitative studies, five descriptive quantitative studies, and two qualitative studies. The review summarizes each study's main findings, highlighting psychosocial problems and related outcomes, such as adherence and psychosocial morbidity, anxiety, educational and social impairment, coping style, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and adaptive behaviors and family relationships. The available literature globally highlights the psychosocial challenges of people living with thalassemia, particularly those who require regular blood transfusions across different timeframes. Despite inconsistent definitions across studies, it is notable that patients with thalassemia major facing physical changes associated with facial defects and experience significant psychosocial issues related to self-image, social interactions, and relationships that influence quality of life."

Gene editing technology introduced cis-acting elements, including NF-Y, KLF1, GATA1, and TAL1, into the regulatory region of <i>HBD</i>, successfully activating the expression of δ-globin. It was confirmed that the activation effect of δ-globin was closely related to the location of the introduced cis-acting elements. In this study, the mutation creates a de novo binding site for KLF1 at -85∼93 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the <i>HBD</i> gene, as well as the site for TAL1 and GATA1 cobinding motifs at -59 to ∼-78 bp, which could effectively activate δ-globin."

    "title": "Beyond blood transfusions: exploring iron chelation therapies in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Abnormal hemoglobin, or hemoglobinopathy, affects about 7% of the global population. Major hemoglobinopathies like beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease require regular blood transfusions, leading to chronic iron overload. This review examines the efficacy and safety of deferiprone, an oral iron chelator, in managing iron overload in pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent conditions. Data were sourced from PubMed, Google Scholar, and relevant articles, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2010 and 2023. The search terms included \"deferiprone,\" \"iron chelation,\" \"transfusion,\" \"iron overload,\" \"hemoglobinopathies,\" and \"thalassemia.\" Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria, involving 521 pediatric patients. The START trial demonstrated that early-start deferiprone significantly reduced iron load compared to placebo, with no severe adverse events. The DEEP-2 study found deferiprone non-inferior to deferasirox in terms of efficacy and safety. Another trial highlighted the benefits of early deferiprone therapy in delaying iron overload symptoms without serious side effects. Common adverse effects included pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and decreased neutrophil count, but no significant differences in growth parameters, creatinine, or prolactin levels were observed. Deferiprone shows significant promise in managing iron overload in pediatric patients, with comparable effectiveness to existing therapies and a favorable safety profile. Its oral administration is advantageous for young children. However, long-term studies are needed to fully understand its safety and efficacy. Addressing challenges such as patient compliance and adverse effects through education, personalized medicine, and advanced monitoring techniques can further improve treatment outcomes for beta-thalassemia patients."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) is one of the most common non-deletion types of alpha (α) thalassemia in Southeast Asia. The nature of this abnormal globin gene is unstable, labile, and present in minute amounts in the peripheral blood, leading to underdiagnosis. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Hb CS among the Kelantan population in Malaysia, compare the levels of Hb CS detected by capillary electrophoresis (CE) among three groups of Hb CS (heterozygous, homozygous, and compound heterozygous), and evaluate the efficacy of CE and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in detecting Hb CS. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data collected from secondary school students in Kelantan from 2017 to 2018 who participated in a thalassemia screening program conducted by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. Hb analysis was performed using an automated CE system (CAPILLARYS 2 Flex-Piercing System Sebia) and HPLC (VARIANT II, Bio-rad Laboratories). DNA analysis was used multiplex polymerase chain reaction and multiplex amplification refractory mutation system to detect deletion and non-deletion α-thalassemia. Termination codon CS mutation was confirmed among 376 (99.5%) samples with a peak value in zone 2 of CE. Heterozygous Hb CS was the most common type, detected in 344 samples (91.5%), followed by compound heterozygous Hb CS in 31 samples (8.2%) and one sample (0.3%) of homozygous Hb CS. The diagnosis of Hb CS is most accurately achieved by combining CE and HPLC methods, with confirmation by DNA molecular study, although the latter is more expensive."

A total of 98 children with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University between October 2022 and May 2023. The children were classified based on their hemoglobin (Hb) levels: 57 cases with Hb ≤ 90 g/L and 41 cases with Hb > 90 g/L. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was employed to assess the relative mRNA expression between the groups. The mRNA expression levels of FAM210B, HO-1, and NCOA4 were significantly higher in the Hb ≤ 90 g/L group compared to the Hb > 90 g/L group (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher relative expression levels of FAM210B and NCOA4 correlated with an increased likelihood of requiring blood transfusions in β-TM children. The differences in the remaining factors did not reach statistical significance. FAM210B and NCOA4 may serve as indicators of erythropoiesis and the degree of anemia in children with β-TM. Further research is warranted to explore their potential as therapeutic targets for β-thalassemia and other erythropoietic disorders."

    "abstract": "Life expectancy of patients with severe transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) remains below that of the general population. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the standard curative treatment. Due to the paucity of matched donor (MD) availability, haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) is a reasonable alternative. Twenty patients with TDT (median age 10 years; range 2-23) received either a matched sibling donor (MSD; n = 7) or a haplo-HSCT (n = 13) in a single center (Regensburg, Germany) between 2016 and 2022, including two patients referred for a haplo-HSCT as rescue failing prior MD- and haplo-HSCT, respectively. The conditioning regimen consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; Grafalon®), treosulfan, thiotepa, and fludarabine (FTT). Immunosuppression consisted of a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). At a median follow-up of 37 months (range 6-90), overall survival (OS) was 100% with a disease-free survival (DFS) of 100% in MSD and 92% in haplo-HSCT, respectively. Two patients in haplo-HSCT experienced graft failure, one achieving DFS after a second haplo-HSCT. No acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) ≥ °III or severe chronic GvHD (cGvHD) were observed. No sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) was observed in this high-risk population. Treosulfan-based T-cell depleted haplo-HSCT can achieve comparable OS and DFS even in young adult TDT patients with no SOS/VOD."

    "abstract": "Transfusion therapy is crucial for treating Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients. However, the production of Alloantibodies presents a substantial challenge for these individuals and impacts their quality of life. The Rh and Kell blood group antigens are particularly susceptible to alloantibody development. This study aims to establish the correlation between HLA-DRB1*04, HLA-DQB1*03, and HLA-DQB1*06 alleles and alloimmunzation in thalassemia patients from Iran. 98 thalassemic patients were recruited for this study (49 alloimmunized and 49 non-alloimmunized). Alloimmunized patients developed Rh and Kell specificities alloantibodies. The two groups were compared based on the results of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genotyping conducted using Sequence-Specific Primers (SSP-PCR). The findings from the antibody screening revealed that the predominant alloantibody detected was Anti-K (95.9%), Anti-E (65.3%), Anti-C (30.6%), Anti-D (28.6%), Anti-c (10.2%), Anti-e (2%), and Anti-k (2%). There was a notable difference in HLA-DQB1*03 between alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized groups, 41.8% vs. 58.2%, respectively. (iP = 0.001, OR = 0.135, CI = 0.036-0.499). There was not any notable relationship between HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DQB1*06 alleles and alloimmunization. Our findings indicate that HLA-DQB1*03 may have a protective role in preventing alloantibody production. Thus, HLA-typing, particularly focusing on DQB1*03, can significantly enhance the screening process, leading to improved blood transfusion management, reduced rejection of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and minimized blood transfusion complications."

    "abstract": "The transcription repressor BCL11A governs the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin during development. By targeting BCL11A, fetal hemoglobin expression can be de-repressed to substitute for defective adult hemoglobin in inherited diseases including beta-thalassemia and sickle-cell anemia. BCL11A has six CCHH-type zinc fingers, of which domains 4-6 are necessary and sufficient for dsDNA binding. Here, we focus on a putative ZNF at the N-terminus of BCL11A (residues 46-72), Z0, thought to modulate oligomerization of the transcription repressor. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy at low concentrations that favor the monomer, Z0 is shown to be a thermostable CCHC zinc finger with a pM dissociation constant for zinc. The NMR structure of Z0 has a prototypical beta-beta-alpha fold, with a hydrophobic knob comprising about half the structure. The unusual proportion of hydrophobic residues in Z0 led us to investigate if this is a more general feature of zinc fingers that do not bind dsDNA. We used the ZF and WebLogo servers to examine sequences of zinc fingers with demonstrated DNA-binding function, non-DNA-binders, and the CCHC-type family of protein-binders. DNA-binders are distinguished by contiguous stretches of high-scoring zinc fingers. Non-DNA-binders show a depletion of polar residues at the positions expected to contact nucleotides and increased sequence divergence, making these domains more likely to be annotated as atypical, degenerate, or to be missed as zinc fingers. We anticipate these sequence patterns will help distinguish DNA-binders from non-binders, an open problem in the functional understanding of zinc-finger motifs."

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and a lumbar spine Z-score <-2 was considered osteoporotic. Patients with osteoporosis were classified as Group 1 and those without osteoporosis as Group 2. <b>Results:</b> Osteoporosis was detected in 22.2% of the study population. The mean age was 13.83 ± 2.85 years in Group 1 and 7.95 ± 5.05 years in Group 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.012). Body weight and height were significantly lower in Group 1 (<i>p</i> = 0.012 and <i>p</i> = 0.004). Ferritin levels were 5306 ± 1506 ng/mL in Group 1 and 2020 ± 1205 ng/mL in Group 2, and the difference was significant (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Group 1 had significantly lower Ca and P levels (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.038). BMD was negatively correlated with ferritin (r = -0.791, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and positively correlated with calcium (r = 0.499, <i>p</i> = 0.008). <b>Conclusions</b>: Osteoporosis is a common condition in TM patients. Patients with risk factors should be followed more closely. These patients should be identified before BMD decreases. To prevent osteoporosis, regular BMD scans should be performed, calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be provided, and physical activity should be encouraged."

    "abstract": "Thrombosis is a significant complication in patients with β-thalassaemia/haemoglobin E (HbE), particularly in splenectomised patients. The endothelium is a key regulator of vascular haemostasis and homeostasis, through the secretion of various regulatory molecules. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by endothelial cells (ECs), regulates vascular functions by acting as a potent vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet activation. Decreased NO bioavailability, a marker of vascular dysfunction, could be a contributing factor leading to thrombosis. Microparticles or medium extracellular vesicles (mEVs) are associated with thrombosis and vasculopathy in various diseases. Furthermore, elevated levels of mEVs have been observed in splenectomised patients with β-thalassaemia/HbE and could induce the expression of coagulation proteins, inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules in ECs. However, the effects of mEVs on NO regulation by ECs is currently unclear. In the present study, mEVs obtained from splenectomised patients with β-thalassaemia/HbE had significantly decreased NO production in human pulmonary artery ECs without affecting endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression or phosphorylation. Decreased NO production was attributed to increased haemoglobin levels in mEVs from splenectomised patients, leading to enhanced NO scavenging. These findings highlight a mechanism whereby haemoglobin-carrying mEVs directly scavenge NO, contributing to vascular dysfunction in β-thalassaemia/HbE disease."

Peripheral blood samples were collected from 26 047 individuals seeking care at the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Reproductive Medicine, and Hematology across multiple regional hospitals in Guizhou Province, China. Thalassemia gene mutations were analyzed using targeted third-generation sequencing (TGS) to assess the mutation spectrum in this population. Of the cohort, 5099 individuals were identified as thalassemia carriers, yielding an overall carrier rate of 19.58%. The carrier rates differed significantly between the southern and northern regions of Guizhou (p < 0.001). α-thalassemia included 40 distinct genotypes, β-thalassemia comprised 33 genotypes, and cases with concurrent α- and β-thalassemia mutations exhibited 47 unique genotypes. A total of 17 distinct mutations were identified in the α-thalassemia gene and 26 in the β-thalassemia gene. The mutation spectrum in Guizhou showed significant differences when compared to other southern Chinese populations, with notable regional variations within Guizhou itself. This study highlights the substantial genetic diversity and distinct mutation patterns of thalassemia in Guizhou Province. These findings provide valuable insights into the distribution of thalassemia genotypes and alleles, which can inform genetic counseling and prenatal screening strategies tailored to this population."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin (Hb) F, or fetal hemoglobin, is the predominant Hb in fetuses and is converted to adult hemoglobin (Hb A) at the age of 2 years. However, high Hb F levels in adults are typically present in conditions such as β-thalassemia disease and high Hb F determinants including large deletional β-globin gene clusters, and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). The accurate detection of these conditions is crucial for effective disease management and genetic counseling. Several molecular techniques have been used to identify high Hb F determinants but require advanced instrumentation, highly skilled personnel, high cost, long time duration, and post-PCR processing. This study aimed to develop a rapid and cost-effective molecular assay for detecting common high Hb F determinants using colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with phenol red assays. We focused on the detection of HPFH6, Asian Indian inv-del (<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia, and Thai del-inv-ins (<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia. A total of 331 DNA samples encompassing 21 genotypes were screened using the developed LAMP assays, which were optimized to detect these determinants within 60-70 min. The assays showed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (99.6-100%) in each mutation with detection limits of 2.5 ng/reaction. Validation by comparison with conventional methods confirmed the efficacy of the LAMP assays, which is simple, inexpensive, and suitable for use in low-resource settings. Rapid performance, visual detection, and accurate diagnosis may be useful for genetic counseling, particularly in Thailand and Southeast Asia. This innovation is suitable for application in thalassemia screening programs, especially in remote areas."

The primary aim was to identify causes of death, comorbidities, treatment efficacy and iron overload prevalence. Of the deaths, 239 were attributed to thalassaemia and 96 to SCD. For thalassaemia patients, cardiac failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and sepsis were the leading causes of death, with no neoplasms observed in β+/β+ genotypes. In SCD, sepsis, liver failure and stroke were the predominant causes, with sepsis-related deaths higher in frequently transfused patients. The median age of death was significantly lower in thalassaemia (50 years) compared to SCD (58.49 years, p < 0.001). Differences in comorbidities and treatment effectiveness highlight the need for improved management strategies. Addressing iron overload, optimizing chelation therapy and expanding hydroxyurea use in SCD patients could enhance survival and quality of life.

The SUSTAIN study showed a reduction of vaso-occlusive crises in patients treated with 5 mg/kg crizanlizumab, compared with placebo. The STAND study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (5·0 mg/kg and 7·5 mg/kg) of crizanlizumab in sickle cell disease. Herein, we report the primary analysis results of STAND. STAND is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study of patients with sickle cell disease aged 12 years and older done at 65 sites in 21 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either 5·0 mg/kg of crizanlizumab, 7·5 mg/kg of crizanlizumab, or placebo, in addition to standard of care, for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the annualised rate of vaso-occlusive crises leading to a health-care visit over the first-year post-randomisation. The secondary objectives included assessing crizanlizumab's safety. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03814746) and is ongoing. Between July 26, 2019, and Aug 31, 2022, 252 patients were enrolled and treated. The primary analysis showed an adjusted annualised rate of vaso-occlusive crises of 2·49 (95% CI 1·90-3·26) in the crizanlizumab 5·0 mg/kg group, 2·04 (1·56-2·65) in the 7·5 mg/kg group, and 2·30 (1·75-3·01) in the placebo group. Ratios of adjusted annualised rates of vaso-occlusive crises leading to health-care visits were 1·08 (95% CI 0·76-1·55, p>0·999) for 5·0 mg/kg and 0·89 (0·62-1·27, p>0·999) for 7·5 mg/kg vs placebo. The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed less frequently in the placebo and crizanlizumab 7·5 mg/kg groups (27 [32%] of 85 and 32 [39%] of 83, respectively) than in the 5·0 mg/kg group (47 [56%] of 84). Serious adverse events (all grades) were also less frequent in the placebo and crizanlizumab 7·5 mg/kg groups (26 [31%] and 22 [27%], respectively) than in the 5·0 mg/kg group (35 [42%]). The STAND study supports the safety and tolerability of crizanlizumab in the treatment of sickle cell disease. The primary analysis showed no significant difference in efficacy between crizanlizumab and placebo. Factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, global enrolment with varied patterns of health-care use and vaso-occlusive crisis management as well as the commercial availability of crizanlizumab might have influenced these results. The safety profile of crizanlizumab was consistent with that in previous reports, without new safety concerns. Novartis Pharmaceuticals."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia (β-thal) is a worldwide hereditary red cell disorder characterized by severe chronic anemia. Recently, the pyruvate kinase (PK) activator mitapivat has been shown to improve anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis in a mouse model of β-thal and in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Here, we showed that in vitro CD34+-derived erythroblasts from patients with β-thal (codb039) are characterized by persistent expression of 2 PK isoforms, PKR and PKM2, compared with healthy cells. Activation of PKR and PKM2 via mitapivat promoted significant metabolic reprogramming of β-thal erythroblasts, resulting in higher levels of high-energy phosphate compounds, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and triphosphate nucleoside pools. Proteomics analyses revealed an accumulation of PKR, suggesting a possible beneficial effect of mitapivat on the stability of PKs. Increased ATP availability was accompanied by a higher degree of protein phosphorylation, especially in proteins involved in cell cycle regulation at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels, supporting the effect of mitapivat on erythroid maturation. Upon treatment with mitapivat, β-thal erythroblasts showed decreased markers of oxidation, including cysteine oxidative posttranslational modifications, downregulation of heat shock protein 70 and peroxiredoxin-2 expression, and normalization of the redox-dependent subcellular distribution of the latter enzyme. Collectively, our data support a protective effect of mitapivat in β-thal erythropoiesis, an effect favored by its activation of persistently expressed PKR and PKM2. In addition to the anticipated benefits on energy metabolism, we report that mitapivat treatment mitigated the oxidative damage in β-thal erythropoiesis, ensuring improved β-thal erythroblast maturation and survival."

In β-thalassemia minor (β-Tm), oxidative stress resulting from an unbalanced globin chain ratio has been documented, even in the absence of anemia and its complications. However, the status of oxidative stress-related DNA damage has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to assess DNA damage in β-Tm in a pediatric population. We compared 142 children with β-Tm to 113 healthy controls, including siblings of the β-Tm individuals. The comet assay was used to assess DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Additionally, oxidative stress markers and biochemical parameters were measured. No significant differences were observed between the β-Tm group and controls in terms of demographics, biochemical parameters, or baseline oxidative stress levels (p>0.05). In the comet assay, there was no difference in tail intensity (TI) between subjects and controls, nor between siblings with and without β-Tm (p=0.551 and p=0.655, respectively). However, when the β-Tm group was divided by age, a gradual increase in DNA damage, as measured by TI, was observed. This increase was more pronounced in the β-Tm group compared to controls. We observed no significant differences in DNA damage between β-Tm individuals and controls. However, TI increased at a faster rate with age in carriers compared to non-carriers, suggesting that environmental factors might exert a more pronounced influence on the genetic integrity of individuals with a β-Tm background. Although β-Tm itself does not seem to pose a substantial genotoxic risk in childhood, our findings underscore the importance of further research into the interplay between β-Tm and other risk factors throughout life. We advocate for long-term monitoring of β-Tm children to assess the health and potential genetic consequences."

    "title": "Prevalence of Hemoglobinopathies Among the Kurdish Population in Zakho City, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies are the most common inherited disorders in the Mediterranean region, including Iraq, with different frequencies and molecular features. They represent an important health problem in Iraq. Several studies have addressed the prevalence of hemoglobinopathy in Iraq, but no specific research has addressed its prevalence in Zakho city, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. Thus, this study was conducted to address this issue. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a premarital screening center at Zakho Emergency Teaching Hospital, involving 11,910 Kurdish persons attending premarital screening investigations. Blood samples were collected from all participants for complete blood counts and sickling tests. A cut-off value of hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (<13.0 gm/dl in males, <12.0 gm/dl in females), mean cell volume (MCV) <80 fl and/or mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) <27 pg, and the results of the sickling test were used to categorize the participants into three groups: group I, normal (normal Hb, MCV, and MCH, and negative sickling test); group II, individuals with MCV < 80 fl and/or MCH < 27 pg, with or without anemia, and negative sickling test; group III, sickle positive (individuals with a positive sickling test, with or without anemia, regardless of MCV and/or MCH values). Groups II and III underwent further evaluations by morphology, reticulocyte count, hemoglobin-H preparation, iron studies, and cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). β-thalassemia trait was diagnosed by hypochromic microcytic red cell indices and increased hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) (>3.5%). The sickle cell trait was diagnosed by the presence of a band at the S region at HPLC with a positive sickling test. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was diagnosed by hypochromic microcytic anemia and reduced transferrin saturation (<15%) and/or ferritin (<15 mg/L). Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to define significant differences between the study's findings. A total of 963 (8.09%) of the studied participants were in group II. Further investigations on these 963 cases confirmed a diagnosis of IDA in 610 (5.12%). β-thalassemia trait was detected in 308 cases, with an overall prevalence of 2.59%. δβ-thalassemia trait was detected in nine (0.076%) of the studied participants. A professional diagnosis of α-thalassemia was given to 36 (0.30%) of those with hypochromic microcytic red cell indices, normal iron studies, and HPLC results. A positive sickling test was seen in 48 participants and confirmed by HPLC as a sickle cell trait with a prevalence of 0.4%. The consanguinity rate among couples was 28.8%. Neither case of HbC or HbD trait, nor combined hemoglobinopathy, was detected in the current study. Furthermore, no differences were found between the prevalence of both β thalassemia and sickle cell trait with either sex and/or religion, with a p-value of 0.07, 0.07, 0.532, and 0.78, respectively. The prevalence of hemoglobinopathy in Zakho city is lower than in other regions of Iraq but still constitutes a significant burden on health services and financial resources. Careful interpretations of red cell indices, together with intensified premarital screening and counseling programs, coupled with an urgent need to increase awareness about the effects of consanguinity marriages on the prevalence of autosomal recessive disorders, can further reduce the incidence of hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains associated with reduced life expectancy and poor quality of life despite improvements observed in the last decades mostly related to comprehensive care, use of hydroxycarbamide, screening to identify patients at risk of strokes, and implementation of safe transfusion protocols. The course of the disease is highly variable, making it difficult to predict severity and response to therapy. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation potentially provides a cure with a relatively low rate of complications, but few patients have an HLA-identical sibling. The hopes of patients and healthcare providers have been raised after the initial excellent results of gene therapy studies. However, there is a strong contrast between the high expectations of families and patients and the limited availability of the product, which is technically complex and very expensive. In light of this consideration and of the limited data available on the long-term efficacy and toxicity of different gene therapy approaches, the European Hematology Association Red Cell & Iron Specialized Working Group (EHA SWG) and the hemoglobinopathy working part of the European Blood & Marrow Transplant (EBMT) Group have prioritized the development of recommendations for selection of patients with SCD who are good candidates for gene therapy. The decision-making algorithm was developed by a panel of experts in hemoglobinopathies and/or transplantation chosen by EHA SWG and EBMT, to discuss the selection of SCD patients for gene therapy and draw notes on the related clinical problems."

    "abstract": "To determine the carrier frequency of X-linked and autosomal recessive diseases in patients attending a human fertility institute in Colombia. This retrospective observational study included patients and gamete donors attending a Human Fertility Institute in Colombia between January 2017 and June 2023. Sociodemographic data and results of Next Generation Sequencing laboratory panels for screening of recessive disease-causing mutations were collected and analyzed. Data from 746 samples were analyzed; 599 (80.3%) were Colombian origin individuals and 147 (19.7%) were foreigners. At least one mutation was detected in 526 (70.5%) individuals. Of note, 893 pathogenic genetic variants were identified.The genetic variants most frequently observed in all the individuals studied were associated with the following diseases (carrier frequency): alpha thalassemia (10.5%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (10%), congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (9.4%), cystic fibrosis (7.3%), spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (5.6%) and Stargardt disease type 1 (5.0%). The most frequent genetic variant observed in the subgroup of Colombian origin individuals was associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (11.3%). Information on the frequency of recessive diseases in Colombia is limited. This pioneering carrier genetic screening identified a high percentage of carriers for at least one recessive autosomal or X-linked in the population evaluated. Screening for recessive mutations could lead to an evolution in family planning programs and a decrease in the number of patients affected by recessive disorders. Furthermore, it could become a routine test not only in cases of assisted reproduction but also in cases of natural gestation."

Despite its growing recognition, gaps remain in the literature regarding the clinical applications of oculomics. Various systemic diseases-including metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus), infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., dementia), hematologic disorders (e.g., thalassemia), autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and genetic syndromes (e.g., Fabry disease)-exhibit ocular manifestations detectable through in vivo confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography, among other imaging modalities. Increasing evidence supports the role of corneal imaging in identifying systemic disease biomarkers, a process further enhanced by artificial intelligence-driven analyses. This review synthesizes the current findings on corneal biomarkers of systemic disease, their ophthalmic imaging correlates, and the expanding role of corneal oculomics in translational medicine. Additionally, we explore future directions for integrating oculomics into clinical practice and biomedical research."

The pancreatic volume and pancreatic and hepatic iron levels were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging. <b>Results:</b> The pancreatic volume indexed by body surface area (PVI) was significantly lower in both β-TI and β-TM patients compared to healthy subjects and in β-TM patients compared to β-TI patients. The only independent determinants of PVI were pancreatic iron in β-TM and hepatic iron in β-TI. In β-TM, there was an association between alterations of glucose metabolism and PVI, and PVI was a comparable predictor of altered glucose metabolism compared to pancreatic iron. Only one β-TI patient had an altered glucose metabolism and showed a reduced PVI and pancreatic iron overload. <b>Conclusions:</b> Thalassemia syndromes are characterized by a reduced pancreatic volume, associated with iron levels. In β-TM, the pancreatic volume and iron deposition are associated with the development and progression of alterations of glucose metabolism."

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied for carrier screening, effectively reducing the incidence of severe diseases. However, some severe, high-prevalent and complex diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), α-/β-thalassemia, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), and fragile-X syndrome (FXS), cannot be fully addressed by NGS, resulting in a high residual risk ratio. This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility of a long-read sequencing (LRS) panel for carrier screening of these five complex diseases. A total of 2926 participants were retrospectively enrolled from International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital from Jan 2019 to Dec 2022. All the participants were previously screened for 149 genes correlated to 147 diseases by NGS. The samples were collected and analyzed with the LRS panel targeting the five complex diseases. LRS identified 236 carrier variants, including 54 for SMA, 113 for α-thalassemia, 19 for β-thalassemia, 47 for 21-OHD, and three for FXS. NGS identified only 56.4% (133/236) of the variants detected by LRS. NGS failed to detect three SMA carriers with SMN1 intragenic variants, while reported 10 false-positive carriers for α-thalassemia (HKαα miscalled as -α3.7). Both 21-OHD and FXS were beyond its detection scope. NGS identified only three of the seven at-risk couples determined by LRS. The total estimated at-risk couple rate for 151 genes in NGS and LRS panels was 1.0996%. SMA, α-/β-thalassemia, 21-OHD, and FXS were among the top 30 high-prevalent diseases and had a combined at-risk couple rate of 0.2433%, accounting for 22.1% of the total ratio. NGS could only identify 22.7% of the at-risk couples for the five diseases in the LRS panel. Comprehensive carrier screening for high-prevalent diseases had higher clinical utility than expanding the list of low-prevalent diseases. Incorporating LRS into the NGS carrier screening strategy would facilitate more effective carrier screening."

    "abstract": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for long-term (L) and transient (T) calcium channels (LTCC and TTCC) on cardiomyocytes have been suggested to manage iron-induced cardiomyopathy in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. However, the results of clinical trials on the effectiveness of CCBs have been conflicting. Here, we systematically reviewed previous studies to investigate the potential factors that could act as therapeutic modifiers and explain these discrepancies. This systematic review was conducted employing the PRISMA guideline to retrieve clinical trials and animal studies investigating the efficacy of CCBs. Studies in the following databases were collected: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinical Trials, Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Keywords included the trade and generic names of various CCBs, thalassemia, and cardiomyopathy. Our Primary search resulted in 297 studies, of which 21 (n = 7 trials and n = 14 animal studies) were further analyzed. The most important parameters that could potentially influence the clinical effectiveness of CCBs in managing iron-induced cardiomyopathy included baseline cardiac iron content, diversity of iron entry routes (LTCCs, TTCCs, DMT-1, etc.), type of CCBs used, iron-induced irreversible functional/structural cardiac changes, iron-Ca<sup>2+</sup> joint metabolic dysregulation, deregulated expression of LTCCs and TTCCs, interaction of CCBs with iron chelators, disease-related complications, interactions of CCBs with various supplements used by patients, vitamin D and other nutrient deficiencies, and duration of treatment with CCBs. These items should be considered in future trials to draw more robust conclusions about the effectiveness of CCBs in preventing cardiac iron deposition and associated cardiomyopathy in TDT patients."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia are important health problems in Middle Eastern countries. Transfusion is the cornerstone of the management in these disorders, and red blood cell alloimmunization is among the well-recognized adverse effects associated with it. We reviewed the literature on published studies on alloimmunization prevalence, its associated risk factors, and transfusion policies employed in these countries. Our review included 39 studies on thalassemia (including 9005 patients), and 19 on sickle cell disease (including 3867 patients). The mean alloimmunization prevalence rate in thalassemia was 13.0% (95% CI: 10.0-15.0%), while that in sickle cell disease was 14.0% (95% CI: 10.0 - 19.0%). The distribution of the prevalence rates showed considerable heterogeneity in both diseases. The most frequent alloantibodies detected were anti-K (25.9%), Anti-E (21.8%), and Anti-D (9.2%), with Rhesus and K antibodies comprising 74.2% of all antibodies detected. Some risk factors were significant in several studies, including older age, female sex, older age at first transfusion, number of transfused units, and splenectomy. The prevalence of alloimmunization was significantly higher in retrospective studies compared to cross-sectional ones, in both thalassemia and sickle cell disease (<i>P</i> = 0.04 in each). This review reaffirmed the need to provide ABO+Rhesus + K matched blood to hemoglobinopathy patients in the Middle East, and the need for more research on Rhesus variants in this part of the world."

However, there is a scarcity of data regarding the prevalence of RBC alloimmunization in such patients in Saudi Arabia. To address this gap, a comprehensive meta-analysis was undertaken to ascertain the rate of RBC alloimmunization in SCD and thalassemia patients who receive regular transfusions in Saudi Arabia. A systematic search and subsequent meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines, were carried out. We meticulously combed through six prominent scientific databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, up to July 20, 2023, to identify pertinent English-language articles. Data were meticulously extracted from the selected studies. The meta-analysis adopted a random-effects model and included subgroup analyses to delineate the RBC alloimmunization rates specifically for SCD and thalassemia patients receiving regular transfusions. Heterogeneity was assessed through Cochran's Q and I2 tests. The study protocol was registered under PROSPERO, with the code CRD42023440761. Our comprehensive search yielded a total of 983 articles, with 12 meeting the criteria for the final analysis, encompassing a total of 1,811 SCD and thalassemia patients. The collective RBC alloimmunization rate across all the eligible articles for patients with SCD and thalassemia who received regular transfusions in Saudi Arabia was determined to be 18.2%. Subgroup analysis, comprising nine articles, indicated that the RBC alloimmunization rate among SCD patients was 18.6%, while analysis of six articles revealed that the rate among thalassemia patients stood at 19.5%. This meta-analysis underscores that the RBC alloimmunization rate in SCD and thalassemia patients who regularly receive transfusions in Saudi Arabia stands at 18.2%. Considering these findings, it is essential to prioritize extended phenotyping prior to transfusion to significantly reduce the risk of RBC alloimmunization."

    "abstract": "Iron overload cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. Standard iron chelation therapy is less efficient in alleviating iron accumulation in many organs, especially when iron enters the cells <i>via</i> specific calcium channels. To validate our hypothesis that adding amlodipine to the iron chelation regimen is more efficient in alleviating myocardial iron overload. Five databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, ScienceDirect, and ClinicalTrials.gov, were systematically searched, and three randomized controlled trials involving 144 pediatric patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia were included in our meta-analysis based on the predefined eligibility criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed based on the Cochrane collaboration tool for bias assessment. The primary outcome assessed was myocardial-T2 and myocardial iron concentration, while the secondary results showed serum ferritin level, liver iron concentration, and treatment adverse outcomes. Weighted mean difference and odds ratio were calculated to measure the changes in the estimated treatment effects. During the follow-up period, Amlodipine treatment significantly improved cardiac T2 by 2.79 ms compared to the control group [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-5.24, <i>P</i> = 0.03, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%]. Additionally, a significant reduction of 0.31 in myocardial iron concentration was observed with amlodipine treatment compared to the control group [95%CI: -0.38-(-0.25), <i>P</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%]. Liver iron concentration was slightly lower in the amlodipine group by -0.04 mg/g, but this difference was not statistically significant (95%CI: -0.33-0.24, <i>P</i> = 0.77, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%). Amlodipine also showed a non-significant trend toward a reduction in serum ferritin levels (-328.86 ng/mL, 95%CI: -1212.34-554.62, <i>P</i> = 0.47, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 90%). Regarding safety, there were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of gastrointestinal upset, hypotension, or lower limb edema. Amlodipine with iron chelation therapy significantly improved cardiac parameters, including cardiac-T2 and myocardial iron, in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia without causing significant adverse events but enhancing the efficacy of iron chelation therapy."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) are inherited blood disorders caused by pathogenic variants of the β-globin gene. Historically, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors has been the only curative option. However, as most patients with SCD or TDT lack HLA-matched donors, autologous or patient-derived HSCT can provide an alternative, transformative option. Gene therapy-based autologous HSCT for the treatment of SCD and TDT entails a complex patient journey and requires the careful implementation of numerous policies and procedures. As gene therapies for these diseases are now commercially available, there is great value in institutions with developed and implemented approaches sharing their best practices. Here, we describe standardized approaches and best practices for the optimized implementation of gene therapies based on our experience in administering this novel class of medicines."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin disorders are a considerable public health issue with more than 500 000 affected infants born annually worldwide. First introduced in the 1970s, newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease (SCD) was included in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2006, a successful public health promotion and prevention practice that has led to improved childhood survival. Although SCD is the primary target, the screening process also detects many other hemoglobinopathies. NBS programs, administered by individual states, vary in their practices for hemoglobinopathy screening, creating health inequities and compromising public health efforts. There is a lack of uniformity in the choice of primary screening test, reporting, and follow-up of abnormal results, exacerbated by inconsistent access to genetic confirmation. Consequently, newborns diagnosed through protein-based screening alone may have diverse genotypes that alter the clinical expression of hemoglobinopathies. This Special Communication considers how the universal adoption of molecular testing for hemoglobinopathy newborn screening can overcome these current shortcomings. Simultaneously, the considerable challenges of primary screening with molecular methods and how these can be overcome are evaluated. Screening with targeted genetic testing of the hemoglobin genes (HbA1, HBA2, HBB) is especially well suited to hemoglobinopathies because there exists an extensive database of variants for the prediction of pathogenicity, averting the need for secondary or multiple testing. Importantly, it would eliminate the health disparities created by location and health insurance on the access to confirmatory testing and facilitate timely referral for definitive care. Standardization of the screening platform with diagnostic specificity has vast implications for public health surveillance and resource allocation. The adoption of molecular testing requires bringing new technology online, training and changes to workflow, potentially increased cost, and concerns for genetic data protection. Some of these barriers can be overcome using high-throughput methods with the potential to multiplex with other disease conditions that use genetic testing for primary screening through the consolidation of platforms. The time has come for a paradigm shift in newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies through the adoption of universal molecular genetic testing."

There are few studies on the prevalence and genotype of thalassemia in different ethnic groups of infertility patients in Hainan province. The aim of our study was to explore the prevalence and genotype of thalassemia among infertile individuals in Hainan Province. Thalassemia genotypes were determined using gap-PCR and PCR-RBD in 13,856 infertile individuals in our study. Among them, 3458 (24.96%) were diagnosed as thalassemia carriers. In Li ethnic group, 649 (75.12%) were diagnosed as thalassemia carriers, which significantly higher than Han (21.62%) and other ethnicities (22.09%). As the molecular spectrum of thalassemia, the most common α-thalassemia genotype among Han and other ethnicities was -α<sup>3.7</sup>/αα, while among Li ethnic group was -α<sup>4.2</sup>/αα. For β-thalassemia, the most common genotype among Han and Li ethnic groups was β<sup>41-42 M</sup>/βN, while both β<sup>41-42 M</sup>/βN and β<sup>17M</sup>/βN were common genotype in other ethnic groups.

    "abstract": "To investigate the ongoing parvovirus B19 (B19V) outbreak among pregnant women in Germany and its connection to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This retrospective cohort study analyzed anonymous data regarding serologically confirmed B19V infections during pregnancy between January 2014 and April 2024 across 13 major fetal medicine centers in Germany. We evaluated the yearly frequency of B19V cases, cases that underwent intrauterine transfusion (IUT), cases presenting with hydrops fetalis and cases of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) related to B19V infection, and stratified these variables by event occurrence < 20 weeks' gestation or ≥ 20 weeks' gestation. Variables were compared across three subperiods: pre COVID-19 pandemic, during the COVID-19 pandemic and post COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 918 pregnant women with confirmed B19V infection revealed a significant B19V outbreak since the end of 2023. The mean ± SD number of annual cases was 57.3 ± 20.7 pre COVID-19, 20.3 ± 13.5 during COVID-19 and surged to 384.8 ± 299.8 post COVID-19 (P < 0.01). Correspondingly, the number of cases in which the fetus underwent IUT increased post COVID-19. The proportion of B19V diagnoses made before 20 weeks' gestation increased from 32.3% pre COVID-19 to 53.2% post COVID-19 (P < 0.001). These results demonstrate an unforeseen increase in B19V infections during pregnancy after the COVID-19 pandemic, with a consequent rise in B19V cases with fetal anemia. The introduced policies during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the B19V infection rate but likely conditioned the present ongoing upsurge. Counseling, early detection and access to specialized centers performing IUT are essential measures required to address this outbreak. © 2025 The Author(s).

For α-globin haplotype analysis, 110 subjects with normal α-globin and 232 subjects with α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia were selected to analyze six polymorphic sites using the PCR-RFLP technique. For VNTR loci analysis, 447 subjects were examined for D1S80, D17S5, and TPO allele frequencies using a PCR-based method. The results of this study revealed that the most frequent haplotypes found in Laos, including (framework 1; + M - + - 0) linked to (-α<sup>3.7</sup>) and (framework 3; - S - + + -) related to (α<sup>CS</sup>α) were different from those found in Khmer and Kui [(framework 2; + S - + - 0) linked to (-α<sup>3.7</sup>) and (framework 1; + M - + + -) related to (α<sup>CS</sup>α)]. For the (α<sup>PS</sup>α) gene, the haplotype (+ S - + - -) of framework 2 was found in all ethnic groups, and the haplotype (- M - + + -) of framework 1 in the Yer only. The distribution of allele frequencies for the D1S80, D17S5, and TPO VNTR loci showed extensive genetic variation in the ethnic population studied. The number of alleles is higher than that of the previously reported populations. Based on D17S5 analysis, the phylogenetic tree suggested that Khmer and Kui ethnic groups had a close relationship but were distant from Laos. In addition, ethnic relationships were observed in the Yer and Kui populations. In contrast, consistent results were not obtained based on D1S80 and TPO analysis. The findings indicate genetic variation in these ethnic populations, but the conclusion remains tentative. However, this study provides useful information to better understand genetic origins and ethnic relationships in the region."

    "title": "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Measured by Immulite 1000 and Elecsys Assay Platforms in Suspected Cases of Hypocortisolism: A Word of Caution.",
    "abstract": "Several reports suggested that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level measured by Immulite 1000 may be falsely elevated leading to misdiagnosis of etiology of Cushing syndrome. However, when it comes to fallacies of ACTH measurement in suspected cases of hypocortisolism, evidence is limited. We explored the performance of ACTH assays using Immulite 1000 and Elecsys Cobas immunoassay platforms in subjects with hypocortisolism. In this observational, cross-sectional study, 104 patients with haemoglobin E/beta-thalassemia were subjected to 9 am serum cortisol, direct renin concentration, and plasma aldosterone. Plasma ACTH was measured in Immulite 1000 and Elecsys Cobas platforms. Both 1 μg and 250 μg Synacthen stimulation tests were performed to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Among 104 patients with haemoglobin E/beta-thalassemia, 34 had primary adrenal insufficiency, 9 had secondary adrenal insufficiency, and 33 had subclinical adrenal insufficiency. Mean plasma ACTH (n = 104) measured by Immulite 1000 and Elecsys was 83.42 ± 63.46 pg/mL versus 52.10 ± 38.14 pg/mL, respectively (P < .001). The values had good correlation (r = 0.341, P < .001); however, the agreement between measured values was not strong (Cohen's κ = 0.208, P = .001). With regard to the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency, specificity of Immulite 1000 was low compared with Elecsys (27.86% vs 80.32%). Furthermore, 2 patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency had inappropriately elevated ACTH measured at Immulite 1000 assay platform. Use of Immulite 1000 platform may result in falsely elevated ACTH values. Physicians should exercise caution while interpreting the results and repeat test using a different assay platform may be considered."

    "title": "Macrophages in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): dual roles as therapeutic tools and targets.",
    "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease remains one of the most formidable barriers to the complete success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that has emerged as the curative approach for many hematopoietic malignancies because it affects quality of life and overall survival. Macrophages are among the important members of the immune system, which perform dual roles in GVHD as both therapeutic tools and targets. This review epitomizes the multifunctional role of macrophages in the pathophysiology of both acute and chronic GVHD. Macrophages play an important role in the early phase of GVHD because of their recruitment and infiltration into target organs. Furthermore, they polarize into two functionally different phenotypes, including M1 and M2. In the case of acute GVHD, most macrophages express the M1 phenotype characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to tissue damage. In contrast, in chronic GVHD, macrophages tend toward the M2 phenotype associated with the repair of tissues and fibrosis. A critical balance among these phenotypes is central to the course and severity of GVHD. Further interactions of macrophages with other lymphocytes such as T cells, B cells, and fibroblast further determine the course of GVHD. Macrophage interaction associated with alloreactive T cells promotes inflammation. This is therefore important in inducing injuries of tissues during acute GVHD. Interaction of macrophages, B cell, fibroblast, and CD4+ T cells promotes fibrosis during chronic GVHD and, hence, the subsequent dysfunction of organs. These are some insights, while several challenges remain. First, the impact of the dominant cytokines in GVHD on the polarization of macrophages is incompletely characterized and sometimes controversial. Second, the development of targeted therapies able to modulate macrophage function without systemic side effects remains an area of ongoing investigation. Future directions involve the exploration of macrophage-targeted therapies, including small molecules, antibodies, and nanotechnology, which modulate macrophage behavior and improve patient outcomes. This underlines the fact that a profound understanding of the dual role of macrophages in GVHD is essential for developing new and more effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting macrophages might represent one avenue for decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD and improving the success and safety of HSCT."

    "abstract": "Various critical medical procedures would become impossible without blood donations-saving lives in emergencies, surgeries, and chronic conditions like thalassemia. Therefore, it seems crucial to enhance donor recruitment and ensure blood supply. For this, we rate donor motivations and explore associations between donors' engagement with marketing stimuli and willingness to participate in donor recruitment. To help design tailored marketing strategies, this study examines age-specific social media preferences for promoting blood donation. To reach these objectives, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with 907 donors at Israeli blood-donation centers. Data on donation motivations, social media preferences, and willingness to recruit others were collected through a structured questionnaire. The leading motivators for blood donation were solidarity and marketing stimuli. The results also revealed a significant association between donors' engagement with marketing stimuli and willingness to encourage others to donate blood. The channel preferred by donors of all age groups for promoting blood donation content was WhatsApp. The choice of other social media varied significantly by age. While younger donors (18-30) favored Instagram, other donor age groups (31-50; 51+) preferred Facebook. Based on average values, the most popular social media for promoting blood donation content were WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. Insights from this research can support blood collection agencies in refining marketing strategies for donor recruitment. For maximizing the reach of recruitment efforts, it seems essential to use various social media based on donors' age groups."

LGMD R8 is featured by high genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity, most pathogenic variants are missense variants located in the NHL domain, but the genotype-phenotype correlation remains unclear. We hypothesized that various missense variants in NHL domain might have different degrees of impact on the structure and function of the protein, thus resulting in disease variability. Firstly, by analyzing present patients' clinical data, we screen out 4 variants: R394H, D487N, V591M and P619S. Patients homozygous for the aforementioned variants exhibited significant phenotypic variability, including variations in age of onset and age of any walking aid (AWA). Then, bioinformatics analysis, cellular functional experiment and biophysical assay were used to measure the effect of above variants in TRIM32 protein oligomerization and ubiquitination to target substrates. And they revealed distinct differences in the intrinsic E3 ligase activity among various mutant TRIM32 proteins, which corresponded to differences in their oligomerization status. In conclusion, our results showed a correlation between clinical severity, protein function and oligomerization state in patients homozygous for missense variants in NHL domain. It is the first time to reveal a connection between TRIM32 variant with LGMD R8 phenotype and this finding provided valuable reference in predicting disease severity and more precise guidance to affected family on genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that affects many people worldwide. Although treatments such as iron chelation and safe transfusions have improved life expectancy, patients still experience complications. Thalidomide, with its immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties, has been found to increase the expression of the γ-globin gene and promote erythroid cell proliferation. Our study compared thalidomide-treated and standard therapy groups, assessing health-related quality of life in thalassemia patients using the SF-36 questionnaire tailored for the Indian population. A total of 84 patients (Thalidomide: 50, Standard: 34) were enrolled. Sixty-four percent of patients on thalidomide became transfusion-free within 4-6 months. The mean duration of transfusion requirement in the thalidomide group increased from 20 to 35 days in 30% of patients. Patients aged ≤ 20 years, without splenectomy, and unemployed had significantly better physical health component (PHC) scores with thalidomide therapy compared to standard therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.027, <i>P</i> = 0.0007, and <i>P</i> = 0.045, respectively). On the other hand, patients aged >20 years and with intact spleen had significantly better mental health component (MHC) scores with thalidomide therapy compared to standard therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.006 and <i>P</i> < 0.00001, respectively). Thalidomide therapy showed significantly better MHC scores than standard therapy on all four scales. Thalidomide therapy shows significant promise in improving the HRQoL for thalassemia patients, particularly in those with early initiation, as indicated by enhanced physical and mental health component scores and improved vitality, emotional well-being, role-emotional, and social functioning compared to standard care."

    "abstract": "Alpha thalassemia major (ATM) is the most severe form of α-thalassemia, with thousands of cases annually throughout the world. It was historically incompatible with life, with almost all affected individuals dying at or before birth. Recent advances utilizing early, serial intrauterine transfusions have resulted in improved outcomes, including improved neurocognitive functioning and less congenital anomalies. At-risk families should be identified pre-conceptually for counseling and options such as preimplantation genetic testing. ATM, when diagnosed prenatally, requires counseling about termination options and transfusion therapy. Postnatally, aggressive transfusion, in contrast to standard thalassemia transfusion protocols, suppresses ineffective erythropoiesis and hemoglobin Barts formation. These advances have changed the course of ATM <i>in utero</i> and postnatally. Preliminary results suggest iron chelation may be safely administered after one year of age with monitoring, including quantitative liver iron measurements. Patients with ATM can now survive on chronic transfusion therapy and potentially be cured by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). New therapies continue to emerge, including <i>in-utero</i> stem cell transplantation using maternal stem cells and Phase 1 gene therapy trials evaluating reactivation of the embryonic α-globin (zeta) gene and encoding the α-globin gene. Globally, an international working group has been formed to address ATM, which should lead to advances worldwide."

Zinc deficiency can impair growth, cause atopic dermatitis, and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections, while vitamin D deficiency disrupts bone mineralization and metabolism. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of zinc and vitamin D deficiencies and investigate associated factors in pediatric to young adult NTDT patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Chiang Mai University Hospital, enrolling NTDT patients aged 5 to 25 years who received fewer than three transfusions annually. Serum zinc and vitamin D levels were measured. Patients and parents completed a 3-day food diary and a sun exposure questionnaire. Zinc deficiency was defined as levels below the reference level for age. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as levels <20 ng/mL. Clinical and hematologic parameters were compared between groups with and without deficiencies. Forty-five patients with NTDT were enrolled, including 23 males (51.1%) males, with a mean age of 12.8 ± 5.3 years. Zinc deficiency affected 13 patients (28.9%), while 23 patients (51.1%) had vitamin D deficiency. Thinness was observed more frequently in patients with zinc deficiency. However, this finding did not reach statistical significance. Older age and inadequate sun exposure were associated with vitamin D deficiency. This study underscores a high prevalence of zinc and vitamin D deficiencies in pediatric and young adult NTDT patients and identifies the associated factors. Addressing and monitoring these deficiencies are crucial for optimizing long-term health outcomes in this patient group."

The relative expression of the genes was determined using the Real-time PCR method. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. When the DR cells were compared to the DS cells, there was a notable increase in the expression of <i>ULK1</i> and <i>LC3B</i>. However, expression of <i>P62</i> in the DR plasma cells showed a significant decrease compared to the DS plasma cells. The <i>miR-1297</i> level was considerably higher in the DR cells than in the DS cells. Although, there was no statistically significant difference in the expression of <i>miR-26a-5p</i> between the DS and DR cells. The DR cells exhibited a statistically significant increase in the expression of <i>MALAT1</i> and <i>SNHG6</i>.

Identifying reliable biomarkers for early prediction of aGVHD could enable timely interventions and improve patient outcomes. This study aims to assess whether levels of specific cytokines can serve as predictive markers for the onset and severity of aGVHD. Plasma levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, sST2, CD25, and REG3α were measured via ELISA in 50 allo-HSCT patients (20 with aGVHD and 30 without aGVHD) on Days +7, +14, and +21 post - transplantation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were used to assess the predictive performance of these biomarkers. Among the six biomarkers analyzed, sST2 demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for aGVHD. Elevated sST2 levels at Days +14 and +21 posttransplantation significantly correlated with aGVHD occurrence (AUC = 0.7092 at Day +21) and gastrointestinal aGVHD (AUC = 0.8007 at Day +14). sST2 also showed strong predictive performance for severe aGVHD (Grade II-IV), with AUC values of 0.8125 at Day +7 and 0.8021 at Day +14. Other biomarkers, including IL-6, REG3α, CD25, and TNF-α, exhibited dynamic changes but lacked robust predictive value for aGVHD onset or severity. These findings support sST2 as a promising biomarker for early risk stratification of aGVHD. SST2 is a promising biomarker for the early prediction of aGVHD, offering potential for guiding proactive therapeutic strategies in allo-HSCT patients."

The deletions of α-thalassemia mutation by gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR), and the non-deletion α-thalassemia mutations and β-thalassemia mutations were detected by reverse dot-blot hybridization (RDB-PCR). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was utilized to analyze the diagnostic value of HbA2 for pregnant women's thalassemia. A total of 656 carriers were detected in 3243 pregnant women with suspected thalassemia carriers, with a positive detection rate of about 20.22%. 459 cases were defined to be α-thalassemia, with the main type of <sub>--</sub><sup>SEA</sup>/αα (47.71%). 170 cases were defined to be β-thalassemia, with the main type of β<sup>CD41-42</sup>/β<sup>N</sup> (31.76%). 27 genotypes of αβ-thalassemia were noted in pregnant women. There was significant difference of HbA2 level between the pregnant women with different types of thalassemia and healthy controls (all P < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising source of molecular biomarkers in the detection and monitoring of brain malignancies. Unlike peripheral blood, where biomarker detection is hindered by the blood-brain barrier and the complex nature of biofluids, CSF offers a more direct and enriched source of tumor-derived markers, including circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA), proteins, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). These biomarkers, originating from brain tumor cells, are often more concentrated in CSF than in peripheral blood due to the proximity of CSF to the central nervous system (CNS). The presence of ctDNA in CSF is notably higher than in plasma, making CSF an advantageous medium for liquid biopsy in brain tumor patients. Traditional liquid biopsy approaches relying on peripheral venous blood samples often face challenges in detecting low concentrations of tumor-derived biomarkers. The direct contact of CSF with the CNS minimizes background noise, potentially enhancing the accuracy and sensitivity of diagnostic assays. Despite the barriers posed by the blood-brain barrier and other physiological factors that limit biomarker levels in the systemic circulation, CSF's unique position within the CNS allows for more effective biomarker collection. While peripheral blood remains the standard medium for liquid biopsy in oncology, the proximity of CSF to brain tumors suggests it may offer superior diagnostic capabilities. Emerging evidence from non-CNS malignancies indicates that collecting biofluids closer to the tumor site can significantly improve biomarker detection. Although this approach has been well-documented in other solid tumors, its application to CNS malignancies remains underexplored. This study hypothesizes that targeted blood sampling from CNS tumor-draining veins could similarly enhance biomarker detection, thereby increasing the sensitivity and efficacy of liquid biopsy techniques in diagnosing and monitoring brain malignancies."

    "abstract": "More than 1,800 changes in the synthesis and structure of hemoglobin (Hb) are estimated to exist. Many of them can be identified by chromatographic and electrophoretic analyses. However, in some cases, critical interpretation, accompanied by molecular techniques and gene sequencing, is necessary for diagnosis. This case demonstrates how important is understanding the genetics of globin chains to diagnose complex cases of hemoglobinopathies through the report of a newborn with Hb C/Beta0 thalassemia and heterozygous Hb B2 co-inheritance. A sample from the proband (a 25-day-old girl) was received with an FC hemoglobin profile for confirmatory diagnosis, accompanied by samples from her parents. The chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis confirmed the suggested profile. However, the absence of Hb A2 in the mother raised suspicions about the presence of a delta-chain Hb variant. In addition, high Hb A2 levels of the father sample suggested beta-thalassemia. Considering all possible genotypes that lead to the patient's profile, we conducted molecular analyses that confirmed heterozygosity for Hb C in the proband and mother, as well as the presence of an allele for beta0-thalassemia (CD39) in the father and child. Furthermore, the presence of Hb B2 or A2', a delta chain variant, was detected in homozygosity in the mother and heterozygosity in the patient. Subsequently, the diagnosis was confirmed by sequencing the HBB and HBD genes of the proband and mother, respectively. Confirmation of the diagnosis required specific knowledge about the genetics of globins and refined laboratory methodologies to validate the suspicions raised by chromatographic and electrophoretic investigations."

    "abstract": "β-Hemoglobinopathies are common monogenic disorders. In sickle cell disease (SCD), a single mutation in the β-globin (HBB) gene results in dysfunctional hemoglobin protein, while in β-thalassemia, over 300 mutations distributed across the gene reduce β-globin levels and cause severe anemia. Genetic engineering replacing the whole HBB gene through homology-directed repair (HDR) is an ideal strategy to restore a benign genotype and rescue HBB expression for most genotypes. However, this is technically challenging because (1) the insert must not be homologous to the endogenous gene and (2) synonymous codon-optimized, intron-less sequences may not reconstitute adequate β-globin levels. Here, we developed an HBB gene replacement strategy using CRISPR-Cas9 that successfully addresses these challenges. We determined that a DNA donor containing a diverged HBB coding sequence and heterologous introns to avoid sequence homology provides proper physiological expression. We identified a DNA donor that uses truncated γ-globin introns, results in 34% HDR, and rescues β-globin expression in in vitro models of SCD and β-thalassemia in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Furthermore, while HDR allele frequency dropped in vivo, it was maintained at ∼15%, demonstrating editing of long-term repopulating HSPCs. In summary, our HBB gene replacement strategy offers a differentiated approach by restoring naturally regulated adult hemoglobin expression."

    "abstract": "Clinically, α-thalassemia is stratified into mild, intermediate, and severe forms, differentiated by the degree of anemia severity. Specifically, severe α-thalassemia manifests in homozygous individuals, characterized by a profound α globin deficit. The presence of two α0 alleles, resulting in a complete four-gene defect (α<sup>--/--</sup>), constitutes a lethal in utero condition known as Hemoglobin (Hb) Barts hydrops fetalis syndrome. This arises from the inability of hemoglobin, deficient in α chains, to adequately transport oxygen. Consequently, this severe variant typically onsets during fetal development, often culminating in intrauterine death towards the end of gestation or dying shortly postpartum due to the compounded effects of severe anemia and resultant hypoxia. This study endeavors to establish an α-thalassemia mouse model via transplantation of embryonic liver cells harboring a dual α allele knockout, with a subsequent focus on comprehensively characterizing its hematological parameters and associated phenotypic indicators. To generate an α-globin chain-deficient mouse model, we transplanted fetal liver cells (harvested at embryonic day 13.5 from homozygous C57BL/6J-CD45.2-HBA-DKO mice) into C57BL/6 wild-type recipients preconditioned with 800 cGy irradiation. Multiple blood routine indicators, blood smear assessments, and spleen weight measurements, were subsequently conducted to characterize the model. Initially, model mice exhibited elevated white blood cell and lymphocyte counts relative to controls, potentially indicative of a possible immune reaction, though this response waned over time. Characteristic of the disease, these mice displayed significantly diminished mean corpuscular hemoglobin content and concentration, alongside heightened numbers of HbH inclusions and spleen weights. Furthermore, red blood cellindices, such as red blood cell count, hematocrit, red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation, and red cell distribution width-standard deviation, were all markedly increased in the model mice. Notably, model mice demonstrated significantly elevated values for mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and platelet large cell ratio percentage, reflective of aberrant platelet characteristics. Concurrently, a time-dependent increase in basophil percentages accompanied decreases in platelet count, platelet crit, and platelet larger cell count, collectively implying a progressively severe anemic state. Moreover, the progression from low to high levels of reticulocyte percentage and absolute reticulocyte count further corroborated an escalating tendency towards hemolysis. The model mice also experienced a substantial decline in body weight, underscoring the profound impact of disease progression on their health."

This study explores how caregivers of children with beta-thalassaemia major navigate healthcare services, aiming to identify facilitators and barriers to accessing optimal care. A qualitative interpretative phenomenological approach was employed. In-depth interviews with 18 purposively sampled caregivers from Karachi thalassaemia centres were conducted. Thematic analysis using a combined inductive-deductive approach identified themes within the interview data. The study revealed significant challenges for caregivers at individual, interpersonal and organisational levels. Lack of awareness about carrier states, limited disease knowledge, financial constraints and concerns about the child's future emerged as primary hurdles. Parents felt helpless due to the absence of emotional and social support for their children's treatment. Obstacles such as complicated registration processes at thalassaemia-care centres, high costs of chelating agents and blood unavailability were major barriers to seeking care and caregiving. Additionally, the study highlighted the absence of guidelines for thalassaemia-carrier detection among mothers during antenatal care. The study emphasised the importance of implementing premarital screening programmes due to the lack of knowledge about the disease and carrier state. To prevent the disease, it is crucial to include thalassaemia-carrier detection for mothers in antenatal guidelines and provide counselling at the primary level. Additionally, caregivers encountered treatment accessibility issues, prompting the establishment of a satellite thalassaemia centre linked to a top-tier tertiary care hospital in the public sector. This initiative addressed treatment challenges and improved overall care for patients with thalassaemia and their caregivers."

    "abstract": "To summarize and analyze the characteristics of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in children, in order to provide a scientific basis for clinical prevention, and ensure the safety of children's blood transfusion. The basic situation, clinical symptoms and signs, diagnosis time and disappearance time of alloantibody of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in children were retrospectively analyzed. The serological test, routine blood test, biochemical detection and urine analysis results were compared pre- and post-transfusion. Among 15 164 children with repeated blood transfusion, 23 cases occurred delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, with an incidence rate of 0.15%, and mainly children with thalassemia and acute leukemia. 39.13% of delayed hemolytic reactions occurred in children with more than 20 times of blood transfusions. Anemia was the main clinical symptom in 86.96% of children. 4.35% of children had hypotension and dyspnea. Serological test results showed that the positive rate of direct antiglobulin test was 91.30%, and that of erythrocyte homologous antibody test was 100%. Erythrocyte alloantibodies were common in Rh and Kidd blood group systems, accounting for 73.91% and 13.04%, respectively. Laboratory test results showed that hemoglobin, reticulocyte, spherocyte, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin and urine color were significantly different after transfusion compared with those before transfusion (all <i>P</i> <0.05). The average diagnosis time of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions was 18.56 days, and the average disappearance time of erythrocyte alloantibodies was 118.43 days. The incidence of delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction is high in children with repeated blood transfusion, and the disappearance time of erythrocyte homologous antibody is long. Blood matched ABO, Rh and Kidd blood group antigens should be transfused prophylactically. Once diagnosed, erythrocyte alloantibody corresponding to antigen-negative blood should be used throughout the whole process."

    "abstract": "To analyze the incidence of abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) in neonates in Guangzhou area, as well as the results of quantitative analysis of Hb in neonatal umbilical cord blood and genetic diagnosis of thalassemia in neonates with abnormal Hb; And to explore the hematological phenotypes and clinical characteristics of neonates with abnormal Hb and their parents, providing a reference for eugenics and childcare. 650 neonates born at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital who underwent Hb electrophoresis were included in this study. The results of routine blood test of umbilical cord blood , Hb electrophoresis and α-, β-thalassemia gene detection of the neonates were collected. The genotype distribution of thalassemia in the neonates was analyzed. Additionally, the abnormal Hb content of α and β variants was studied. Furthermore, the differences in hematological parameters between abnormal Hb neonates and normal neonates and α-thalassemia neonates, as well as between the parents of abnormal Hb neonates and normal adults were compared. Among the 650 neonates, 332 (51.08%) were diagnosed with thalassemia, including 235 cases of α-thalassemia (36.15%), 79 cases of β-thalassemia (12.15%), and 18 cases of compound αβ-thalassemia (2.77%). Among all the α-thalassemia genotypes, the most prevalent one was -- <sup><i>SEA</i></sup>/<i>αα</i> (48.94%), followed by <i>-α</i><sup>3.7</sup>/<i>αα</i> (20.00%), <i>-α<sup>4.2</sup>/αα</i> (11.06%), and <i>αα<sup>CS</sup>/αα</i> (8.94%). The four most common genotypes of β-thalassemia were <i>β</i><sup><i>CD41-42</i></sup> (32.91%), <i>β</i><sup><i>IVS-Ⅱ-654</i></sup> (26.58%), <i>β</i><sup>-28</sup> (21.52%), and <i>β</i><i><sup>E</sup></i> (10.13%), respectively. 275 cases of abnormal bands were found in Hb electrophoresis of umbilical cord blood, with a detection rate of 42.31%. The abnormal Hb content of α-variant in the neonates was significantly higher than that of β-variant (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The levels of Hb, MCV, MCH, Hb A, and Hb F in neonates with abnormal Hb were lower than those in normal neonates, while the RDW-CV was higher than that in normal neonates, with statistical significantce (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The levels of RBC and Hb A in neonates with abnormal Hb were lower than those in neonates with α-thalassemia, while the level of MCH was higher than that in neonats with α-thalassemia, with statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The levels of Hb, MCV, MCH, and Hb A in parents of neonates with abnormal Hb were lower than those in normal adults, while the RDW-CV was higher than that in normal adults, and the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The abnormal Hb content of α-variant in the neonates is significantly higher than that of β-variant in the neonates in Guangzhou, which can help to presume whether it is α chain or β chain based on the abnormal Hb content, providing a reference for globin gene sequencing. Meanwhile, analysis of various hematological screening-related indicators in neonates in the early stage is beneficial for early warning of the occurrence of abnormal Hb combined with thalassemia, reducing missed diagnoses to a certain extent."

    "abstract": "To identify the gene mutation types of 4 suspected β-thalassemia patients in Yunnan Province, and to analyze the genotypes and hematological phenotypes. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the samples of 4 suspected β-thalassemia patients from the Dai ethnic group in a thalassemia endemic area of Yunnan Province, whose hematological phenotypes were not consistent with the results of common thalassemia gene mutations. The mutations of β-globin gene clusters were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger DNA sequencing technology. The 3.5 kb deletion in β-globin gene cluster (NC_000011.10: g. 5224302-5227791del3490bp) was detected in 4 patients' samples, of which 1 case was also detected with HbE mutation and 1 case with CD17 mutation. These 2 patients displayed moderate anemia phenotype, while the two patients with only the 3.5 kb deletion presented with other mild anemia phenotype. Heterozygous carriers with rare 3.5 kb deletion of the β-globin gene cluster may develop mild anemia, compound mutations of the 3.5 kb deletion with other mutations may led to intermediate thalasemia with moderate to sever anemia. In areas with a high incidence of thalassemia, suspected patients should undergo genetic testing to avoid missing or misdiagnosing rare mutations."

    "abstract": "Malnutrition is a significant concern in children with β-thalassemia, impacting their growth and overall health. This study aimed to establish optimal thresholds for predicting malnutrition risk in children with β-thalassemia using muscle mass indicators derived from Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). A cross-sectional study was conducted with 162 pediatric patients diagnosed with β-thalassemia. Nutritional status of them was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards and references. BIA was performed to obtain fat-free mass (FFM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and soft lean mass (SLM). Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control for age and gender. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic performance. SLM-change < 6% demonstrated the highest sensitivity [0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.92] and a negative predictive value of 0.83 (95% CI 0.74-0.93), while FFM-change < 4% showed more balanced performance with a sensitivity of 0.58 (95% CI 0.45-0.71) and a specificity of 0.65 (95% CI 0.56-0.74). Percentage change indicators (FFM-change, SLM-change, and SMM-change) exhibited remarkable stability before and after PSM, indicating minimal influence from age and gender. This study established novel, age-adaptive thresholds (SLM-change < 6% and FFM-change < 4%) for predicting malnutrition risk in children with β-thalassemia. The findings suggest that these thresholds could serve as effective references to assess nutritional status across different age groups, providing new perspectives for personalized nutritional management strategies."

    "abstract": "Adenylate kinase (AK), also referred to as adenosine triphosphate-adenosine monophosphate phosphotransferase, serves an essential function in regulating cellular energy metabolism. A deficiency in red blood cell adenylate kinase 1 (AK-1) is linked to congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia as well as delays in both mental and psychomotor development. This deficiency is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder, with 13 highly pathogenic variants of the AK-1 gene documented globally through genetic testing. Thalassemia, a disorder of hemoglobin production, is a common monogenic inherited disease in southern China. Severe forms of thalassemia result in defective hemoglobin synthesis, leading to hemolytic anemia due to the breakdown of red blood cells. A molecular investigation was carried out on a proband with severe hemolytic anemia from a family in Guangxi, China, to identify the underlying cause of the anemia and associated clinical manifestations, offering valuable information for family planning and prenatal counseling. Hematological, biochemical, and thalassemia-specific genetic testing were performed on the proband and family members in relation to chronic hemolytic anemia. Whole-exome sequencing was utilized to detect genetic variants, followed by an analysis of their pathogenic potential. Confirmation was conducted using Sanger sequencing. Prenatal diagnosis was carried out by analyzing amniotic fluid during the mother's second pregnancy. The proband, who presented with severe hemolytic anemia, was diagnosed with the thalassemia genotype<sup>- SEA</sup>/αα compound β<sup>CD41-42</sup>/β<sup>N</sup>. A homozygous mutation, c.464delA (p.Lys155Arg fs*39), was identified in exon 6 of the AK-1 gene. A case of mild thalassemia with severe anemia was investigated, leading to the identification of a novel mutation in the AK-1 gene. Bioinformatics tools predicted the pathogenic nature of this variant, linking it to AK deficiency, which may contribute to the observed severe anemia and associated clinical symptoms."

    "abstract": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels are influenced by various genetic modifiers, which have clinically beneficial effects on both β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. HbF-associated genetic variants are distributed throughout the genome, and current detection methods are often costly, time-consuming, and require multiple tests. Therefore, developing rapid and economical methods for the simultaneous detection of HbF-associated variants is essential for improving the accurate diagnosis of β-hemoglobinopathies. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was employed to detect 20 well-documented genetic modifiers in BCL11A, KLF1, HBG2, DNMT1, GATAD2A, and HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism (HMIP). The new assay's accuracy, repeatability, and lowest detection limit were evaluated. It was subsequently applied to 81 samples, and the clinical effects of the modifiers were further verified in a cohort of 560 β-thalassemia patients. The MALDI-TOF MS assays successfully detected all 20 genetic modifiers simultaneously in a single reaction. Genotyping results from 15 repetitions were consistent and accurate, indicating the stability of this assay. The assay's lowest detection limit for DNA was as low as 0.2 ng, sufficient for simultaneous genotyping of all loci. A double-blind evaluation of 81 samples showed 100% concordance with traditional genotyping methods. Significant differences were observed in HbF levels, survival time without transfusion, and clinical classification for the detected genetic modifiers. The MALDI-TOF MS detection assay for HbF-related variants is simple, rapid and high throughput. It enables the detection of 20 genetic modifiers in a single test, supporting accurate large-scale detection and enhancing the precise diagnosis and clinical classification of β-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies are among the most common inherited diseases and they are believed to be one of the major etiologic factors contributing to anemia. Thalassemia is characterized by an altered hemoglobin (Hb) chain synthesis and may appear as alpha-(α-)thalassemia and/or beta-(β-)thalassemia. The clinical manifestations of thalassemia may range from asymptomatic to severe, with the potential to ultimately result in death. The search for an underlying cause was prompted by the discovery of an asymptomatic patient of Thai origin with microcytic anemia and no iron deficiency during a routine hematological examination. Genetic sequencing results revealed Hb Paksé, α2 CD 142 [A > T] (HBA2:c.429 A > T) and HbE β2 CD 26 [G > A] (HBB: c.79 G > A). It is essential that the identification and knowledge of Hb mutations facilitate the clinical recognition, genetic testing, and counseling of patients with thalassemia. The combination of two thalassemia Hb variants, one in the α-globin gene as Hb Paksé and one in β-globin gene as Hb E, in a single individual is occasionally described in East Asia. The first appearance of combined heterozygosity for Hb Paksé, and Hb E in Europe provides evidence that this is the result of a migration-caused occurrence."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of major disease biomarkers is frequently hindered by complex environmental factors and their inherently low expression levels. To overcome these challenges, a self-powered, smartphone-assisted dual-mode biosensing platform has been developed, utilizing functional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and G-quadruplex (G-4s) DNA nanostructures to significantly amplify signal output and enhance detection accuracy. This innovative system utilizes gold nanoparticle/zirconium-based MOF/graphdiyne composites (AuNPs/Zr-MOF/GDY) and self-assembles methylene blue (MB) with G-quadruplex (G-4s) DNA nanostructures for detecting the thalassemia gene CD122. Upon target detection, the G-4s structure triggers strand displacement and cation coordination, followed by MB adsorption to form a biocathode. This biocathode facilitates electron transfer to a glucose oxidase-functionalized anode, driving redox reactions with system-generated electrons. The MB/G-4s structure not only amplifies the CD122 signal but also induces proportional color changes for dual electrochemical and colorimetric detection. A high-output-power capacitor is integrated to further amplify signals, enhancing sensitivity by 7.2 times. The platform offers a broad linear range from 0.0001 to 1000 pM and achieves low detection limits of 18.9 aM (electrochemical) and 23.9 aM (colorimetric) (S/N = 3). This work presents a highly accurate, sensitive, and portable detection platform for rapid analysis in various environments, including remote and challenging settings."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are among the most frequent monogenic hereditary diseases. Access to transfusions, iron chelation therapies and drugs such as hydroxyurea have improved life expectancy and quality of life. However, these diseases still cause significant disability. The first available curative therapy, bone marrow transplantation, is unfortunately not feasible for all patients. Over the past decade, numerous studies have focused on finding new curative therapies, and many clinical trials have evaluated different gene therapy approaches. The therapeutic targets focus on adding functional copies of the gene encoding β-globin in defective CD34 + cells, mainly using lentiviral vectors directed towards HSCs. More recently, the focus has shifted to inducing fetal hemoglobin production at therapeutic levels or repairing the underlying molecular defect, using novel gene editing techniques involving CRISPR-Cas9, transcription activation-like effector protein nucleases, zinc finger nucleases and base editing. Preclinical and clinical studies now focus on optimizing how gene therapy is performed and delivered to reduce or eliminate myeloablative treatment and its potential adverse events. In this review, we explore the potential to induce fetal hemoglobin production at therapeutic levels or to repair the underlying molecular defect that causes the disease genetically. Here, we review recent gene editing studies that are opening a new era in curative treatment for hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) and grade 4 astrocytoma (ASTROG4) are aggressive primary brain tumors characterized by rapid growth, invasiveness, and poor prognosis, differentiated by the presence or absence of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 classification. Essential molecular markers, in addition to IDH mutations, include alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) loss and p53 expression, which significantly influence their classification and prognosis. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a critical enzyme in tumor metabolism, has been implicated in glioma progression, but its prognostic significance remains unclear. This prospective study aimed to quantitatively measure PKM2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression in GBM (IDH wildtype) versus ASTROG4 (IDH R132H mutant), to assess the correlation between PKM2 expression and prognosis in these two patient groups, and to investigate the prognostic significance of ATRX and p53 expression in relation to PKM2 levels. A total of 67 patients with high-grade gliomas (43 GBM, 24 ASTROG4) were analyzed using IHC for IDH1, ATRX, p53, and PKM2. PKM2 expression was quantified using 3DHISTECH (Budapest, Hungary) image analysis software, and correlations with clinical parameters, survival, and other molecular markers were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models assessed the impact of PKM2 expression and clinical factors on prognosis. PKM2 expression was observed in both GBM and ASTROG4, with no significant differences in positivity rates. However, high PKM2 intensity scores significantly correlated with increased mortality risk (p=0.041). ATRX-negative tumors showed elevated PKM2 levels, suggesting compensatory metabolic adaptations. ASTROG4 cases had better survival outcomes than GBM. Severe preoperative motor deficits were associated with a threefold increase in mortality risk, highlighting the critical role of clinical factors in determining prognosis. PKM2 plays an important role in glioma metabolism and can serve as a potential therapeutic target. Its association with ATRX highlights its involvement in tumor progression and genomic instability. Combining molecular markers with clinical parameters can improve prognostic accuracy and inform personalized treatment strategies for astrocytic tumors."

Pregnancy-induced hypertension represents a critical issue within the fields of obstetrics and gynecology, where precise diagnosis and forecasting are essential for effective management. The potential for misdiagnosis, often stemming from the inexperience of healthcare professionals, underscores the necessity for an advanced diagnostic system. This research introduces an innovative sampling and feature selection technique grounded in <i>F</i>-scores optimization, alongside the development of a comprehensive prediction model that integrates genetic algorithms with various heterogeneous learners. The objective of this model is to maximize the utility of medical data and enhance treatment quality. The refined intelligent feature selection approach identified several significant indicators of pregnancy-related hypertension, such as phosphor dehydrogenase deficiency, body mass index, gestational urinary proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1, placental growth factor, thalassemia, and a familial history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. The model achieved superior performance metrics, including the highest recall (0.768), <i>F</i>-score (0.728), and area under the curve (0.832) when compared to other prevalent models. Furthermore, the area under the curve for both early and late clinical assessments reached peak values of 0.996 and 0.792, respectively, when evaluated using the ratio of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 to placental growth factor. The intelligent diagnosis and prediction methodology for gestational hypertension proposed in this study exhibited remarkable efficacy and holds significant promise for implementation in both educational and clinical settings within obstetrics and gynecology, thereby advancing intelligent medical diagnostics in China."

Earthquakes are known to disrupt community living standards, cause serious health problems and deaths, and have a greater impact on the health of children with chronic diseases and their caregivers. It is important to reveal the experiences specific to the disease in order to improve post-earthquake care and support processes. To explore the experiences of traumatized mothers caring for their children with Beta-Thalassemia after the earthquake and their expectations from nurses. This study used a qualitative exploratory research design with a phenomenological approach. A total sample of 20 mothers with varying experience participated. Data were collected in a pediatric hematology/oncology ward in a province in Turkey where children with thalassemia were hospitalized. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data between October 2023 and June 2024. The data were analyzed using content analysis procedures. Max Qualitative Data Analysis (2020) programme was used to code the data. As a result of the data analysis of this study, four themes and 14 sub-themes emerged. These four main themes were: \"Emotions related to the caregiving experience,\" \"Difficulties in managing the disease,\" \"Mothers' need for support,\" and \"Expectations and recommendations.\" In the section on expectations from nurses, mothers stated that health services should not be interrupted, that it is necessary to make plans against emergencies, and that they demand psychological support from nurses during this process. The results highlight the multifaceted challenges faced by mothers of children with thalassemia and emphasize the need for uninterrupted care, medication management, contingency planning and psychological support by nurses and health care providers in all circumstances. An understanding of such experiences, involving those distinctive to Turkey culture, is especially vital to inform the care of these children and enhance their quality of life. Future research should explore practices for nurses to understand parents' psychosocial distress and coping strategies and intervene when necessary to provide support and guidance from the beginning of treatment and care."

    "abstract": "Nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning is being used increasingly with success in matched related donor (MRD) and alternative donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD). Advantages include decrease toxicity and applicability in patients otherwise unable to tolerate conditioning regimens due to end-organ damage or age. We aimed to add to published data outcomes of two similar NMA conditioning protocols, termed Protocol 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT00061568) and Protocol 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02105766)) in mainly adult patients with SCD to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and success of these regimens in individuals at high-risk for poor transplantation-related outcomes. We also evaluated the tolerability and outcomes of Protocol 2, which included preconditioning immunodepletion, in patients at even higher risk of T cell-mediated rejection or plasma/B cell-mediated anti-donor erythrocyte antibody production-the latter due to ABO incompatibility or recipient RBC alloimmunization to a donor antigen. Finally, we evaluated the incidence and trajectory of mixed donor myeloid chimerism over time following allo-HCT. In this retrospective analysis of the 2 prospective phase 2 NMA transplant protocols, 91 individuals with SCD or transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia underwent MRD allo-HCT at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; regimens contained alemtuzumab, low-dose radiation, and sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with or without preconditioning immunodepletion with pentostatin and oral cyclophosphamide (Protocol 2). In the total cohort of 91 transplantation recipients, outcomes were favorable with timely neutrophil and platelet engraftment (median, 21 days [range, 7 to 67 days] and 21 days [range, 10 to 112 days], respectively), minimal high-grade acute GVHD and no chronic GVHD, overall survival of 90%, sickle-free survival of 85%, and mixed donor myeloid chimerism in 43% at a median follow up of 7.3 years (range, 0.8 to 20 years). Most patients with mixed myeloid chimerism at 2-years post-HCT remained stable in their values. In analyzing each protocol separately, outcomes were comparable except for higher cytomegalovirus reactivation necessitating treatment in Protocol 2 without an associated increase in graft failure. In the combined cohort, graft failure occurred in 11 patients, and hematologic malignancy or abnormal cytogenetics on bone marrow evaluation developed in 7 patients. In a subanalysis of factors that may implicate transplantation outcomes, the number of RBC units transfused post-HCT was significantly higher in recipients with pre-HCT history of alloimmunization to donor RBC antigens. There was no difference in the number of RBC units transfused, duration of transfusion, or red cell engraftment in those with major ABO incompatibility; preconditioning immunodepletion and pretreatment with rituximab likely were helpful. Both NMA allo-HCT protocols were successful in achieving adequate engraftment and sickle-free survival with minimal toxicity, including in individuals with mixed donor myeloid chimerism. The addition of preconditioning immunodepletion was well-tolerated and reduced the rate of graft failure in high-risk recipients."

For these reasons, the antigenic immune response after a vaccine risks being ineffective. We evaluated the anti-spike IgG production after two doses of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in patients affected by hemoglobinopathies. All 114 enrolled patients (100%) developed adequate antibody production, with a median value of serum IgG of 2184.4 BAU/mL (IQR 1127.4-3502.9). The amount of antibody was unrelated to any other clinical characteristics evaluated, including transfusion dependence or non-transfusion dependence, age, gender, disease type, ferritin, blood count, spleen status, and therapy with hydroxyurea or iron chelators (in all the cases <i>p</i> > 0.05). Moreover, 47 (41.2%) patients developed breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 2 years of follow-up after vaccination, all with a mildly symptomatic course, without requiring hospitalization or experiencing a significative drop in hemoglobin values, allowing for a slight delay in their transfusion regimen. Vaccination against COVID-19 is safe and effective for patients affected by hemoglobinopathies, ensuring adequate protection from severe infection."

    "abstract": "The inherited genetic disorder β-thalassemia affects the hematopoietic system and is caused by the low production or absence of adult hemoglobin (HbA). Ineffective erythropoiesis is the hallmark of β-thalassemia pathophysiology and is characterized by an erythropoietin-driven substantial increase in erythroblast proliferation, coupled with an increase in late-stage precursor apoptosis, which results in low levels of circulating mature red blood cells (RBCs) and chronic anemia. Mitochondrial dysfunction commonly occurs in these cells because of the increased demand for energy production and the need to manage abnormal hemoglobin chain synthesis. Moreover, several studies have highlighted the importance of gradual mitochondrial clearance for mature erythroid cell production. This review offers an overview of the mitochondrial role in essential cellular processes, particularly those crucial for maintaining RBC health and function. Additionally, recent evidence regarding the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to the pathophysiology and severity of β-thalassemia is discussed, along with updated insights into indirect mitochondria-targeting treatments, which present potential pharmacological targets."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia, a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, is caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the β-globin chains of hemoglobin. Three clinical conditions are recognized: β-thalassemia major, β-thalassemia intermedia, and β-thalassemia minor (β-Thal<sup>+</sup>). This latter condition occurs when an individual inherits a mutated β-globin gene from one parent. In erythrocytes from β-Thal<sup>+</sup> subjects, the excess α-globin chains produce unstable α-tetramers, which can induce substantial oxidative stress leading to plasma membrane and cytoskeleton damage, as well as deranged cellular function. In the present study, we hypothesized that increased oxidative stress might lead to structural rearrangements in erythrocytes from β-Thal<sup>+</sup> volunteers and functional alterations of ion transport proteins, including band 3 protein. The data obtained showed significant modifications of the cellular shape in erythrocytes from β-Thal<sup>+</sup> subjects. In particular, a significantly increased number of elliptocytes was observed. Interestingly, iron overload, detected in erythrocytes from β-Thal<sup>+</sup> subjects, provoked a significant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), overactivation of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, and glutathione depletion, resulting in (a) increased lipid peroxidation, (b) protein sulfhydryl group (-SH) oxidation. Iron overload-related oxidative stress affected Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, which in turn may have contributed to impaired β-Thal<sup>+</sup> erythrocyte deformability. As a result, alterations in the distribution of cytoskeletal proteins, including α/β-spectrin, protein 4.1, and α-actin, in erythrocytes from β-Thal<sup>+</sup> subjects have been detected. Significantly, oxidative stress was also associated with increased phosphorylation and altered band 3 ion transport activity, as well as increased oxidized hemoglobin, which led to abnormal clustering and redistribution of band 3 on the plasma membrane. Taken together, these findings contribute to elucidating potential oxidative stress-related perturbations of ion transporters and associated cytoskeletal proteins, which may affect erythrocyte and systemic homeostasis in β-Thal<sup>+</sup> subjects."

    "abstract": "B-thalassemia is a genetic disorder that leads to reduced or absent β-globin chains, often resulting in endocrine abnormalities due to iron overload, chronic anemia, and hypoxia. This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors for glucose metabolism disturbances in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) patients, focusing on pancreatic iron overload and its association with other iron biomarkers. We studied two groups of TDT patients (2018-2022) at Hippokration General Hospital: Group 1 (no glucose metabolism impairment, n = 46) and Group 2 (with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus, n = 18). Patients were assessed for factors contributing to glucose disturbances, and laboratory data were analyzed. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed per American Diabetes Association criteria, and impaired glucose tolerance was defined by OGTT results. A multivariate logistic regression identified potential independent risk factors. In a subset of patients on iron chelation therapy, we examined the relationship between pancreatic, liver, and heart iron overload (T2* MRI) and glucose/ferritin levels. Age and elevated serum GGT levels were significantly associated with impaired glucose metabolism (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Beta-blocker use was correlated with glucose disturbances (<i>p</i> = 0.02), but multivariate analysis revealed no significant independent risk factors. A significant relationship was found between pancreatic and heart iron overload (r = 0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.04). Elevated GGT levels suggest that oxidative stress and liver dysfunction play a key role in glucose metabolism disturbances. Pancreatic MRI T2* may help predict heart iron overload. Further research is needed to identify reliable biomarkers for glucose regulation in TDT."

    "title": "Exploratory Review and In Silico Insights into circRNA and RNA-Binding Protein Roles in γ-Globin to β-Globin Switching.",
    "abstract": "β-globin gene cluster regulation involves complex mechanisms to ensure proper expression and function in RBCs. During development, switching occurs as γ-globin is replaced by β-globin. Key regulators, like BCL11A and ZBTB7A, repress γ-globin expression to facilitate this transition with other factors, like KLF1, LSD1, and PGC-1α; these regulators ensure an orchestrated transition from γ- to β-globin during development. While these mechanisms have been extensively studied, circRNAs have recently emerged as key contributors to gene regulation, but their role in β-globin gene cluster regulation remains largely unexplored. Although discovered in the 1970s, circRNAs have only recently been recognized for their functional roles, particularly in interactions with RNA-binding proteins. Understanding how circRNAs contribute to switching from γ- to β-globin could lead to new therapeutic strategies for hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. This review uses the circAtlas 3.0 database to explore circRNA expressions in genes related to switching from γ- to β-globin expression, focusing on blood, bone marrow, liver, and spleen. It emphasizes the exploration of the potential interactions between circRNAs and RNA-binding proteins involved in β-globin gene cluster regulatory mechanisms, further enhancing our understanding of β-globin gene cluster expression."

    "abstract": "Several studies were performed to evaluate the relationship between CBC and patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). In this review, we discussed the prognostic value of CBC parameters in DM patients. English literature was searched and retrieved from the Google Scholar search engine and PubMed database (1980-2024). \"Diabetes mellitus,\" \"Blood cell count,\" \"Mean platelet volume,\" \"Leukocytes,\" and \"Inflammation\" were used as keywords. DM increases vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, while vascular inflammation affects erythropoiesis and red blood cell deformation, thus increasing red cell distribution width (RDW). Mean platelet volume (MPV) is another useful prognostic biomarker for DM patients. Additionally, elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) levels are associated with poor glycemic control in T2DM patients, so it can be used as a screening tool in diabetic follow-up. RDW can be used as a valuable independent biomarker to assess the prognosis of patients with DM. MPV can also be used as a noninvasive, widely available, and low-cost marker as a key factor as well as a Prognostic/diagnostic biomarker that could be used for DM patients. Total white blood cell count, NLR, Mean platelet volume lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), and monocyte to high-density lipoprotein ratio (MHR) are valuable biomarkers in predicting DM."

    "abstract": "Beta thalassemia is a hereditary blood condition characterized by a decrease or absence in the production of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. Patients with beta-thalassemia major often require regular blood transfusions and are at an increased risk of developing complications such as iron overload and cardiac injury. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in Klotho protein as a multifunctional protein known for its anti-aging and cardio-protective properties. Several studies have revealed a potential correlation between Troponin, a protein released into the circulation as a result of heart muscle damage, and the level of Klotho protein. This study included thirty Beta-Thalassemia Major (β-TM) patients and thirty control healthy subjects. Levels of Klotho protein and Troponin-I were determined using the ELISA technique and measured for all participants. Serum Klotho protein and Troponin-I levels were significantly elevated in β-TM patients compared to healthy control subjects (P< 0.001). A positive correlation was found between serum Klotho protein and Troponin-I in the β-TM patients' group. A positive correlation was found between serum Klotho protein and Troponin-I in the β-TM patients, which may highlight a relationship between Klotho and cardiac damage."

    "abstract": "Identification of hemoglobin (Hb) variants is valuable in clinical testing. A common issue with conventional methods for identifying Hb variants is their subpar ability to provide structural breakdowns of the variants. Reports have surfaced of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) methods that improve on traditional methods; however, ambiguities may arise without separation of Hb subunits prior to HR-MS analysis. We report a liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR-MS) method to separate several pairs of normal and variant Hb subunits with mass shifts of less than 1 Da and successfully identify them in intact-protein and top-down analyses. LC separation was facilitated by a C4 reversed-phase column. Seven heterozygous Hb variant samples (Hb C with α-thalassemia trait, Hb E, Hb D-Punjab, Hb G-Accra, Hb G-Siriraj, Hb Tarrant, and Hb G-Waimanalo) were selected to demonstrate the LC separation of Hb variant and normal subunits with mass shifts of less than 1 Da. The analytes could be explicitly observed in the deconvoluted MS<sup>1</sup> mass spectra. The top-down analysis matched the amino acid sequences of the correct Hb variant subunits. The LC-HR-MS method described can effectively separate and identify Hb subunits, especially when the variant subunits have mass deviations of less than 1 Da from their corresponding normal subunits. With further evaluation to prove the clinical utility, the HR-MS methods including CE-HR-MS have the potential to complement or partially replace conventional methods of Hb variant identification in clinical laboratories."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by defective hemoglobin production, leading to chronic anemia and the necessity for lifelong blood transfusions. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is a compensatory mechanism in which blood-producing tissue forms outside the bone marrow. The occurrence of extramedullary hematopoiesis as a pelvic mass is rare. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with β-thalassemia major who was found to have a pelvic fat-containing mass incidentally on imaging. A diagnostic laparotomy revealed a highly vascular mass. Complete resection was not feasible due to significant hemorrhage, necessitating postoperative embolization for hemostasis. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Postoperatively, the patient developed severe anemia, requiring frequent transfusions. To reduce transfusion dependency, splenic artery embolization was performed. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the rare presentation of extramedullary hematopoiesis as a pelvic mass. Accurate diagnosis is critical, as surgical removal can result in severe hemorrhage and worsening anemia. Splenic artery embolization provides a valuable therapeutic approach to managing transfusion burden in such cases."

Currently, there is no definitive cure for thalassemia; therefore, early screening for thalassemia is the focus of clinical research. In recent years, thalassemia screening technology has been continuously developed, leading to updates in screening methods and significant improvements in accuracy. Genetic testing and hemoglobin electrophoresis are more popular in high-resource areas, effectively reducing the birth rate of children with severe thalassemia. This review summarizes current research on thalassemia screening from the perspectives of premarital, prenatal, and neonatal screening. In addition, the latest research on treatment of thalassemia has been concluded from the induction of fetal hemoglobin to gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is known to exert multifaceted effects on pregnancy, potentially influencing placental structure and function. Our aim was to utilize stereology as a precise analytical tool to evaluate the histo-morphologic and functional changes in term placentae of women with SCD against those of non-SCD women. A case control study was conducted at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital's labour unit and included 38 pregnant women, comprising 19 cases and 19 controls. Placenta samples were paired and matched with gestational age and taken at term (38 weeks + 2 weeks). Tissue sections were prepared, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and volume densities of syncytial knots, foetal capillaries, syncytial denuded areas, and intervillous spaces estimated by stereological methods. Statistical analysis was performed to compare mean values between the SCD and control groups. Among the study participants with SCD, 13.16% (5) had sickle cell haemoglobin S (HbSS), 34.21% (13) had haemoglobin C (HbSC) and 2.63% (1) had β-thalassemia (HbS). On stereological assessment, there were statistically significant differences in mean volume densities of syncytial knots (p = < 0.0034), foetal capillaries (p = < 0.0001), syncytial denudations (p = < 0.0028), and intervillous space (p = < 0.0113) between term placentae of women with SCD and those without SCD. SCD placentae may result in a substantial increase in syncytial knot formation, possibly because of hypermaturation of the chorionic villi, significant increase in foetal capillaries potentially due to the hypoxic nature of the SCD placentae, syncytial denuded areas as a result of alteration of the placental syncytium and reduced intervillous spaces which may be due to villous congestion. These findings suggest the need for heightened monitoring of placental function and fetal well-being in pregnancies complicated by SCD to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Guizhou Province is an area with high incidence of thalassemia. However, there are few large-sample studies on the correlation between genotypes and phenotypes in Guizhou Province. In this study, the phenotypes and genotypes of 1174 patients with thalassemia in Guizhou Province were collected, and the relationship between different genotypes and phenotypes was analyzed, providing a more accurate basis for genetic counseling, prevention and control of thalassemia. A total of 1174 patients with thalassemia were collected in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital from October 2020 to December 2021 by PCR-reverse dot blot (RDB) hybridization assay, and their red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), mean erythrocyte volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), hemoglobin (HbA), hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) data were collected. The relationship between different genotypes and phenotypes was analyzed. Among 1174 cases of thalassemia or carriers, there were 617 cases of a-thalassemia, 512 cases of b-thalassemia, 45 cases of coinheritance of aand b-tha-lassemia. The severity of anemia between a-thalassemia was positively correlated with the decrease of non-functional copy number of a-globin gene. The degree of anemia in non-deletion a-thalassemia was greater than that in deletion a-thalassemia. In b-thalassemia, b0 gene mutation did not produce b-globin, and b+ mutation expressed some bglobin, but it was lower than normal level. b0/b0 had no bglobin production, and long-term blood transfusion was required to maintain life. Compared with a-thalassemia, the degree of anemia in b-thalassemia whose clinical type was same as a-thalassemia was more serious. The anemia degree of coinheritance of aand b-thalassemia was less than that of simple a-thalassemia or b-thalassemia. The clinical phenotype of thalassemia is influenced by molecular mechanism, and the two kinds of thalassemia can interact with each other. The clinical severity is positively correlated with the imbalance of a peptide chain and b peptide chain. A comprehensive understanding of the hematologic phenotype differences between different genotypes and subtypes of thalassemia can provide more accurate data for genetic counseling of thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies are a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by either a reduced synthesis of one or more normal globin chains or the synthesis of a structurally abnormal globin chain or, in a few cases, by both that is, the reduced synthesis of a haemoglobin (Hb) variant. Depending on the mutations, these patients may exhibit distorted Hb patterns along with altered red cell indices, both of which can be used to support identification by diagnostic tools. The approach in the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia depends upon the target geographical population and aim of testing. Red cell indices, Hb pattern analysis on high-performance liquid chromatography, and Hb capillary-zone electrophoresis are the first-line screening tests, and molecular testing helps confirm the diagnosis and is also useful in prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Thalassemia patients need lifelong medical care, receiving trasfusions and supplemental therapies, and therefore, timely diagnosis and screening is essential. In the present paper, we review the potential pitfalls and interfering factors in their diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Although spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), hereditary hearing loss (HL), and thalassemia are common monogenic genetic diseases, the carrier frequencies and variant spectrums of these diseases show regional differences, even within China. Their carrier frequencies and variant spectrums in Southern Zhejiang, China are unclear. Saliva was collected for carrier screening and amniotic fluid, villi, and peripheral blood were collected for prenatal diagnosis. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used to detect the copy number of SMN1 exon 7. PCR coupled with flow-through hybridization, MLPA, and Sanger sequencing were used to detect common genes for HL and thalassemia. Common variants were detected in 15.14% (2109/13926) of the 13,926 women of reproductive age from South Zhejiang who participated in this study. The carrier frequencies of SMA, HL, and thalassemia were 2.11% (294/13926), 4.87% (678/13926), and 8.82% (1228/13926), respectively. In total, 56.47% (1117/1978) of husbands were successfully recalled. The total number of at-risk couples was 111 (111/13926, 0.80%). Further, 47 families underwent prenatal diagnosis. A total of 13 (13/13926; 0.93‰) affected pregnancies were identified. Our findings confirm that SMA, HL, and thalassemia are highly prevalent in Southern Zhejiang, with some regional specificity, as compared with recent large population-based surveys in China. Further, a rapid saliva sample-based non-invasive screening method was established, and its feasibility was demonstrated."

This study aimed to assess changes in phosphate homeostasis and associated factors, including FGF-23 and explore relationships between iron overload, FGF23 levels, and phosphorus regulation for clinical management of phosphate disorders, in children with β-TM. 143 β-TM patients (57.3% male, median age 12 years) were recruited from Fatimid Foundation Karachi, a blood transfusion facility from January to October 2022. Clinical and biochemical evaluations were conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, including serum ferritin, calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), vitamin D levels, and FGF-23. Descriptive and inferential statistics including multivariable analysis were applied. This study enrolled 143 patients, with 57.3% males. The median age was 12 years, with 53% underweight. Blood transfusion rates varied, with 66.4% receiving 2/month. Bone/joint pain was reported by 76.2%, with 60.8% requiring analgesics. Median serum ferritin was 2768.3 ng/mL.

One of the most difficult to accurately diagnose is alpha-thalassemia, which is indicated by the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) Barts on NBS. This mixed methods study incorporated (1) an implementation and quality improvement project to demonstrate the clinical utility of genetic testing added to standard procedures for likely alpha-thalassemia trait and (2) a qualitative study to determine the related educational needs of primary care providers (PCPs). During a two-year period, we attempted to perform alpha-globin genetic testing for all newborns with an abnormal NBS result (an \"FA + Barts\" pattern). We conducted semi-structured interviews with seven PCPs for thematic abstraction. In sixty neonates with presumed Hb Barts on initial NBS who had genetic testing, three (5%) did not have alpha-thalassemia. The remaining 57 (95%) had an alpha-thalassemia trait genotype. Non-deletion alpha-thalassemia occurred in 5%. Eight (13%) had genotypes that substantially altered genetic counseling for the individual and family members. Race and ethnicity were poor surrogates for genotype. PCPs expressed a willingness to participate in NBS follow up but had little specific knowledge about alpha-thalassemia. The addition of genetic testing for likely alpha-thalassemia trait to NBS had very high clinical utility, supporting its use in standard clinical care. Whenever possible, education and genetic counseling should not be provided based on the detection of possible Hb Barts alone without subsequent specific genetic verification. Educational and outreach programs for both PCPs and families about the importance of testing and trait counseling are needed for ongoing improvement."

Relatively decreased red blood cell (RBC) PK activity (reflected by a lower PK/hexokinase [HK] ratio) and PK thermostability (PK activity after exposure to heat) were recently identified as pathophysiological features of sickle cell disease (SCD). In this study, we investigated whether impaired PK function is associated with sickle RBC properties and SCD-related clinical manifestations. This study included 97 non-transfused patients with SCD (88 HbSS, 9 HbS/β0 thalassemia). PK thermostability was correlated with RBC parameters such as reticulocyte count (r = -0.402, p < 0.0001) and hemoglobin F (r = 0.394, p < 0.0001), and indicators of impaired functional properties of sickle RBCs, such as the point of sickling (r = -0.417, p < 0.0001), oxygen affinity (r = 0.408, p < 0.001) and RBC adhesion to laminin (r = -0.322, p = 0.024). Additionally, a low PK/HK ratio correlated with decreased PK thermostability (r = 0.308, p = 0.002), decreased RBC deformability (r = 0.268, p = 0.009), and elevated 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels (r = -0.244, p = 0.016). Multivariate Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that reduced PK thermostability and PK/HK ratio were associated with a higher incidence of SCD-related clinical complications. For every 10-unit decrease in PK thermostability and 1-unit decrease in PK/HK ratio, the incidence of SCD-related clinical complications increased by 11% (p = 0.012) and 10% (p = 0.019), respectively. Altogether, these findings indicate that impaired PK function is related to compromised sickle RBC properties and SCD-related clinical manifestations. This supports the relevance and underlines the potential of PK activation therapy."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the frequency of alloimmunization within the Rhesus blood group system and identify the most prevalent alloantibodies. A comprehensive search across multiple databases was conducted to locate epidemiological studies reporting alloimmunization in thalassemia patients undergoing repeated transfusions, specifically focusing on Rhesus antibodies. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, and heterogeneity was assessed using I<sup>2</sup> statistics. This review included 20 studies with a total of 4,650 patients. The overall prevalence of alloimmunization was 5.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.1-9.3%) across all ages, with a prevalence of 9.1% (95% CI: 5.3-15.2%) in children and 25% (95% CI: 12.7-41.2%) in adults. The pooled overall prevalence was 6.6% (95% CI: 4.2-10.2%). Among the 488 alloimmunized patients, 310 developed Rhesus-specific antibodies, with anti-E (34.58%) and anti-D (13.69%) being the most frequent. This study underscores the substantial prevalence of Rhesus antibodies among alloimmunized thalassemia patients. Implementing extended phenotype matching for transfusions could significantly reduce the risk of alloantibody formation in this population. Future analyses should explore factors influencing alloimmunization rates, such as ethnic diversity, matching protocols, and age-related variations, to inform clinical practice better."

    "abstract": "Hydrops fetalis is a critical diagnosis given the poor prognosis and vast differential of potential causes. After a detailed anatomic survey, the first step in differentiating among the various causes is measurement of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity to evaluate for anemia. Anemia is the key decision point in the diagnostic algorithm that categorizes hydrops. This approach is more practical than an immune versus nonimmune classification because it capitalizes on clues available at the time of sonographic diagnosis and expedites care toward possible therapies, such as intrauterine transfusion. The causes of hydrops that share the underlying physiology of fetal anemia include alloimmunization, which accounts for 10% of cases, congenital infections, hemoglobinopathies, and fetomaternal hemorrhage. After ruling out anemia, the differential diagnosis expands to cardiovascular disorders (20%-28% of cases), genetic abnormalities (10%-30% of cases), fetal masses (eg, congenital lung masses, sacrococcygeal teratomas), and monochorionic twin complications. Even after a thorough evaluation, 15% of hydrops cases remain of unknown cause. There are treatments available for select disorders that have the potential to reverse the signs of hydrops. Several imaging pitfalls should be avoided when establishing the diagnosis of hydrops, such as mistaking abdominal wall muscles, physiologic pericardial fluid, or thick subcutaneous tissue as pathologic fluid accumulation. A practical and comprehensive approach to the diagnostic evaluation for hydrops fetalis avoids delays in diagnosis and expedites potential life-saving treatment of this disorder. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article."

Other indicators of hemolytic reaction were also analyzed. Compared with the placebo group after treatment of 12 weeks, the thalidomide group showed a longer RBC lifespan (16.29 ± 6.42 vs 12.90 ± 4.98 days; P = 0.004), smaller mean corpuscular volume (68.34 ± 7.79 vs 78.01 ± 6.33 fl; P < 0.001), smaller mean corpuscular hemoglobin (21.62 ± 2.85 vs 24.68 ± 2.69 pg; P < 0.001), and lower lactate dehydrogenase (190.00 [148.00 - 305.00] vs 251.00 [199.20 - 327.80]; P = 0.014). Meanwhile, thalidomide significantly increased the RBC lifespan at 24 weeks (21.24 ± 8.30 days; P < 0.001) and 48 weeks (23.21 ± 8.42 days; P < 0.001) when compared with baseline (12.8 ± 6.0 days). Thalidomide increases the RBC lifespan and reduces hemolytic reactions in patients with β-thalassemia major. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier: ChiCTR1800015702."

    "title": "Plasma free hemoglobin is associated with LDH, AST, total bilirubin, reticulocyte count, and the hemolysis score in patients with sickle cell anemia.",
    "abstract": "Plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) is a direct biomarker for hemolysis that has been associated with clinical complications such as pulmonary hypertension and death in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We sought to characterize the relationship between PFH and more clinically available hemolytic markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, reticulocyte percentage and to derive a composite hemolysis score derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of these biomarkers. In 68 adult patients (median age 31 years old, IQR 25-39) with HbSS or HbSβ<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia enrolled in the IMPROVE II study, median PFH was elevated at 21.9 mg/dL (IQR 9.9-44.9 mg/dL) at steady state. Using Pearson correlation analysis, PFH had a stronger relationship to LDH (R = 0.699), AST (R = 0.587), and total bilirubin (R = 0.475), compared to reticulocyte count (R = 0.316). The hemolysis score was significantly associated with PFH (R = 0.677). When compared with other laboratory measures, PFH correlated with hemoglobin (R= -0.275) and HbS (R = 0.277), but did not correlate with white blood cell count (WBC) or HbF. The hemolysis score was significantly associated with WBC (R = 0.307), hemoglobin (R = -0.393), HbF (R=- 0.424), and HbS (R = 0.423). This study confirms that the conventional hemolytic biomarkers LDH, AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage correlate with PFH. Additionally, the hemolysis score is a valid tool to measure hemolysis and that it may be a marker of global hemolysis as opposed to PFH, which quantifies intravascular hemolysis. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of PFH and intravascular hemolysis in the development of clinical complications of sickle cell disease.

    "abstract": "Pulmonary complications frequently occur as comorbidities in individuals with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT). Despite their clinical significance, the existing literature lacks a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the prevalence and risk factors for pulmonary dysfunction in this patient cohort. Therefore, we propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report the prevalence and associated risk factors of pulmonary dysfunction in TDT patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science to identify English-language literature from the inception of each database up to 31 May 2024. We will include studies that involve TDT patients and report on the method of pulmonary function assessment, the proportion of pulmonary dysfunction and the analysis of risk factors for pulmonary dysfunction. The study designs included will be cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. Exclusions will apply to studies on non-TDT or patients with other diseases, reviews, case reports and animal experiments, as well as duplicated published studies, studies without full-text availability or studies from which raw data cannot be extracted. The screening process, including title, abstract and full texts, will be conducted independently by two reviewers. Data extraction will be performed following standardised protocols. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria. The meta-analysis will be conducted using Stata 14.0 and Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4 software, incorporating subgroup analyses, heterogeneity assessments and publication bias evaluations to ensure the robustness and reliability of the findings. As the data for this systematic review and meta-analysis are sourced exclusively from previously published literature, there is no requirement for ethical approval. The dissemination of the results will occur through publication in a peer-reviewed scholarly journal and presentations at relevant scientific conferences. CRD42024504353."

    "abstract": "Iron overload is a well-recognized complication in patients suffering from beta-thalassemia major (BTM) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), recently known as kidney failure (KF), particularly in those who receive frequent blood transfusions or long-term iron supplementation. The mechanisms leading to iron overload differ slightly between these two conditions, but the management principles share considerable overlap. Lessons learned from monitoring and managing iron overload in patients with BTM can provide valuable insights into managing iron overload in patients with KF. This narrative review explores the parallels between these two conditions concerning iron overload, emphasizing the importance of early detection, personalized therapy, multidisciplinary care, patient education, and preventive strategies."

    "abstract": "In severe heart failure with hemodynamic failure, when inotropic therapies no longer suffice (INTERMACS [Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support] 1), temporary mechanical support is used as a bridging measure until a more definitive treatment, such as a left ventricular assist device, a total artificial heart or transplantation, is performed. Due to shear stress during the passage of blood through the pump, limited hemolysis is to be expected. We describe the case of a 37-year-old patient with terminal heart failure who suffered severe hemolysis during treatment with temporary mechanical support. Examination of the cardiac apex after left ventricular assist device implantation revealed a poorly differentiated tumor. Histopathologic examination revealed underlying extramedullary hematopoiesis, triggered by severe hemolytic anemia. Following exclusion of neoplasia, the patient subsequently underwent heart transplantation. Post-transplantation, the patient was diagnosed with alpha-thalassemia and heterozygote hemoglobin E. This combination can result in mild thalassemia with chronic low-level hemolysis and mild anemia, probably severely exacerbated in the presence of high-shear stress."

    "abstract": "Bone marrow transplantation is an expensive treatment procedure that result in financial burdens. The aim of this study was to assess the financial burdens of this procedure from the caregiver's viewpoint. This cross-sectional study included pediatric patients (under 18 years old) who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation March 21, 2017, and March 21, 2019. A checklist was designed for interview and data collection. A comprehensive review of articles in PubMed, Embase and web of science and scientific texts was conducted. The checklist comprises 25 items, of which 11 pertain to the demographic characteristics of the patient's guardian, three items are dedicated to the child's medical condition, and remaining items focus on the financial implications of the transplant, such as its impact on employment and bank savings, selling or exchanging assets to cover costs, receiving charitable support, economizing on essential and non-essential expenses, borrowing money to cover transplant expenses, and downgrading one's standard of living to afford the transplant. A total of 257 caregivers of pediatric patients who were underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were interviewed. The majority of respondents (92%) were parents of patients. The predominant type of HCT among patients was allogeneic (82.9%). Patients underwent HCT for 17 different diseases, with the most common being thalassemia (18.7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (16.7%). About 18% of the respondents stated that they had to take leave from work to pursue transplantation for their patients. Additionally, 19.5% of the participants reported that they had to work part-time due to the demands of the treatment process, while about 18% were completely unemployed in order to follow the treatment process of their patients. 92% of caregivers were forced to spend all of their bank savings to cover HCT expenses. Furthermore, 67% of respondents stated that they were forced to sell their assets to cover HCT expenses, with gold and jewelry being the most commonly sold assets by households (38.5% or 99 people). Despite the lower cost of bone marrow transplantation in Iran compared to developed countries, the purchasing power of people and the insurance coverage should be taken into account. This study revealed that the financial burden on Iranian caregivers is substantial and leads to severe economic impacts and deterioration of households' quality of life. Therefore, policy and insurance reforms are needed to improve the situation of bone marrow transplantations."

    "abstract": "To elucidate the molecular basis, hematological features, and electrophoretic and chromatographic mobility behavior of an unstable α<sub>2</sub>-globin chain variant, and to describe the diagnostic approach. A Thai patient with unexplained chronic anemia and her daughter were investigated. Hematological data were analyzed using a standard automated cell counter. Hemoglobin was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Mutational analysis was performed using appropriate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and direct sequencing. Additionally, α-globin haplotype analysis was conducted. Simple and rapid diagnostic methods were developed. Hemoglobin analysis in the patient revealed anomalous peaks separated from normal hemoglobin visible using the HPLC technique. These peaks were virtually absent in the daughter. DNA analysis identified a G to C mutation at codon 14 of the α<sub>2</sub>-globin gene responsible for hemoglobin Jax in trans to the α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia gene in the patient. Heterozygosity of this mutation was identified in her daughter. Hematological analysis showed mild thalassemia-like changes in simple heterozygotes and exhibited a hemoglobin H-like phenotype when combined with α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia. Isopropanol stability testing and bioinformatic software indicated that the variant was unstable and potentially damaging. This mutation was confirmed using allele-specific PCR. Hemoglobin Jax was strongly associated with the haplotype [+ - S + - + -]. Hemoglobin Jax, a pathological α-globin variant, is asymptomatic in simple heterozygotes and demonstrates more pronounced clinical effects when associated with deletional α-thalassemia. This knowledge can help develop strategies to prevent hemoglobinopathies in regions of high prevalence. Accurate identification requires DNA level analysis."

    "abstract": "Placental chorioangioma is a benign tumour of the placenta. In most cases, chorioangiomas are small and do not result in maternal or fetal complications. This report presents a case with a large placental chorioangioma, which was associated with an intrapartum event leading to significant maternal and perinatal morbidity. A case of placental chorioangioma was diagnosed at 29 + 1 weeks of gestation. As the tumour enlarged progressively with polyhydramnios, further ultrasound examination indicated signs of fetal hydrops. Following multi-disciplinary team discussion, caesarean section was performed with delivery of a female infant. Pathological examination of the placenta confirmed an infarcted chorioangioma. Placental chorioangiomas are benign, non-trophoblastic vascular neoplasms. While often asymptomatic, they can occasionally have unfavourable outcomes. Ultrasound examination plays a critical role in their diagnosis and monitoring. These neoplasms exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations, leading to their classification as a spectrum of symptoms rather than a distinct syndrome. Early diagnosis, vigilant prenatal surveillance, and timely intervention are essential to minimize fetal morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Mammalian epididymal epithelial cells are crucial for sperm maturation. Historically, vacuole-like ultrastructures in epididymal epithelial cells were observed via transmission electron microscopy but were undefined. Here, we utilize volume electron microscopy (vEM) to generate 3D reconstructions of epididymal epithelial cells and identify these vacuoles as intercellular organelle reservoirs (IORs) in the lateral intercellular space (LIS), which contains protein aggregates, autophagosomes, lysosome-related organelles and mitochondrial residues. Immunolabelling of organelle markers such as P62, LC3, LAMP1 and TOMM20 confirm these findings. The IOR size or number varies across four epididymal regions and decreases with age. Rab27a mutant mice exhibit reduced IORs in the caput epididymis and a subfertility phenotype, suggesting the involvement of Rab27a in the formation of IORs. Furthermore, we observe the presence of IORs between intestinal epithelial cells besides epididymis. Amino acid transporters at IOR edges suggest dynamic protein recycling. Our findings reveal that the IOR is an important structure critical for organelle turnover and recycling outside epithelial cells with limited self-degradation capabilities."

    "abstract": "Functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) represent a subset of PanNETs that cause symptoms due to hormonal activity. Insulinoma is the most common functioning PanNET type. Mutations in the alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) and death domain-associated protein (DAXX) genes result in genomic instability. ATRX/DAXX mutations and associated alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) are common in non-functioning PanNETs and associated with aggressive tumor behavior. Recent reports have shown that ATRX/DAXX mutations and ALT are also present in functioning PanNETs. In this review, we summarize the literature addressing ATRX/DAXX mutations and ALT in functioning PanNETs and discuss the clinical relevance with regard to distinguishing aggressive and indolent functioning tumors. ATRX/DAXX gene mutations and/or ALT have been reported in insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma and calcitoninoma. In insulinoma, the presence of ATRX/DAXX mutations and ALT are associated with aggressive behavior and could therefore be used as prognostic biomarkers. Although ATRX/DAXX mutation and ALT assessment may currently not be the standard of care in routine diagnostic pathology practice, the use of DAXX/ATRX immunohistochemistry at least can be encouraged not only for non-functioning but also for functioning PanNETs."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the pattern of lung impairment using various pulmonary tests and the effects of transfusion on pulmonary functions in patients with TM. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The study was performed on patients 9-21 years of age prospectively. Spirometric tests, plethysmography, and CO diffusion tests were performed before and 2 h after erythrocyte transfusion. Patients also underwent a methacholine stimulation test 2 h after transfusion. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 37 patients with TM were included in the study. There was no change in pretransfusion and post-transfusion spirometric test results. Plethysmographic tests revealed that both the median total lung capacity and the mean vital capacity values have decreased after transfusion. Medians of pretransfusion DLCO values significantly increased after transfusion. There was an impairment in diffusion in 16 (44.4%) patients, whereas it improved in 9 patients after transfusion. Bronchial hyperreactivity was detected in 10 out of 27 patients (37%) via methacholine stimulation test.

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease and β-Thalassemia are two of the most prevalent hemoglobinopathies worldwide. Both occur due to genetic mutations within the HBB gene and are characterized by red blood cell dysfunction, anemia, and end-organ injury. The spleen and liver are the primary organs where erythrophagocytosis, engulfing the red blood cells, occurs in these diseases. Understanding metabolism and protein composition within these tissues can therefore inform the extent of hemolysis and disease progression. We utilized a multiomics approach to highlight metabolomic and proteomic differences in the spleen and liver. The Berkley sickle cell disease (Berk-SS), heterozygous B1/B2 globin gene deletion (Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup>) a known β-Thalassemia model, and wildtype (WT, C57/Bl6) murine models were evaluated in this report. This analysis showed Berk-SS and Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup> shared distinct antioxidant and immunosuppressive splenic phenotypes compared to WT mice with divergence in purine metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis. In contrast, Berk-SS mice have a distinct liver pro-inflammatory phenotype not shared by Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup> or WT mice. Together, these data emphasize that metabolic and proteomic reprogramming of the spleen and livers in Berk-SS and Hbb<sup>Th3/+</sup>mice may be relevant to the individual disease processes."

Here, we report long-term follow-up data from the phase 3 BELIEVE trial of luspatercept for transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia. BELIEVE was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed at 65 sites in 15 countries. The trial included adults with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia or haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using integrated response technology stratified by region to luspatercept (1·0-1·25 mg/kg) or placebo administered subcutaneously once every 21 days. After study unblinding, patients could receive luspatercept in the open-label extension phase (crossover allowed). The primary endpoint results (proportion of patients with reduction in transfusion burden of ≥33% and ≥2 RBC units during weeks 13-24) are described elsewhere; herein we present an update to the primary endpoint analysis consequent to late-reported transfusion events. We also report long-term efficacy (intention-to-treat population) and safety data (safety population) for patients followed up for approximately 3 years. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02604433) and is completed. Between May 2, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 336 patients were randomly assigned to luspatercept (n=224) or placebo (n=112). The median age of patients was 30 years (IQR 23-40); 195 (58%) were female and 141 (42%) male. As of Jan 5, 2021, the median duration of treatment in the luspatercept group was 153·6 weeks (IQR 81·0-171·0) and median study follow-up was 163·1 weeks (140·5-176·2). Due to the difference in treatment duration between the luspatercept and placebo groups, no comparative analyses between the two groups were performed after week 96. Patients in the luspatercept group showed a sustained reduction in RBC transfusion burden from baseline through week 192, with mean decreases of 6·2 RBC units (SD 5·7) during weeks 97-144 and 6·4 RBC units (4·3) during weeks 145-192. In the luspatercept group, a 33% or greater reduction in transfusion burden from baseline was observed in 173 (77%) patients over any 12-week interval and in 116 (52%) patients over any 24-week interval. The median total duration of 33% or greater transfusion burden reduction response during any period of at least 12 weeks was 586·0 days (IQR 264·0-1010·0). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) among all patients who received luspatercept (n=315, including 92 patients who crossed over after study unblinding) were anaemia (nine [3%]), increased liver iron concentration (seven [2%]), and bone pain (seven [2%]); serious TEAEs occurred in 71 (23%) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred in any group during the study. These long-term results affirm luspatercept's efficacy in addressing key unmet needs of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia with a manageable safety profile.

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a formidable blood cancer, despite recent advances in treatment. A significant challenge persists in improving patient outcomes, particularly in addressing relapse and treatment resistance. Identifying new therapeutic targets is critical for advancing AML therapy. C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in AML. This cell surface receptor is highly expressed on AML blasts and demonstrates stable expression throughout disease progression. CLL-1's consistent presence makes it an ideal candidate for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD), which is a critical indicator for predicting relapse. Beyond its utility as a diagnostic marker, CLL-1 offers exciting potential in the development of immunotherapies. Emerging strategies, such as CAR-T-cell therapy and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are being investigated to leverage the immune system against CLL-1-expressing AML cells. This review examines the structure, function, and expression patterns of CLL-1 in AML and other hematologic malignancies, providing insights into its role in disease pathogenesis and treatment potential. Exploring CLL-1 as a target for diagnosis, MRD monitoring, and immunotherapy opens new avenues for AML treatment. A deeper understanding of its relationship with AML pathogenesis will aid in the development of targeted therapies, offering hope for improved patient outcomes in the future."

Ineffective erythropoiesis, also termed dyserythropoiesis, is a process by which erythroid precursors die or fail to efficiently differentiate in the bone marrow. Ineffective erythropoiesis is characterized by expanded bone marrow erythropoiesis and increased erythroferrone production by bone marrow erythroblasts, with the latter resulting in reduced hepcidin production and increased iron absorption. Ineffective erythropoiesis may result from acquired and congenital conditions. Inherited causes of ineffective erythropoiesis include β-thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemias.

This was a retrospective study on the analysis of the data for 15 patients who had graft failure over an 18-year period (March 2000 to March 2017) at our institution. For the first failed transplants for patients who had a myeloablative regimen consisting of busulfan (BU)-CY with or without additional anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), the median age at transplant was 4.2 years. Graft failure occurred over a median of 8.6 months (range, 0.6 - 74.3 months) after the first transplant. The median time to the second transplant from GR was 25.3 months. For the second transplant, the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match-related donors for the first HSCT were used. Over half of the patients had moderate to severe iron overload with pre-transplant serum ferritin of 1,405 to 4,051 µg/L at transplant. Thirteen patients (86.7%) engrafted with thalassemia-free survival (TFS) of 80.0%. One patient rejected the graft and died. Another died due to infectious complications. Apart from a mild chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in one patient, no serious complications were observed. CY-TBI can be used as conditioning for second HSCT in patients with TDT GR following myeloablative conditioning. We observed overall survival and TFS of 87% and 80% respectively with low rejection rate and mortality, and limited long-term side effects."

    "abstract": "Four multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs) are important enhancers which affect α-globin expression. Deletions of MCS can cause α-thalassemia. So far, duplication of MCS has never been reported to account for thalassemia. In this study, an unusual transfusion-dependent case of hemoglobin H disease was identified by whole-genome sequencing, optical genome mapping and longer PCR with special primers, which was caused by a familial 96,620-bp inverted duplication (from MCS-R1 to MCS-R4), inserted between chr16:199348 and 199349 (GRCh37/hg19) within MCSs. The duplication segment included an inverted repeat sequence from chr16:102712 to176193 and one direct repeat sequence from chr16:176208 to 199348. The associated α-thalassemia trait was confirmed to result from disrupted topological chromatin domains using ATAC-seq and the dual‑luciferase reporter assay system. This case presents a new mechanism of α-thalassemia, and may aid our understanding of the effects of enhancers on gene expression and the differential contribution of the four enhancer elements in the human a-globin locus."

    "abstract": "This clinical study evaluates the bioequivalence of recombinant factor VIII with Fc fusion protein (rFVIII-Fc) developed by AryoGen Pharmed Company compared to the reference product, Elocta<sup>®</sup> by Sobi Co., in severe haemophilia A patients. Fc-fused recombinant factor VIII represents a significant advancement in haemophilia A treatment, offering extended half-life and reduced infusion frequency, thus improving patients' adherence to treatment and quality of life. In a randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover trial, 50 Iranian patients were assigned to treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects received both the test and the reference product with a 7-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetic assessments were conducted over five days post-administration to evaluate the primary outcome, the dose-normalized area under the curve (DNAUC). The results established bioequivalence between rFVIII-Fc (AryoGen Pharmed Company) and Elocta<sup>®</sup>, based on the DNAUC as the primary outcome, in which the ratio of test and reference products was calculated to be 108.56 (90% confidence interval 104.88 to 112.37), falling within the pre-defined equivalence margin of 80-125%. Secondary outcomes, including area under the curve (AUC<sub>inf</sub>), maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and half-life, further supported bioequivalence. Safety profiles were comparable, with adverse events mainly related to haemophilia A rather than the intervention. In conclusion, the rFVIII-Fc product is bioequivalent to Elocta<sup>®</sup> with a similar safety profile, offering an effective alternative for severe haemophilia A patients. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06137092)."

    "abstract": "The human hemoglobin subunit μ (Hb-μ) has been identified as a potential biomarker for α-thalassemia. However, little structural and functional information is available for this subunit. Here, we have overexpressed and purified a double mutant of C49S/C104S Hb-μ and solved its X-ray crystal structure. It adopts a typical protein fold of the globins, similar to that of the α-subunit. The structure also reveals that the protein undergoes self-oxidation of Met62 in the heme distal site, producing the form of sulfoxide (Met-SO). The property and function have also been studied by spectroscopy, which shows that the protein has considerable peroxidase activity due to the presence of a catalytic His-Arg pair in the heme distal site. The structure-function relationship of Hb-μ obtained in this study may provide useful insights into Hb-related diseases."

Two mechanisms are responsible for iron overload in β-thalassemia: increased iron absorption due to ineffective erythropoiesis and blood transfusions. This review examines the mechanisms of myocardial injury caused by cardiac iron overload and role of various clinical examination techniques in assessing cardiac iron burden and functional impairment. Early identification and intervention for cardiac injury and iron overload in β-thalassemia have the potential to prevent and reverse or delay its progression in the early stages, playing a crucial role in its prognosis."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the costs and benefits of genetic testing, specifically mutation analysis and prenatal diagnostic testing, for the confirmation of thalassemia in at-risk pregnancies in Thailand, providing crucial insights to inform public health policy decision-making. We analyzed the costs and benefits of following standard screening guidelines, which included a sequence of tests such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV)/mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) with dichlorophenol indophenol precipitation (DCIP), hemoglobin (Hb) typing, genetic testing, and amniocentesis. A decision-tree model was employed for this analysis. The study compared the scenarios with and without genetic testing, adopting a societal perspective that accounted for costs during pregnancy and the lifetime of a child born with thalassemia. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainties in the parameters used. The results revealed that adhering to the standard screening program with genetic testing resulted in a cost-savings of approximately 490 USD per prevented thalassemia case. Among the diagnostic methods, the specificity of the MCV/MCH with DCIP showed a higher degree of sensitivity relative to other testing methods, significantly influencing the outcomes. From a governmental perspective, with a full uptake of genetic testing, the incremental budget required was estimated to be 3.7 million USD (131 million THB) for one year. These findings are particularly valuable for policymakers, as they provide robust evidence supporting potential revisions to the reimbursement structure within Thailand's Universal Health Coverage benefit package, facilitating better management of thalassemia and improving prenatal care."

    "abstract": "Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F, α2γ2) has been demonstrated to be a therapeutic strategy for patients with β-hemoglobinopathies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by silencing RNA. Both coding and non-coding RNAs can compete for the same miRNAs, acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, the role of ceRNAs in β-thalassemia major (β-TM) and their impact on γ-globin expression remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted transcriptome sequencing to collect circularRNA (circRNA), miRNA, and mRNAs from β-TM patients and healthy individuals. Through bioinformatics analysis, we constructed a GATA2‑associated ceRNA network, emphasizing the hsa_circ_0005245_hsa-miR-425-3p_GATA2 pathway. Validation using qRT-PCR analysis in β-TM samples, RNA immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed this pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of hsa_circ_0005245, hsa-miR-425-3p, and GATA2 in HUDEP-2 cells individually resulted in elevated γ-globin levels. Our findings identify a novel hsa_circ_0005245_hsa-miR-425-3p_GATA2 pathway that regulates γ-globin expression, providing potential insights for the clinical management of β-TM patients."

    "abstract": "Heterozygous β-globin gene knockout thalassemia (BKO) mice derived from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice have phenotypic of β-thalassemia (BT) and have been widely used for studying this disease except reproductive disorders. The present study determined whether male BKO mice recapitulate reproductive problems as BT men. Mice were randomly assigned into groups depending on the genotype (WT vs. BKO) and intervention (control vs. iron-loaded). Euthanized mice were collected blood, testes, epididymides, hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary for assessing hematological parameters, plasma iron and testosterone levels, testis iron levels, sperm characteristics, and histological alterations. Iron administration caused significant increases of plasma and testis iron levels (p < 0.001) but had no significant influence on the hematological profile of BKO mice, which indeed had fewer erythrocyte, hemoglobin, and hematocrit but had greater reticulocyte than WT (p < 0.001 to p = 0.017). Furthermore, irrespective of the genotype, iron administration decreased plasma testosterone levels (p = 0.03 to p > 0.05), total sperm count (p < 0.001), and percent normal sperm morphology (p ≤ 0.01). Based on Perls' Prussian blue staining, excess iron was ubiquitously present in the anterior pituitary and testicular interstitium of iron-loaded mice. This mineral, however, caused no significant changes in reproductive organs microstructure as visualized by hematoxylin and eosin staining. In conclusion, besides physiological dysfunction of many organ systems, iron-loaded male BKO mice exhibit reproductive problems and abnormal sperm characteristics similar to BT men. Therefore, this animal model seems invaluable for future biomedical research involved in various aspects of BT-related male reproductive disorders."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is a type of protein aggregation disease. Its clinical heterogeneity imposes challenges in effective management. Red blood cell (RBC) variables may be clinically relevant as mechanistic parts or tellers of TDT pathophysiology. This is a cross-sectional study of RBC and plasma physiology in adult patients with TDT vs healthy control. TDT plasma was characterized by increased protein carbonylation, antioxidants, and larger than normal extracellular vesicles. RBCs were osmotically resistant but prone to oxidative hemolysis. They overexposed phosphatidylserine and exhibited pathologically low proteasome proteolytic activity (PPA), which correlated with metabolic markers of the disease. RBC ultrastructure was distorted, with splenectomy-related membrane pits of 300 to 800 nm. Plasma metabolomics revealed differences in heme metabolism, redox potential, short-chain fatty acids, and nitric oxide bioavailability, but also in catecholamine pathways. According to coefficient of variation assessment, hemolysis, iron homeostasis, PPA, and phosphatidylserine exposure were highly variable among patients, as opposed to RBC fragility and plasma antioxidants, amino acids, and catecholamines. Sex-based differences were detected in hemolysis, redox, and energy variables, whereas splenectomy-related differences referred to thrombotic risk, RBC morphology, and plasma metabolites with neuroendocrine activity. Hepcidin varied according to oxidative hemolysis and metabolic markers of bacterial activity. Patients with higher pretransfusion hemoglobin levels (>10 g/dL) presented mildly distorted profiles and lower membrane-associated PPA, whereas classification by severity of mutations revealed different levels of hemostasis, inflammation, plasma epinephrine, hexosamines, and methyltransferase activity markers. The currently reported heterogeneity of cellular and biochemical features probably contributes to the wide phenotypic diversity of TDT at clinical level."

We included 292 β-TM patients (151 females, 36.72 ± 11.76 years) consecutively enrolled in the Extension-Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia project and 20 healthy controls (8 females, 36.97 ± 3.54 years). CMR was used to assess FAC and derive LV systolic and diastolic indexes, to quantify myocardial iron overload (MIO) by the T2* technique and LV volumes and ejection fraction, and to detect late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Healthy subjects and β-TM patients showed comparable LV systolic and diastolic indexes. In β-TM, the LV systolic index was significantly correlated with global heart T2* values, and patients with significant MIO (T2*<20ms) were more likely to have a reduced LV systolic index compared to those without MIO (odds ratio-OR = 3.13; p = 0.013). In multivariate analysis, global heart T2* values and positive LGE emerged as independent determinants of the LV systolic index. The number of segments with LGE inversely correlated with the LV systolic index (p = 0.003). Patients with a reduced LV systolic index were more likely to have cardiac diseases than those with a normal LV systolic index (OR = 5.34; p < 0.0001). No significant correlates were found for the LV diastolic index. In well-treated β-TM patients, MIO and LGE were the strongest determinants of the LV systolic index, and a reduced LV systolic index was associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications."

The paper aims to develop a novel discrete truncation method to measure cardiac T2* value in patients with thalassemia. The cardiac T2* values of 349 thalassemia (TM) patients (mean age, 13.41 years ±8.761, 173 males) from three hospitals during January 2011 to June 2023 were measured by CMRtools software. Different truncation methods were used to remove signal values that deviated from the fitting curve and the corresponding T2* values were recorded. The difference, correlation and consistency of DB-T2* and BB-T2* measured by different methods were compared. There was no significant difference between DB-T2* and BB-T2* measured by discrete truncation method (DB-T2* vs.BB-T2*, <i>p</i> = 0.249), respectively; and there was a high positive correlation (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.997, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). In the Bland-Altman analysis, the two methods had a very good agreement (<i>p</i> = 0.2489). There was a high positive correlation between DB-T2* and BB-T2* measured by the automatic truncation method (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.974, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), but there was a significant difference between them (DB-T2* vs.BB-T2*, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), respectively. In the Bland-Altman analysis, there was no good agreement between the two methods (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The discrete truncation method is more stable and reliable than the automatic truncation method in the measurement of cardiac T2* value in TM patients."

The average Mentzer index levels were found to be 12.95±4.56. Places of birth are Mediterranean with 8.3% and other regions with 91.7%. β-thalassemia type detected in family medicine was suspected with a rate of 1.5% and carrier with a rate of 0.6%. The rate of patients referred to a hematologist was found to be 2.1%. The rate of patients with a definitive diagnosis was determined as 1.8%. It was determined that β-thalassemia definitive diagnosis rates were higher in groups whose place of birth was the Mediterranean region, with a family history of thalassemia, with a diagnosis of cancer, and with a genetic, allergic, and chronic disease diagnosis (p=0.01). Although it is not located in the Mediterranean region, the high prevalence of β-thalassemia in our population and its relationship with diseases are important.

    "abstract": "Nonspecific interactions are ubiquitous and important in biology; however, they are rarely valued or employed in the field of clinical disease diagnosis. Relying on nonspecific cross-interactions, sensor arrays have shown great potential in distinguishing mixtures or nuanced compounds. However, developing generic strategies for constructing effective arrays tailored to compositionally complicated and highly individualized clinical biospecimens remains challenging. Here, we introduce a combinatorial chemistry-screened array strategy, leveraging four-component Ugi reactions to achieve the rapid synthesis of hundreds of structurally diverse sensing elements. Moreover, effective sensor arrays can thus be built by rapidly screening sensors against diverse analytes. Next, we demonstrate the practical applicability of this array by clinical sperm quality assessment, given the current lack of well-established clinical rapid detection techniques. A library of 192 structurally diverse sensor elements was synthesized. Following screening, a pruned 14-element array was successfully constructed, achieving 94.2% accuracy in distinguishing between healthy individuals and four types of abnormal sperm samples from patients within 1 min. This universal strategy avoids complex sensor design and greatly improves the efficiency of sensor array construction, offering a new way of designing effective arrays."

We present our experience of antenatal thalassemia screening and prenatal diagnosis (PND) in a tertiary care teaching hospital. All antenatal women presenting to the antenatal clinic over 6 years were counseled for beta thalassemia screening. If the lady was detected heterozygous for thalassemia/hemoglobinopathy, partner screening was advised. If the husband was also detected to be heterozygous, the risk couple was offered prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus tissue DNA analysis. A total of 5392 antenatal women were counseled for beta thalassemia screening, with compliance in 4376 (81.1%) cases. Beta Thalassemia heterozygosity was detected in 147(3.4%) cases, borderline HbA2 in 75(1.7%) and other hemoglobin variants in 91(2.1%). Partner screening was advised in 313 (7.1%) affected antenatal women, with non-compliance in 33.8% cases. Of 27 risk couples identified, prenatal diagnosis was done in 19 couples, detecting 3 affected fetuses. In 8 couples, PND could not be done because of late gestation, financial constraints, lost follow up, failed CVS tissue aspiration and miscarriage prior to CVS tissue biopsy. Late presentation to the antenatal clinic, non-compliance to screening advice and financial constraints could be the factors impeding the thalassemia control program. This emphasizes on the need for community level awareness and inclusion of Thalassemia screening and prenatal diagnosis in the healthcare system."

To ensure appropriate medical management and social support, it is important that these children are enrolled in a proper day care centre led by a haematologist or trained paediatrician. This study assesses the impact of dedicated thalassemia day care services in lives of patients with thalassemia. Retrospective analysis of qualitative and quantitative data of children in Thalassemia Day care centre (established in March 2020) of a Pediatric hospital in Mumbai, India was done. A team comprising of hematologist, counselor, staff nurses, social worker, porters and blood bank technician was appointed. A total of 88 children with Thalassemia who were initially taking treatment in general wards were enrolled. Transfusion guidelines to maintain pre-transfusion hemoglobin between 9 and 10.5 g/dl were prepared. Better hematocrit of blood, fresh blood and leucodepletion filters were provided to all. Iron overload status was checked by serum ferritin and T2* MRI periodically and chelation optimized. Steps to strengthen primary and secondary prevention of thalassemia were taken. NGOs were engaged to assist patients socially and financially. Thalassemia day care centre (TDC) started in March 2020 with 88 registrations and as of March 2023, we are supporting 157 patients. Baseline pre-transfusion Hb was available for only 64/88 (72%) and ferritin levels in 62/88 (70%) patients prior to TDC as rest were not following up with hematologist. Amongst 66 patients, pre transfusion hemoglobin improved from mean of 8.2 g/dl (6.5-10.6 g/dl) (pre TDC) to 9.5 g/dl (8-10.6 g/dl) (post TDC). No patient has acquired a blood transmitted viral infection in these 3 years. Mean serum ferritin levels were 3285 ng/ml amongst 63 patients pre TDC and 3870 ng/ml amongst 88 patients post 3 years of TDC. HLA typing camps helped us in identifying 14 sibling matches, out of which 9 underwent successful Bone marrow transplant. As primary prevention strategy, 201 anemic pregnant females were screened and 8 carrier mothers were identified. For secondary prevention, 15 couples underwent antenatal screening to prevent birth of a child with thalassemia. Team also ensured psychosocial well-being of families, which is reflected in the positive feedback given by patients post 3 years of day care. Seven CMEs or awareness programs have been conducted by the team to spread awareness. With a dedicated centre, we are now able to provide appropriate healthcare to patients which has helped in improving their hemoglobin as well as iron overload status. Children and families now have a more friendly and comfortable environment for taking transfusions."

Knowledge was significantly higher among university-educated participants (p < 0.001). While attitudes were generally positive across demographics, older participants (26-44 years) exhibited significantly more positive attitudes than those aged 18-25 (p = 0.008). There is strong support for PMS (94.7%) and public awareness initiatives (>99%) but less agreement on marrying someone with the same genetic trait (62.5%) and less consensus on the significance of seminars (20.8%). Health college students at Qassim University have a strong understanding of PMS for hemoglobinopathies, with educational level influencing knowledge depth and attitudes. The findings indicate that additional educational programs, notably on the significance of screening in lowering genetic transmission risks, are needed. Raising public awareness through targeted seminars and media initiatives may improve the acceptability and understanding of PMS."

    "title": "Hepatic and renal functions of paediatric patients with thalassaemia: a cross-sectional study from two large thalassaemia centres in Sri Lanka.",
    "abstract": "Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of haemoglobin synthesis characterised by life-long chronic anaemia. Although the endocrine and cardiac complications of thalassaemia are well-studied, hepatic and renal complications are understudied. This study aims to describe the hepatic and renal functions and to understand their determinants among paediatric patients with β-thalassaemia. Cross-sectional study. Two largest thalassaemia centres in Sri Lanka. All haematologically confirmed patients with β-thalassaemia aged 1-16 years attending the study sites were recruited between 1 January and 31 March 2023. Data were collected by interviewing parents and patients, performing physical examinations and perusing clinical records. 72 children (girls 52.8%) were recruited. The mean age was 7.3 years (SD 3.8). A majority (44 (61.1%)) had β-thalassaemia major, while 22 (30.6%) had haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia. 55 children (76.4%) were transfusion dependent. Hepatomegaly was found in 47 (65.3%), while 28 (38.9%) had elevations of both alanine and aspartate transaminases. Haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia type (OR 13.6, 95% CI 2.0 to 92, p=0.008) and high ferritin above 1000 ng/mL (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 38, p=0.047) were independent factors associated with high transaminases. 11 (15.5%) patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 90 mL/min. The proportion of children with low eGFR was higher in β-thalassaemia major (23.3%), transfusion-dependent (18.5%) and deferasirox treatment (18.5%) groups. Elevation of hepatic transaminases is common among children with thalassaemia, especially among the subset of patients with haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia and those with high ferritin. Milder reductions in eGFR are noted in some patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia major."

Simple and rapid identification of α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia carrier and prenatal diagnosis of Hemoglobin Bart's hydrops is essential in the region. We have developed a multiplex RPA assay for simple detection of α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia (SEA and THAI deletions) and tested it in carrier detection (<i>n</i> = 125) and prenatal diagnosis of Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome (<i>n</i> = 30). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia carriers were 100% for both SEA and THAI deletions. The assay correctly identified 42 carriers of α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia (SEA deletion), 4 carriers of α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia (THAI deletion), and 79 non-carriers. For prenatal diagnosis, the results of RPA revealed a 100% concordance (30/30) with the conventional gap-PCR analysis. The multiplex RPA assay is a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective method for diagnosing α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia-related disorders in routine clinical settings. This assay has the potential to significantly contribute to the prevention and control of Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis in the region."

This study analyzed adverse events (AEs) linked to luspatercept using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) with data mining techniques. We collected and analyzed luspatercept-related reports from the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2024. Disproportionality analysis was used in data mining to quantify luspatercept-related AE signals. A total of 46 AE signals were detected in 13 SOCs (system organ classes). In addition to the AEs identified during the clinical trial stage, this study also identified some unexpected and important AEs, such as product preparation error, prescribed overdose, product preparation issue, prescribed underdose, and acute hepatitis. Our study provides a comprehensive description of the post-marketing safety of luspatercept and identifies new potential AEs. Healthcare workers must be vigilant in avoiding product preparation errors, an adverse event that highlights the need for enhanced training and the participation of pharmacists in assessing medication utilization scenarios."

    "abstract": "Low bone mass, defined as a bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score ≤-2.0, is common in adults with thalassemia (Thal) and sickle cell disease (SCD), though disease-specific artifacts may contribute to inaccuracies in BMD assessment. Trabecular bone score (TBS), an indicator of bone quality, is not susceptible to these challenges and may improve fracture risk prediction. A retrospective chart review was conducted in patients with Thal or SCD who had at least one spine BMD scan by DXA in the past 10 years. The most recent scan was reanalyzed for bone quality with abnormal defined as TBS <1.2. Fracture prevalence was determined by patient report with medical record validation. Patients were compared to healthy controls who participated in previous research. Data were abstracted from 126 patients with Thal (31.7 ± 11.9 yrs, 51 % Male), 170 with SCD (24.6 ± 13.5 yrs, 43 % Male), and 64 controls (25.9 ± 8.0 yrs, 17 % Male). Abnormal TBS was more common in Thal (26 %) or SCD (7 %) compared to controls (0 %, p < 0.001). Fracture prevalence was greater in Thal (36 %) compared to SCD (23 %) and controls (16 %, p = 0.005). Fragility fractures were not observed in controls but constituted 21 % of fractures in Thal and 15 % in SCD. After adjusting for age and hypogonadism, low bone mass was associated with an increased fracture prevalence (OR: 1.8, 95 % CI: 1.03, 3.23; p = 0.041), but not with fragility fracture. In contrast, abnormal TBS was strongly associated with fragility fracture after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI (OR: 11.4, 95 % CI: 2.2, 59.1, p = 0.004). Bone quality by TBS may be a valuable tool in predicting the risk of fragility fractures in young adults with hemoglobinopathies and should be considered when making decisions for anti-resorptive therapy in those with low BMD naive to fracture or where disease-specific artifacts complicate accurate spine assessment by BMD alone."

    "abstract": "Most patients with colorectal cancer do not achieve durable clinical benefits from immunotherapy, underscoring the existence of alternative immunosuppressive mechanisms. Here we found that activation of the lactate receptor HCAR1 signaling pathway induced the expression of chemokines CCL2 and CCL7 in colorectal tumor cells, leading to the recruitment of immunosuppressive CCR2<sup>+</sup> polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) to the tumor microenvironment. Ablation of Hcar1 in mice with colorectal tumors significantly decreased the abundance of tumor-infiltrating CCR2<sup>+</sup> PMN-MDSCs, enhanced the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and, consequently, reduced tumor burden. We detected immunosuppressive CCR2<sup>+</sup> PMN-MDSCs in tumor specimens from individuals with colorectal and other cancers. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug reserpine suppressed lactate-mediated HCAR1 activation, impaired the recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> PMN-MDSCs, boosted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent antitumor immunity and sensitized immunotherapy-resistant tumors to programmed cell death protein 1 antibody therapy in mice with colorectal tumors. Altogether, we described HCAR1-driven recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> PMN-MDSCs as a mechanism of immunosuppression."

    "abstract": "This study explores the complex mechanisms between Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and cellular senescence, with a focus on the role of four key genes (MMP1, CCL7, CXCL1, HK3) identified through transcriptome analysis in the GEO database. These genes are closely related to IL-17 signalling and the pathogenesis of RA. In a macrophage senescence model induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and bleomycin (BLM), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot confirmed the significant upregulation of these genes and an increase in the secretion of the cytokine IL-17, which promotes an inflammatory environment for the polarization of macrophages to M1. When co-cultured with mouse synovial fibroblasts (MSF), MSF showed enhanced vitality and increased invasiveness, indicating a key role for these genes in the progression of RA. Additionally, HK3, less reported in RA, when its expression is knocking down, lactate secretion and lactylation modification at lysine 14 of histone H3 in macrophages were reduced, leading to a change in macrophage polarity. The study concludes that the altered polarity of senescent macrophages drives the proliferation and invasion of MSF, significantly promoting the development of RA and providing insights into the pathophysiology of RA."

An infertile female presenting with primary amenorrhea was recruited. Comprehensive genetic evaluation including SRY and AZF gene testing, chromosome karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), CNV-seq, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. This patient was treated with HRT and oocyte donation and received appropriate treatment during pregnancy. The patient showed a hypoplastic uterus and absent bilateral ovaries via ultrasound detection. She was identified to be a 45,X/46,XY mosaicism through CNV-seq analysis of peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and buccal cells. And further gonadal pathology further confirmed a diagnosis of CGD. Following successful management of multiple pregnancy complications, she delivered a healthy full-term infant. This is the second case around the world and the first case in China of 45,X/46,XY mosaic female with CGD who experienced a successful pregnancy via occytes donation.And we provided a detailed examination and treatment process for a series of complications in this case, especially the management of threatened miscarriages and preterm labour."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia (thal), hemoglobin (Hb) E, and high Hb F determinants, which are caused by mutations in the β-globin gene cluster, are common genetic disorders in Thailand and Southeast Asia. Prenatal diagnosis is essential for couples at risk to identify severe forms, including homozygous β-thal and Hb E/β-thal. Conventional methods, including reverse dot-blot hybridization and gap-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genotyping of point and large deletion mutations, require post-PCR steps, which are time-consuming and costly. This study aimed to develop a rapid and efficient method using monoplex high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for genotyping of Hb E and 11 β-thal mutations; multiplex HRM analysis for identifying six deletional mutations, including two β<sup>0</sup>-thal mutations (3.5 and 45 kb deletion); and a novel method for detecting four high Hb F determinants, namely, δβ<sup>0</sup>-thal (12.5 kb deletion), HPFH6, Indian inv-del (<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup>-thal, and Thai del-inv-ins (<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup>-thal. The developed assays were validated using 182 blinded fetal DNA samples with 41 β-thal genotypes. Different HRM patterns were observed among wild-type, heterozygote, homozygote, and compound heterozygote genotypes. Six deletional mutations showed specific melt curves. This technique demonstrated 100% concordance with conventional methods. The assay showed 100% sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values within the limit of detection at DNA concentrations of 8.0 ng/reaction. Finally, this developed assay was efficient in identifying both point mutations and large deletion, convenient, rapid, and cost-effective and did not require post-PCR steps. Thus, this technique has potential for application in prenatal diagnosis of thal and can inform prevention and control programs."

    "abstract": "Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inducers, among which hydroxyurea is the most extensively used, have shifted the paradigm toward the treatment of non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Xmn1 polymorphism (rs7482144) is characterized by substitution (C>T) at -158 position of the γ-globin gene, which leads to CC, CT, or TT genotype. Recently, the role of the Xmn1 polymorphism as a modifier of hydroxyurea therapy has attracted immense research interest. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the Xmn1 polymorphism and determine its impact on the efficacy of hydroxyurea therapy in children with NTDT in Eastern India. This observational ambispective cohort study involved the assessment of 50 patients with NTDT, of whom 28 qualified, who had been receiving hydroxyurea for less than a month. Relevant molecular analyses were performed, and data on the annual transfusion requirement (ATR), height, and HbF level before starting hydroxyurea treatment were derived from medical records. The same parameters were reassessed after 6 months of hydroxyurea therapy. Furthermore, patients were monitored for drug toxicity. All patients included in this study exhibited HbE-β-thalassemia, thus implying it to be one of the commonest NTDT genotypes in Eastern India. The prevalence rates of CC and CT were 43% and 57%, respectively, and none of the patients harbored the TT genotype. Toxicity developed in 22% of patients; however, it was not significantly associated with the Xmn1 polymorphism. Significant decrease in ATR and increase in height were observed following hydroxyurea therapy in both groups. Nevertheless, the change was more marked in CT genotype (median ATR drop: 33%, increase in median height: 3.7%, pCT=0.001) than in CC genotype (median ATR drop: 28%, increase in median height: 2.8%, pCC= 0.003). The T allele of the Xmn1 polymorphism had a favorable effect on the efficacy of hydroxyurea in patients with HbE-β-NTDT."

    "abstract": "Limited data are available on the causes of hydrops fetalis in dogs. Congenital heart defects may be an important contributing factor. Standard autopsy often fails to provide a comprehensive and accurate diagnosis on very small hearts. This study was carried out on five French bulldog puppies all presenting with advanced hydrops fetalis and four diagnosed with pulmonary hypoplasia at autopsy. The body weight of the dogs ranged from 142 to 687 g and the heart with lungs weighed from 4.5 to 23.6 g. The hearts and pulmonary vessels were filled with barium contrast, and micro-CT scans of the physiologically connected heart and lungs were performed. In all five puppies, we confirmed congenital heart defects including: Puppy #1. Perimembranous ventricular septal defect and aortic dextroposition; Puppy #2. Interrupted aortic arch with aortic valve dysplasia and aortic stenosis; Puppy #3. Tricuspid valve dysplasia and bicuspid pulmonary trunk valve; Puppy #4. Aortic stenosis and ventricular septal defect; Puppy #5. Tricuspid valve dysplasia. Additionally, four puppies had pulmonary vascular hypoplasia. Contrast-enhanced micro-CT can provide highly accurate diagnosis of complex congenital heart and lung defects. Examination of the heart in conjunction with the lungs appears to be a rational approach in animals with hydrops fetalis."

    "abstract": "Pakistan is facing a triple burden of diseases: communicable diseases (CDs), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and disabilities. There is limited evidence on the patterns of these diseases in Pakistan, specifically Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additionally there remains limited study on the impact of sex-, age and setting-stratified morbidities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The objective of this study was to present the demographic characteristics and the burden of locally-specific CDs (hepatitis B and C, TB, AIDS), NCDs (diabetes, renal diseases, asthma, epilepsy, coronary heart diseases, cancer, hypertension, cholesterol, thalassemia), and disabilities (congenital, post-disease, post-injury, paralysis) stratified by sex, age and setting in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Integrated Population and Health Survey (KP-IPHS) was conducted in 2016-17 to gather comprehensive information about the demographic characteristics and locale-specific health-related issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 24 districts across all 7 divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on population ageing ≥18 years. A total of 20704 respondents were taken from primary (n = 1061) and secondary sampling units (n = 15724), designed with considerations for urban/rural and socio-economic status. Each primary unit included 250-300 households. The sample selection utilised a multi-staged stratified systematic cluster sampling technique, involving the inclusion of every 16th household in rural areas and every 12th household in urban areas. Observations were recorded on demographics, quality of life, physical activity, BMI, disabilities, CDs and NCDs. Among all NCDs, hypertension has the highest prevalence (29.2%), showing a significant difference between females (32.7%) and males (25.0%). The proportion of males and females with diabetes is 7.4% and 5.2%, respectively, with a more substantial percentage (11.2%) observed in the ≥50 years' age group compared to 2.5% in the 18-29 years' age group and 5.0% in the 30-49 years' age group. Among the included CDs, hepatitis B and C (0.5% and 0.8%, respectively) are most prevalent. Hepatitis B is more common in females (0.8%) and in rural settings (0.6%) compared to males (0.3%) and urban settings (0.2%), respectively. The prevalence of congenital disabilities is the highest of all disabilities, with a significantly high prevalence in females (5.3%) and rural settings (3.5%) compared to males (0.9%) and urban settings (0.6%) respectively. Furthermore, post-injury, post-disease disabilities, and paralysis significantly increase with age (P < 0.001). Our findings show that the prevalence of CDs, NCDs and disabilities varies across sex, age and settings, with a notable prevalence in females and the old-age population (≥50 years). The results emphasise the necessity of public health efforts, such as screening, prevention, and treatment, to tackle the triple burden of CDs, NCDs, and disabilities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan."

    "abstract": "This study aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the clinical phenotypic characteristics of children with anemia of unknown etiology, particularly focusing on the early detection of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and exploring genetic screening strategies for this condition in childhood. The study included children with anemia whose underlying cause could not be definitively identified through routine clinical diagnosis. Clinical data was collected and genetic diagnosis of HS was confirmed using next-generation sequencing. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical characteristics of children with HS. A total of thirty children with unexplained anemia were included in the study, resulting in a gene detection diagnostic rate of 80%. This included the identification of five non-HS-related congenital anemia genes (16.66%, 5/30) and nineteen cases of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Upon initial diagnosis, the clinical features of HS were not significantly distinct compared to other forms of anemia. In Jiangxi, China, our strategy of genetic screening for these children is feasible after excluding the common causes of anemia, such as nutritional anemia, G-6-PD deficiency, thalassemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and myelopoietic abnormalities in children. This is an exploration to establish a genetic screening strategy for children with HS, and more detailed genetic screening strategies need to be further studied and explored. Next-generation sequencing remains the main method for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of HS."

This study aimed to establish a population pharmacokinetic model and simulate the dosage protocol in HCT patients with thalassemia (TM) to fill the gap of lacking MMF dosing regimen. The mycophenolic acid (MPA) plasma concentrations were obtained from HCT patients with TM after using MMF. The population pharmacokinetic (PPK) parameters were obtained by NONMEM (Version VII, Level 2.0; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA) program. Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine the optimal dosing. A total of 239 blood samples from 31 pediatric patients were available, the PPK of MPA was described as a two-compartment model. The typical values for MPA clearance (CL), central distribution volume (V<sub>2</sub>), peripheral distribution volume (V<sub>3</sub>), intercompartmental clearance (Q), and absorption rate constant (Ka) were 14.9 L/h, 83.5L, 141L, 3.13 L/h, and 1.37/h respectively. The inter-individual variability (IIV) of CL and V<sub>2</sub> were 35% and 41%, respectively. Simulation results suggested that, as the patient's body surface area (BSA) value increased, MMF dosage initiated from 500 mg twice daily was effective. A 'tiered' dosage regimen including patient urea and with doses stratified across BSA quartiles, rather than a 'one dose fits all' regimen, would help individualize MMF therapy in this population."

For lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) often represents the main therapeutic approach. In utero enzyme replacement therapy (IUERT) has several potential benefits compared to postnatal therapy, such as: (1) delivering enzyme before the onset of irreversible organ damage; (2) developing tolerance toward the recombinant enzyme; and (3) targeting the central nervous system through a more permeable blood-brain barrier. In this review, we examine the general and disease-specific rationale for IUERT, and provide an overview of the main elements of our current clinical trial for the prenatal treatment of early-onset lysosomal storage diseases.

    "abstract": "Thalassemia major is a significant public health concern, passed from parents to children, which can be mitigated through screening programs. Inconsistencies in blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy result in physical changes that can cause psychological problems, with anxiety being the most prominent. This study aimed to examine the factors influencing anxiety levels among adolescent thalassemia major survivors. The research utilized a quantitative approach with a correlational analytic design and cross-sectional method. It included a population of 122 adolescent survivors, all of whom were included using a total sampling technique. Data analysis involved univariate analysis by frequency distribution, bivariate analysis using the chi-square test, and multivariate analysis with logistic regression. The findings of the study showed that adolescent thalassemia survivors experienced varying levels of anxiety: mild anxiety in 70.5%, moderate anxiety in 9.8%, and severe anxiety in 19.7%. Significant associations were observed between anxiety levels and factors such as body image (p < 0.001), self-esteem, and coping strategies, while social support did not show a significant relationship. Body image was identified as the most impactful factor, with poor body image raising the risk of severe anxiety by 11.6 times. Anxiety is common among adolescent thalassemia survivors, with body image, self-esteem, and coping skills being key factors. Poor body image notably increases the risk of severe anxiety, emphasizing the need for psychological support focused on body image, self-esteem, and coping strategies to improve mental health in this group."

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health problem and may result in co-infection with other pathogens such as influenza virus. This review investigates the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B among patients with COVID-19. This meta- analysis included 38 primary studies investigating co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza in confirmed cases of COVID-19. The global online databases were used to identify relevant studies published between December 2019 and July 2024. Data analysis was performed using STATA Ver. 17 software, and standard errors of prevalence were calculated using the binomial distribution formula. Heterogeneity of study results was evaluated using the I-square and Q index, and publication bias was examined using the Begg's and Egger's tests, as well as funnel plot. A random effects model was used to determine prevalence rates, and a forest plot diagram was used to present results with 95% confidence intervals. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to check the impact of each primary study on the overall estimate. The analysis found that the prevalence of influenza in co-infected patients at 95% confidence interval using a random effect model was 14% (95% CI: 8-20%). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the random-effects model for influenza A, 11% (95% CI: 5-18%) and B, 4% (95% CI: 2-7%) in co-infected patients. The highest prevalence of influenza A/B (21%), influenza A (17%) and influenza B (20%) was shown in Asia and Europe respectively. Subgroup analysis by study year showed that the co-prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A/B was similar in the pre-2021 and post-2021 time periods, at 14% (95% CI: 5-23%) for pre-2021 and 6-22% for 2021 and post-2021. Also, the overall prevalence of influenza A and B in COVID-19 patients is 11% and 4%, and there was no significant difference between the time periods before and after 2021. Meta-regression with a random-effects model showed that the variables location, year group, and total patients showed only 2.71% of very high heterogeneity (I² = 99.92%), and none of these variables had a significant effect on the co-prevalence of COVID-19 and influenza A/B (p > 0.05). Also, meta-regression results showed that these variables had no significant effect on influenza A and B prevalence (p > 0.05) and showed only a small proportion of the very high heterogeneity (I² = 99.72%), (I² = 68.78%). In our study, Egger's test indicated that there was publication bias or small study effects in this meta-analysis (p = 0.0000). The combination of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza and other respiratory viruses requires the best treatment protocols to reduce the severity of the disease. In this approach, high vaccination coverage against seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 could reduce the risk of co-infection in the recent pandemic."

    "title": "Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor-Primed Bone Marrow Transplantation Experience in 350 Matched Sibling Donor Grafts for Severe Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "For matched related hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for non-malignant diseases, most centers prefer bone marrow (BM) over peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts owing to increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD-associated with the latter. BM generally entails delayed neutrophil and platelet recovery compared with PBSC transplants. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-primed bone marrow (G-BM) has been associated with faster hematologic recovery while retaining a decreased risk of GVHD. Moreover, it may allow for reduced marrow collection volumes. We retrospectively analyzed our experience with G-BM as graft source from July 2015 to February 2023 across 350 consecutive first matched sibling transplants in children with severe thalassemia in four centers in India. We observed that G-BM is associated with rapid hematologic recovery with relatively low rates of cytomegalovirus reactivation (16%), low rates of moderate to severe GVHD (grade 3-4 acute GVHD was 5% and moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 3%), and reduced marrow collection volumes (12.5 ml/kg of donor's weight), and thus is potentially safer for both donors and recipients compared with standard bone marrow. This observation was made in a relatively homogenous cohort of multiply transfused patients with thalassemia who are at high risk of rejection. None of the donors required third-party blood transfusion irrespective of donor-recipient weight discrepancy. Our experience suggests that G-BM is associated with prompt engraftment and very low rates of moderate or severe GVHD. It also appears to be safe for donors and decreases the risk for third-party red blood cell transfusions. Finally, it is relatively easy and inexpensive to collect. G-BM should be strongly considered as a preferable graft source in matched-related donor transplantations for thalassemia and potentially other transplant indications."

    "abstract": "To explore the correlation between cardiac iron deposition and left ventricular function indicators, such as left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction, and to evaluate the accuracy of predicting patients with cardiac iron deposition by using left ventricular ejection fraction as an index. This quantitative cross-sectional study involved one hundred and fifty transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia major who were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging to obtain <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>* values, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction. The relationship between cardiac <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>* values and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction was analyzed. Out of the 150 patients, cardiac iron overload was not observed for 92 patients, 42 patients exhibited mild to moderate cardiac iron overload, and 16 patients were severe cardiac iron overloaded. A linear correlation was not observed between the cardiac <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>* values and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction (<i>P</i> > 0.05). For the left ventricular ejection fraction index, the sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the agreement rate were 83.3%, 63.2%, 8.6%, 98.9%, and 64.0%, respectively; also, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.348. A linear correlation was not observed between cardiac <i>R</i><sub>2</sub>* values and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with β-thalassemia major. Therefore, using left ventricular ejection fraction as an indirect index to predict cardiac iron deposition may be not reliable in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Beta-haemoglobinopathies are severe genetic anemias caused by mutations that affect adult haemoglobin production. Many therapeutic approaches aim to reactivate the expression of the fetal hemoglobin genes. To this end, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been used to genetically modify patients' hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and reactivate fetal hemoglobin expression in their erythroid progeny. More than 70 patients with severe β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease have been treated with the Casgevy® therapy. Most have achieved a significant improvement of clinical phenotype, with high editing efficiency in hematopoietic cells associated with normal or near normal hemoglobin levels. While the long-term safety and efficacy of this powerful approach still need to be evaluated, new strategies are being developed to further improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce potential genotoxicity and lower the costs of therapy."

    "abstract": "To quantitatively assess the retinal vascular tortuosity of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and retinopathy (SCR) using an automated deep learning (DL)-based pipeline. Cross-sectional study. Patients diagnosed with SCD and screened for SCR at an academic eye center between January 2015 and November 2022 were identified using electronic health records. Eyes of unaffected matched patients (i.e., no history of SCD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or retinal occlusive disorder) served as controls. For each patient, demographic data, sickle cell diagnosis, types and total number of sickle cell crises, SCD medications used, ocular and systemic comorbidities, and history of intraocular treatment were extracted. A previously published DL algorithm was used to calculate retinal microvascular tortuosity using ultrawidefield pseudocolor fundus imaging among patients with SCD vs. controls. Cumulative tortuosity index (CTI). Overall, 64 patients (119 eyes) with SCD and 57 age- and race-matched controls (106 eyes) were included. The majority of the patients with SCD were females (65.6%) and of Black or African descent (78.1%), with an average age of 35.1 ± 20.1 years. The mean number of crises per patient was 3.4 ± 5.2, and the patients took 0.7 ± 0.9 medications. The mean CTI for eyes with SCD was higher than controls (1.06 ± vs. 1.03 ± 0.02, <i>P</i> < 0.001). On subgroup analysis, hemoglobin S, hemoglobin C, and HbS/beta-thalassemia variants had significantly higher CTIs compared with controls (1.07 vs. 1.03, <i>P</i> < 0.001), but not with sickle cell trait variant (1.04 vs. 1.03 control, <i>P</i> = .2). Univariable analysis showed a higher CTI in patients diagnosed with proliferative SCR, most significantly among those with sea-fan neovascularization (1.06 ± 0.02 vs. 1.04 ± 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and those with >3 sickle cell crises (1.07 ± 0.02 vs. 1.05 ± 0.02, <i>P</i> < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Beta thalassemia major (β-TM) is a severe genetic anemia with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. This study investigated whether genotype correlates with distinct myocardial iron overload patterns, assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T2* values. CMR data for cardiac iron deposition evaluation, which recruited pediatric participants between January 2021 and December 2024, were analyzed with CVI42. The patients were classified into three genetic subgroups of β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup>, β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>+</sup>, and β<sup>+</sup>/β<sup>+</sup> based on their genetic outcomes. The CMR results classified patients into normal myocardial T2* value and myocardial iron overload groups. Qualitative and quantitative factors were subsequently compared by groups using comparative statistics. The study included 145 pediatric β-TM patients, with 24 (17%) exhibiting cardiac iron deposition based on CMR T2* values. There were significant differences in iron chelation treatment strategies across genotypes, with the β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> genotype accounting for 54% (13/24) of patients in the cardiac iron deposition group. Regardless of genotype, the mid-inferolateral segment consistently showed the lowest CMR T2* values and the highest prevalence of iron deposition. The risk of cardiac iron deposition increases as age progresses, and the mid-inferolateral segment is more susceptible to iron accumulation. The β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> genotype is more likely to suffer from cardiac iron overload, emphasizing the need for closer clinical monitoring and regular cardiac MRI evaluations."

    "title": "Therapeutic gene correction of HBB frameshift CD41-42 (-TCTT) deletion in human hematopoietic stem cells.",
    "abstract": "Β-thalassemia is one of the global health burdens. The CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation at HBB is the most prevalent pathogenic mutation of β-thalassemia in both China and Southeast Asia. Previous studies focused on repairing the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation in β-thalassemia patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells, which were subsequently differentiated into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation. In this study, we directly applied the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy to correct the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation in patient-derived HSPCs. The effective editing induced by Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) was confirmed in HUDEP-2 cell lines harboring the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation. Further correction of heterozygote and homozygote HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutations in patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a 13.4-40.8% increase in the proportion of HBB-expressing (HBB +) cells following erythroid differentiation in vitro. At 16 weeks post-xenotransplantation of the edited HSPCs into coisogenic immunodeficient mice, the reparation efficiency in engrafted bone marrow was 17.21% ± 3.66%. Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of the engrafted bone marrow showed an increase in the percentage of HBB + cells without impairing the ability of engraftment, self-renewal, and multilineage hematopoietic repopulation of HSPCs. For the safety evaluation, 103 potential off-target sites were predicted by SITE-seq and CRISPOR, with one site displaying significant off-target editing. Since this off-target site is located in the intergenic region, it is presumed to pose minimal risk. Taken together, our study provides critical preclinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of the gene therapy approach for HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation."

Studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of HU on β-thalassemia patients were searched in Pub-Med, Cochrane Databases, Web of Science, China-Biology-Medicine, CNKI, Embase, VIP, and WanFang data. The proportions of response rate (RR) (50% fall in transfusion need in transfusion-dependent <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients, or 1 g/dL elevate in hemoglobin (Hb) levels in transfusion-independent <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients) and good RR (transfusion-free in transfusion-dependent <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients or 2 g/dL elevate in Hb levels in transfusion-independent β-thalassemia patients) were utilized to evaluate the effect size (ES). The secondary outcomes were the adverse events incidence rates of HU in <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 25 single-armed observational studies with typically 1,748 individuals were involved in our analysis. All 27 clinical trials were reported with fair quality. HU, in transfusion-dependent <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients, was related to a significant decrease in transfusion requirements [a pooled RR of 0.37 and a pooled good RR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.53-0.76)]; in transfusion-independent <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients, it was correlated to an excellent raise in Hb levels [a pooled RR of 0.20 (95% CI, 0.08-0.35) and a pooled good RR of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.41-0.65)]. Neutropenia and leucopenia were the most prevalent adverse events in <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients treated with HU, while the incidence rates of other side effects were relatively lower. Our findings demonstrated that <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients tolerated and responded well to HU. Due to the control arms absence in the involved studies, more double-masked RCTs are essential for proving the safety and efficacy of HU in <i>β</i>-thalassemia patients."

    "title": "A novel compound heterozygous mutation in the DYNC2H1 gene in a Chinese family with Jeune syndrome.",
    "abstract": "The dynein cytoplasmic two heavy chain 1 (DYNC2H1) gene encodes a cytoplasmic dynein subunit. Cytoplasmic dyneins transport cargo towards the minus end of microtubules and are thus termed the \"retrograde\" cellular motor. Mutations in DYNC2H1 are the main causative mutations of short rib-thoracic dysplasia syndrome type III with or without polydactyly (SRTD3). Early diagnosis of SRTD3 prenatally by ultrasound alone is difficult. In this case, a couple who gave birth to three consecutive babies with SRTD3 requested fertility guidance to avoid having another baby with SRTD3. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses of amniotic fluid via whole-genome sequencing (WGS), routine G-banded karyotype analysis, fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) were performed at 19 weeks. Peripheral blood samples from the parents were also screened by Sanger sequencing for SRTD3-related mutations. Two compound heterozygous mutations, c.10,594 C > T and c.7720G > A, in the DYNC2H1 gene were identified, which were inherited from the mother and father, respectively. The foetus's mother is heterozygous for the c.10,594 C > T variant, and the foetus's father is heterozygous for the c.7720G > A variant. The mutation c.10,594 C > T, which is a nonsense mutation believed to be pathogenic, has been previously reported. The mutation c.7720G > A, which is a missense mutation, has yet to be reported. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were detected in the foetus. The patient did not become pregnant after PGT-M and IVF-ET. This family subsequently accepted donated eggs; a successful pregnancy occurred, and a healthy girl was born. The compound heterogeneous mutations in DYNC2H1 ultimately accounts for the diversity of disease phenotypes reported in this study and can be used to guide future pregnancies. Our findings expand the mutation spectrum of DYNC2H1 in this rare disease and highlight the value of WES in the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia with unclear prenatal indications."

    "abstract": "Myanmar is one of the countries in Southeast Asia where serious dengue outbreaks occur and Yangon is among the regions with the highest number of cases in the country. Many infections including dengue are common in Yangon during the rainy season, and co-infections may also occur. Adults are more likely than children to experience co-infections of dengue and other diseases. Although pediatric dengue has been studied in Yangon for decades, research on adult dengue is scant. Therefore, this study compared the clinical and virological characteristics of pediatric and adult dengue cases in Yangon. This cross-sectional study was conducted at Insein General Hospital in Yangon, Myanmar, from June to September 2022. We recruited 221 suspected dengue patients (134 children and 87 adults), with or without other diseases, and tested their dengue serological markers using a serological method and their dengue virus (DENV) serotypes using conventional RT-PCR. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were conducted to assess significance. The dengue non-structural protein-1 antigen (NS1Ag) positivity was 37% in children and 32% in adults. DENV serotypes were identified in 80% of NS1Ag-positive patients. Among NS1Ag-positive cases, the DENV-1 serotype predominated (67%), followed by DENV-2 (17%), DENV-3 (9%), DENV-4 (5%), and mixed DENV-1 and DENV-2 (2%) serotypes. Shock was observed in 14% of children and 3% of adults. Anti-dengue IgG antibody positivity was positively correlated with dengue shock. Three pediatric dengue cases (6%) also had other infections including bronchiolitis, ear infection, and diarrhea. Seven adult dengue cases (25%) also had other diseases including advanced HIV infection, severe pneumonia, tonsillitis, thyroid disease, cholecystitis, drug poisoning, and thalassemia. The serotype distribution and clinical presentations of pediatric and adult dengue cases were not significantly different, but adults were more likely to have dengue together with other diseases than children. This study provides information for the better management of febrile children and adults in hospital settings and provides a foundation for nationwide epidemiological studies on dengue serotypes and modifications of the national guidelines for dengue management in Myanmar."

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) presents a significant global health concern, affecting 3.3% of the world's population. The primary mode of HCV transmission is through blood and blood products. Patients with beta thalassemia, who rely on lifelong blood transfusions, are particularly vulnerable to HCV infections. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infections among multitransfused thalassemic patients in the twin cities of Pakistan's capital. The clinical research, involving the enrollment of 262 multitransfused beta thalassemic patients residing in the capital twin cities of Pakistan. The investigation encompassed the evaluation of hepatitis C virus presence, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, serum creatinine, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and the occurrence of splenectomy. The overall prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infections was notably high at 55.73%. This was particularly pronounced among patients aged 20 years and older, with a 100% infection rate. In HCV-positive thalassemic patients, the average ALT level was observed to be 98 U/L, while average creatinine values stood at 0.39 mg/dL. Additionally, hepatomegaly was prevalent in 82.20% of HCV-positive thalassemic patients, featuring an average liver size increase of 4.33 cm. Splenomegaly was evident in 67.12% of HCV-positive thalassemic patients, with an average spleen size augmentation of 4.46 cm. Splenectomy was identified in 15.75% of cases. The incidence of HCV infections in the thalassemic population of Pakistan is alarmingly high. Furthermore, the risk of contracting HCV infections escalates with the advancing age of thalassemic patients. Elevated ALT levels and hepatomegaly were pervasive among the majority of HCV-positive thalassemic patients. Consequently, there is a compelling need for rigorous screening of blood products prior to transfusion to mitigate the future burden of HCV in Pakistan."

Hb Hekinan was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Additional genetic determinants, including α-thalassemia, β-thalassemia and other variants, were detected using multiplex GAP-PCR, ARMS-PCR or direct DNA sequencing as appropriate. Among 61,997 Hb typing samples, 149 cases of Hb Hekinan were identified in Thai individuals and classified into 8 genotypic groups. These included 104 Hb Hekinan heterozygotes, 10 Hb Hekinan coexisting with α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia, 3 Hb Hekinan with non-deletional α-variants, 6 Hb Hekinan with α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia, 21 double heterozygote for Hb Hekinan and HbE, 3 Hb Hekinan with β-thalassemia trait, 1 triple heterozygotes (Hb Hekinan/α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/Hb E) and 1 quadruple heterozygote for Hb Hekinan/α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia/Hb E/Hb Hope.

Complete blood count and hemoglobin (Hb) analysis using capillary electrophoresis were performed. Genotypes were defined by DNA analysis. Among 371 fetuses, 36 were non-thalassemic and 29 thalassemia genotypes were identified in the remaining 335 fetuses. Fetuses with β-thalassemia and Hb E traits, homozygous Hb E, and Hb E-β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia had similar hematological parameters as those of non-thalassemic. However, the levels of Hb A in β-thalassemia and Hb E traits were approximately half of that observed in the non-thalassemic fetuses. As for Hb E, fetuses with a single copy of the β<sup>E</sup>-globin gene in the Hb E trait and Hb E-β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia had lower Hb E levels as compared to that of the homozygous Hb E. For α-thalassemia, fetuses with one or two α-globin gene defects had small changes in hematological parameters, but variable Hb Bart's levels were observed. Fetuses with Hb H and Hb H-CS diseases had moderate anemia, whereas those with homozygous Hb CS and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis had severe anemia. Identification of the fetuses with Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis with various genetic interactions allows the exact re-location of electrophoretic mobilities of various embryonic Hbs. This study confirmed the genetic heterogeneity of hemoglobinopathies among the fetuses and fetal blood analysis are useful for presumptive diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies.

    "abstract": "Osteopetrosis is a group of genetically and clinically diverse inherited disorders characterized by an increase in bone density. The main known cause is an abnormality in the development or function of osteoclasts. Hence, the process of bone resorption is impaired, resulting in: 1- a reduction in bone marrow volume and, subsequently, a decrement in the hematopoietic capacity of bone marrow, which leads to anemia and compromised immunological function; 2- improper bone development, which leads to pressure on peripheral nerves, causing auditory, visual, and movement impairments; and 3- disturbance in the formation of bone microstructure that leads to susceptibility to bone fracture. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical symptoms and genetic causes of 30 patients (probands) who suffered from malignant infantile osteopetrosis, a subtype of this disorder. The Sanger sequencing technique was used to sequence four common genes (TCIRG1, CLCN7, SNX10, and OSTM1) in osteopetrosis. Subsequently, the selected variants were subjected to segregation analysis between the probands and their parents. Consequently, the sequencing of these four genes in probands revealed 16 pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations, five of which had never been reported before. The TCIRG1 gene has three novel splice site variations and one frameshift variant. The CLCN7 gene had a novel missense variant. Also, a total of five variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) were identified in the analyzed sequences, of which three haven't been reported to date, and two were observed in osteopetrosis patients. Therefore, by documenting these novel likely pathogenic variants and VUS in known genes associated with this disease in patients, specialists can conduct more accurate genetic analysis and counseling when encountering these variants. Additionally, this documentation will facilitate the reclassification of these variants."

This journey, initiated by foundational techniques such as ZFNs and TALENs and culminating in the groundbreaking work of Doudna and Charpentier in 2012, has ushered in an era of precise DNA alteration and profound insights into gene functions. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses the Cas9 enzyme and guides RNA (gRNA) to precisely target and cleave DNA, with subsequent repair via error-prone NHEJ or precise HDR, enabling versatile gene editing. Complementary computational tools like E-CRISP and Azimuth 2.0, alongside advanced deep learning models like DeepCRISPR, have significantly contributed to refining CRISPR experiments, optimizing gRNA efficiency, and predicting outcomes with greater precision. In clinical applications, CRISPR-Cas9 shows great promise for treating complex genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, but faces challenges such as off-target effects, immune responses to viral vectors, and ethical issues in germline editing. Overcoming these challenges requires meticulous experimentation and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial utilization of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology across diverse fields, including cancer treatment, genetic disease therapies, agriculture, and synthetic biology, while continually addressing ethical, safety, and legal considerations for its advancement and widespread adoption."

    "title": "Metformin and Cognitive Performance in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: An Umbrella Review.",
    "abstract": "Contradictory results for the association between metformin intake and changes in cognitive function have been reported. We attempted to overview systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing the role of metformin, as mono or combination therapy, in cognitive performance alterations among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to determine the quality of the evidence as well. To find the English-written reviews, a literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Trip, and Google Scholar by May 1, 2023. The literature search unearthed 2672 records, 10 of which were included in the study. Metformin may provide cognitive benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes, as evidence suggests potential improvements in memory and a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Even though the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) score alterations correspond to raising concerns about cognitive decline, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and selective reminding test (SRT) score improvements support metformin's role in improving specific cognitive domains. As such, metformin may exert differential impacts on various aspects of cognitive performance in these patients. However, the inconsistency and low quality of current evidence point toward the need for accurate research to elucidate whether metformin's cognitive effects are protective, neutral, or context-dependent based on patient profiles."

Abnormalities in RBC shapes (Poikilocytosis) and sizes (Anisocytosis) can impede oxygen-carrying capacity, leading to conditions such as anemia, thalassemia, McLeod Syndrome, liver disease, and so on. Hematologists typically spend considerable time manually examining RBC's shapes and sizes using a microscope and it is time-consuming. The proposed LSTM based neural network (NN) deep-learning strategy helps to classify abnormal RBCs automatically and accurately and overcome blood-related disorders at an early stage. After data processing, traditional and high-level features are fused to clearly distinguish between abnormal RBC classes. Class imbalance favors the dominant class, resulting in biased forecasts. To address class imbalance, a custom loss function is generated by integrating class weights and loss functions before feeding fused features to the NN classifier. Specifically, the loss function is designed to assign higher penalties to the misclassification of underrepresented classes, ensuring that the model is more sensitive to these classes during training. This is achieved by integrating class weights directly into the cross-entropy loss calculation, thereby balancing the influence of each class on the model's learning process. The proposed approach's performance is evaluated using the publicly accessible Chula-PIC-Lab dataset and privately gathered dataset from the Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (CCHRC) in Assam, India.

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 190 parents having BTM children registered in thalassemia care centers throughout the Makran division from May 2023 to October 2023. The structured questionnaire was used and data was collected using the non-probability convenience technique. SPSS 20 was used for analysis. A total of 190 parents were interviewed and only 111 (58.42%) couples were practicing family planning. A significant relation was found between Family planning and monthly income, religious belief, parents with more than three children, and different districts of the Makran division. (p<0.05) The most common methods of contraception used by participating couples were oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (18.4%) followed by barriers (16.8%). The predominant reason for not practicing family planning was the desire to have more children and religious beliefs. The religious beliefs, economic status of the family, area of residence, and total number of children play a significant role in family planning practices among the parents of children affected with BTM."

    "abstract": "α thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) serves as a part of the sucrose nonfermenting 2 (SNF2) chromatin-remodeling complex. In interphase, ATRX localizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin, contributing to DNA double-strand break repair, DNA replication, and telomere maintenance. During mitosis, most ATRX proteins are removed from chromosomal arms, leaving a pool near the centromere region in mammalian cells, which is critical for accurate chromosome congression and sister chromatid cohesion protection. However, the function and localization mechanisms of ATRX at mitotic centromeres remain largely unresolved. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system and overexpression approaches were employed alongside immunofluorescence to investigate the mechanism of ATRX localization at the centromere. To study the binding mechanism between ATRX and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), both full-length and truncated mutants of hemagglutinin (HA)-ATRX were generated for co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull assays. Wild-type ATRX and HP1 binding-deficient mutants were created to investigate the role of ATRX binding to HP1 during mitosis, with the Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132) maintenance assay, cohesion function assay, and kinetochore distance measurement. Our research demonstrated that HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ facilitate the positioning of ATRX within the mitotic centromere area through their interaction with the first two [P/L]-X-V-X-[M/L/V] (PxVxL)motifs at the N-terminus of ATRX. ATRX deficiency causes aberrant mitosis and decreased centromeric cohesion. Furthermore, reducing Wapl activity can bypass the need for ATRX to protect centromeric cohesion. These results provide insights into the mechanism of ATRX's centromeric localization and its critical function in preserving centromeric cohesion by reducing Wapl activity in human cells."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin is an oxygen-transport protein in red blood cells that interacts with multiple ligands, e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide. Genetic variations in hemoglobin chains, such as those underlying sickle cell disease and thalassemias, present substantial clinical challenges. Here, we review the progress in research, including the use of allosteric modulators, pharmacological chaperones, and antioxidant treatments, which has begun to improve hemoglobin stability and oxygen affinity. According to UniProt (as of 7 August 2024), 819 variants of the α-hemoglobin subunit and 771 variants of the β-hemoglobin subunit have been documented, with over 116 classified as unstable. These data demonstrate the urgent need to develop variant-specific stabilizing options. Beyond small-molecule drugs/binders, novel protein-based strategies-such as engineered hemoglobin-binding proteins (including falcilysin, llama-derived nanobodies, and α-hemoglobin-stabilizing proteins)-offer promising new options. As our understanding of hemoglobin's structural and functional diversity grows, so does the potential for genotype-driven approaches. Continued research into hemoglobin stabilization and ligand-binding modification may yield more precise, effective treatments and pave the way toward effective strategies for hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been widely adopted for the screening of chromosomal abnormalities; however, its adoption for monogenic disorders, such as β-thalassaemia, has proven challenging. Haemoglobinopathies are the most common monogenic disorders globally, with β-thalassaemia being particularly prevalent in Cyprus. This study introduces a non-invasive prenatal haplotyping (NIPH) assay for β-thalassaemia, utilizing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma. The assay determines paternal inheritance by analyzing highly heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the β-globin gene cluster. To identify highly heterozygous SNVs in the population, 96 randomly selected samples were processed using Illumina DNA-prep NGS chemistry. A custom, high-density NGS genotyping panel, named HAPLONID, was designed with 169 SNVs, including 15 common pathogenic ones. The AmpliSeq for Illumina assay was then applied to cfDNA to evaluate the panel's efficiency in performing NIPT for β-thalassaemia. Analysis revealed 219 highly polymorphic SNVs, and the sequencing of 17 families confirmed successful paternal allele determination. The NIPH assay demonstrated 100% success in diagnostic interpretation. This study achieved the advancement of an integrated NGS-NIPT assay for β-thalassaemia, bringing it one step closer to being a diagnostic assay and thereby enabling a reduction in the number of risky invasive prenatal sampling procedures in Cyprus and elsewhere."

Ischemic lesions were categorized as lacunar, small vessel, or multifocal. Variables including age, years of education, presence and type of MRI-detected ischemia, smoking status, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, ferritin levels, vitamin B12 levels, fasting blood sugar, splenectomy status, chelation therapy, and hydroxyurea treatment were compared between the two groups. <i>Results:</i> The mean age was 27.33 years in the thalassemia major group and 32.65 years in the sickle cell anemia group (<i>p</i> = 0.010). No statistically significant difference was observed in the distribution of ischemia types between the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.303). The thalassemia major group had a lower mean hemoglobin level (8.37 g/dL) compared to the sickle cell anemia group (9.57 g/dL) (<i>p</i> = 0.003). Ferritin levels were significantly higher in the thalassemia major group (2018.92 ng/mL) than in the sickle cell anemia group (660.39 ng/mL) (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <i>Conclusions:</i> Although ischemic lesions were more frequently observed in patients with sickle cell anemia, the difference was not statistically significant. These findings emphasize the importance of ongoing surveillance and individualized management to mitigate cerebrovascular risks in both patient populations."

Individuals who visited MMH between September 2021 and December 2022 and were known or suspected to have SCD were enrolled in the clinic. Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features were documented, and laboratory tests were performed. A two-sample test of proportions was used to ascertain the significance of differences in the distribution of clinical outcomes between the follow-up visits. A total of 724 patients with SCD were enrolled: 367 (50.7%) were male, and 357 (49.3%) were female. Most patients-713 (98.5%) in total-were homozygous (Hb SS), 9 (1.2%) had the Hb SC phenotype, and 2 (0.3%) had HbS β+ thalassemia. The majority of patients were aged 13 years and below-520 (71.8%) in total-and most did not have health insurance-582 (80.4%) in total. While all patients received folic acid, only a quarter received pneumococcal prophylaxis and hydroxyurea. Attendance at the third visit was associated with a reduced frequency of self-reported episodes of pain (24 patients [4.3%] vs. 11 patients [1.9%]). The population of patients with SCD in Zanzibar mostly comprised children who were Hb SS. Basic care services are still suboptimal, although they are associated with better outcomes when present. Thorough evaluation of SCD prevalence in Zanzibar through newborn screening programs is warranted."

    "abstract": "Thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide and have a significant impact on public health. The decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has quickly enabled the development of new assays that allow for the simultaneous analysis of small nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) as deletions/duplications of α- and β-globin genes. This study highlighted the efficacy and rapid identification of all types of mutations in the α- and β-globin genes, including silent variants, using the Devyser Thalassemia NGS kit. Furthermore, we report the frequency of mutations identified in a total population of 2649 individuals recruited from four Italian Medical Genetics Laboratories. All samples were first hematologically characterized, and sequence analysis was conducted by using the Devyser Thalassemia NGS kit. All variants were also validated in an independent sample by a conventional molecular test. A total of 1789 subjects were identified with genetic variants in the globin genes, of which 966 (53.9%) had variations in the β-gene, 480 (26.8%) had variations in the α-gene; and 307 (17.1%) had variations in both α- and β-genes. Variant analysis evidenced a heterogeneous mutation spectrum enriched with variants not usually observed in the Italian population. This study showed the high effectiveness and the rapid identification of all mutation types in both α- and β-globin genes, including silent variants. It should be emphasized that the NGS approach greatly shortens turnaround reporting times, overcoming the classic diagnostic flowchart which envisages multistep, subsequent, diagnostic approaches, often requiring long resolution times."

    "abstract": "We present a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a variant hemoglobin whose HbA1c levels were falsely elevated regardless of the measurement method [high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzymatic, and immuno-assay] used. The causes of the falsely high HbA1c levels in this patient were investigated. The patient was a 73-year-old man with frequent hypoglycemia on self-monitoring of blood glucose, whose HbA1c level when measured by HPLC (standard mode) and immunoassay was substantially higher than that predicted by continuous blood glucose monitoring or from the patient's glycated albumin level. In addition, the HbA1c level measured by immunoassay was significantly higher than the level measured by the HPLC and enzymatic HbA1c assays. A globin gene analysis showed that this patient had Hb Hirose (β-37Trp→Ser) as well as a β-198A→G mutation in the promoter region of the gene. To clarify the causes of this apparently falsely elevated HbA1c level, measurements of <i>in vitro</i> glycation potential and erythrocyte creatine, a marker of red blood cell lifespan, were performed. Although <i>in vitro</i> glycation potential was within normal limits, the red blood cell lifespan was estimated to be 72.7 days (reference range: 55.1-66.7 days). These results suggested that an increased red blood cell lifespan contributed to the high HbA1c levels measured by the various methods used. Increased hemoglobin antigenicity due to the gene mutations in this patient may have contributed to the high HbA1c levels measured by immunoassay."

    "abstract": "Blood donation plays a critical role in healthcare systems by supplying blood and blood products for surgeries, emergency care, and chronic disease management. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of genetic disorders, like sickle cell disease and thalassemia, further increase the need for a stable blood supply. However, high rates of donor deferrals remain a significant barrier to maintaining a reliable blood supply. This study aims to analyse the main factors contributing to blood donor deferrals at King Fahad Hospital Al Hofuf between January 2023 and August 2024. By identifying and correlating key deferral reasons with donor demographics, the study seeks to provide actionable insights to reduce deferral rates and enhance donor retention. This retrospective observational study analysed blood donation records of 21,149 donors, including both eligible and deferred individuals. Demographic data (age, gender, nationality) and medical assessments (hemoglobin levels, blood pressure) were collected and analysed to identify deferral trends. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to assess the relationships between donor characteristics and deferral reasons, with chi-square tests and logistic regression used to identify predictors of deferral. Data analyses showed that 89.5% of deferred donors were male, with the largest group of deferrals aged 21-30 years. Low hemoglobin was the most common deferral reason, affecting 27.5% of all deferred donors, with female donors disproportionately affected by anemia-related deferrals. Male donors were more frequently deferred for aspirin use (13.2%) and blood pressure issues (15.9%). Seasonal trends showed deferral peaks in January and November, while the highest donation rates were recorded in April and October. Addressing the higher rates of deferral due to low hemoglobin and cardiovascular issues through targeted public health interventions could significantly improve donor retention and ensure a more reliable blood supply. Implementing iron supplementation programs for female donors and cardiovascular health screenings for male donors could reduce deferral rates."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder and traditionally considered more prevalent in Southern China. However, with increased migration and intermarriage, more and more thalassemia carriers had been reported in Northern China. The lack of screening for thalassemia carriers may also result in missed diagnosis in Northern China. Additionally, thalassemia carriers are usually asymptomatic or mild anemia, but their anemia can get worse during pregnancy. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is also one of the causes of anemia during pregnancy. In particular, both IDA and thalassemia are characterized by microcytic hypochromic anemia. The overlap of symptoms and the presence of thalassemia carriers with IDA may lead to misdiagnosis. In this study, long-read sequencing based approach termed comprehensive analysis of thalassemia alleles (CATSA) had been performed for 244 pregnant women in Northern China whose results of routine blood examinations were abnormal. As a result, 16.39 % (40/244) of the anemic pregnant women carried at least one mutation of thalassemia. One Hb H patient and a rare α-globin gene triplication combined with β-thalassemia were also identified. Of the 44 thalassemia variants detected, the -α<sup>3.7</sup>, -<sup>SEA</sup> and HBB:c.316-197C > T were the most common variants. CATSA is of great significance for determining exact genotype of 22.50 % (9/40) thalassemia carriers because 8 variants they carried were outside the detection range of routine genetic tests. It is noted that 2 novel deletions of HBA gene were identified, expanding the genotype spectrum of α-thalassemia. Our findings demonstrate the importance of thalassemia screening in Northern China. Future research should focus on expanding screening to include more diverse populations."

However, mesenchymal dysplasia can be distinguished from other conditions by the presence of villous edema and the absence of trophoblastic proliferation in the placental tissue. This pathology has been demonstrated to be associated with fetal growth restriction, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, some chromosomal abnormalities and intrauterine fetal demise. A review of the literature revealed approximately 200 articles on PMD. Nevertheless, eight articles on PMD in twin pregnancies were identified, encompassing a total of nine cases. This is the tenth case of PMD in a twin pregnancy and the fourth case of monochorionic twins in the literature. The patient was a 28-year-old primigravid woman. A portion of the placenta exhibited sonographic features consistent with PMD. Both fetuses developed hydrops fetalis at 16 weeks of gestation. The fetal karyotype demonstrated no abnormalities, and no additional major congenital anomalies were identified. Following pregnancy termination, a pathological examination confirmed PMD in the placental portion of one of the fetuses. This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on this condition, which can be challenging to diagnose and manage, particularly in twin pregnancies."

CD84, a homophilic adhesion molecule expressed on MDSCs, plays a critical role in their accumulation and function within the TME. This study aims to investigate the protein-protein interactions of CD84 using molecular dynamics simulations and to explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting these interactions. Through computational techniques, we generated highly potent mutated CD84 mini-proteins and peptides as antagonists with significantly higher affinity for CD84 to mimic the key features of the IgV-like domain of the protein. Additionally, we engineered an antibody capable of blocking CD84. Binding affinities were assessed using dissociation constant (Kd) calculations. Data analysis shows that the Kd values for the designed peptides ranged from 10 to 100 times stronger than those of the natural CD84 interactions, indicating efficient inhibition of CD84 interactions. Additionally, mutagenesis of the Ig-like V domain of CD84 resulted in variants with improved binding stability, with a Gibbs free energy change (ΔΔG) indicating enhanced interaction potential. This study provides insights into CD84 interactions and their implications for immunotherapy targeting MDSCs in solid tumors. However, experimental validation is necessary to confirm the findings of this study and evaluate peptide selectivity as potential molecular therapeutics."

We aimed to understand the medical, psychological, and sociocultural dimensions of this complex process within the Turkish healthcare context. A qualitative study was undertaken using a descriptive phenomenological approach. In-depth interviews were conducted with parents from 16 families who had successfully completed PGD+HLA matching and subsequent stem cell transplantation processes from the savior sibling to the child with thalassemia. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven-step method and MAXQDA 20.0 software. The analysis revealed six main themes: disease stage, treatment, recovery process, social/family, support systems, and recommendations. Parents reported significant emotional challenges but demonstrated unexpected resilience. Religious and cultural factors played nuanced roles, with most parents viewing the process as compatible with their beliefs. Economic burdens, prolonged hospitalizations, and geographical access to treatment centers emerged as key challenges. Extended family support and professional healthcare guidance were identified as crucial support mechanisms. This study highlights the complex interplay between advanced medical technologies and traditional values in Turkish society. The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive and culturally sensitive support systems and long-term follow-up for families. The results suggest the value of implementing multidisciplinary care teams and developing specialized support programs for families undergoing savior sibling procedures."

Present study reports spectrum of hemoglobinopathies among the referred anemia patients to single centre in central India. All individuals referred to the institute from 1st January 2012 to 31st August 2020 for diagnosis were included in the study. Demographic details, clinical and transfusion history were obtained. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (Variant II, Bio-Rad) was performed to identify the type of hemoglobinopathy. Molecular characterization of unknown or rare variants was performed wherever necessary. During the study period 13,587 individuals were screened. Homozygous beta thalassemia was observed in 0.6% of the patients, whereas SCD was observed in 12% of the patients. Seventy-four individuals have either hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) or delta beta thalassemia. More than 50% of SCD patients referred were over the age of 12 years. SCD disease was more common among Pradhan, Gond and Baiga tribes whereas HPFH and delta beta thalassemia was found among Other socially and educationally backward classes. High occurrence of hemoglobinopathies in central India warrants the need of large scale screening in highly prevalent communities for its prevention."

    "abstract": "This study analyzes survey data across 21 countries to explore correlations between delays in blood testing and the prevalence of seven health conditions: thalassaemias, sickle cell disorders, malaria, HIV, high fasting plasma glucose, impaired kidney function, and high LDL cholesterol. We analyzed Pandemic Recovery Survey data via multivariable logistic regression to compare blood test delays between individuals with and without medical conditions, while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. We also examined the disease burden using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and summary exposure values (SEV) rates. Our findings indicate profound disparities, with over 60% of respondents in Egypt, Nigeria, and India reporting they have never undergone blood tests. Individuals with existing medical conditions are significantly more likely to experience delays in blood work. There is a pronounced gap in blood work accessibility, particularly in countries with high disease burdens. Findings suggest an urgent need for interventions to improve routine blood test access for high-risk populations to reduce the underdiagnosis of significant medical conditions. Prioritizing timely and accessible blood testing can serve as a step towards mitigating healthcare disparities."

DNA analysis revealed the patient was a Hb Pontoise carrier (<i>HBA1</i>: c.191C > A). Hb Pontoise resulted from an GCC > GAC substitution at codon 63 of the <i>HBA1</i> genes, but carriers were usually asymptomatic or with only borderline hematological abnormalities. Due to mild instability of Hb Pontoise, its diagnosis relied on genetic diagnosis. Considering the high frequency of thalassemia in South China, accurate genotyping and appropriate genetic counseling should be performed for unstable hemoglobin carriers."

    "abstract": "Current guidelines for screening glucose dysregulation (GD) in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) recommend an annual 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) starting at the age of 10 years. Assessment of adherence to OGTT screening in patients with TDT. A questionnaire was distributed to 18 Thalassemia Centers in 10 different countries, targeting factors influencing adherence to annual OGTT screening in specialized multidisciplinary pediatric and adult TDT units and identifying strategies to improve adherence to OGTT in TDT patients. The mean reported percentage of all types of GD across 16 of the 18 centers at the last OGTT assessment was 32.0%, while the mean percentage for thalassemia-related diabetes mellitus (Th-RDM) was 12.2 ± 9.7% (range: 0%-41%; median: 13.2 %) in all participating centers. Notably, a high percentage of suboptimal or poor adherence to annual OGTT screening (mean 41.3%; range 10-90%) was reported by 17/18 centers. Poor adherence to annual OGTT among eligible patients was multifactorial and related to both patients and the healthcare system barriers. The most commonly suggested actions by hematologists and endocrinologists for improving the adherence to OGTT were flexibility in timing, easy approach to test location, improved collaboration among team members, and persistent reminding. Young adult patients with TDT are at high risk for developing GD and Th-RDM. Thus, annual screening with a 2-hour OGTT is recommended. Nevertheless, several patient barriers are associated with low adherence to annual OGTT. It is desirable to develop intensive initiatives to improve the screening rate for GD, while studies are warranted to update the current guidelines in TDT patients with low-risk factors for GD and for countries with low-resource settings."

Various risk factors including genetic disorders and single nucleotide polymorphisms play a role in the pathogenesis of hematologic malignancies. BMI1 is one of the genes involved in regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. 69 leukemia patients (45 AML, 18 ALL, and 6 CML) along with 80 control samples were selected. The frequency of rs1042059 and rs11591377 polymorphisms of BMI1 gene was evaluated using the Tetra-ARMS PCR technique. A significant difference in the prevalence of rs1042059 and rs11591377 polymorphisms was observed between the patient and control groups (P = < 0.001). The frequency of GA genotypes for both polymorphisms was higher in patients compared to the control group. Additionally, a significant difference was found in the prevalence of rs11591377 genotypes among the AML, ALL, and CML groups (P = 0.002) however, no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of rs1042059 genotypes among them (P = 0.578). Considering the significant decrease in the prevalence of allelic variants in the control group compared to the leukemia group, the association of BMI1 with leukemias should be considered as a diagnostic and prognostic factor."

This is a retrospective study utilizing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Nationwide Inpatient Sample. A cohort of all deliveries between 2011 and 2014 was created using ICD-9 codes. The patients with beta-thalassemia major were identified and matched to patients without beta-thalassemia based on age, race, income quartile, and type of health insurance at a ratio of 1:20. The baseline characteristics were compared between the groups using Chi-square and Fischer's exact tests, as appropriate. The univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio, respectively. Out of 3,070,656 pregnancies over the study period, beta-thalassemia major complicated 445 pregnancies. The patients with beta-thalassemia were more likely to have thyroid disorders and previous C-section (p-value < 0.05). There were no differences in pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and placenta previa. C-section was 30% more likely to be the method of birth (aOR 1.30, 95%CI 1.03-1.63) and there was more than three-fold increase in rate of blood transfusion (aOR 4.69, 95% CI 3.02-7.28) among participants with beta-thalassemia major. Mothers with beta-thalassemia, almost, were 70% more likely to have a neonate small for gestational age (aOR 1.68, 95%CI 1.07-2.62). Women with beta-thalassemia major are more likely to give birth by C-section, require blood transfusion and have small for gestational age neonates. Counseling patients with beta-thalassemia about these risks and increased antenatal surveillance is advised."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is one of the most common congenital hemoglobinopathies globally. Regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is of paramount importance in the treatment of thalassemia patients. However, this practice increases the risk of alloimmunization. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of RBC antibodies among multiple-transfused thalassemic patients in southern Khorasan, the eastern side of Iran. For the purpose of screening unexpected antibodies, blood samples of 68 β-thalassemia major patients were investigated. After determining positive cases through screening phase, the process of antibody identification was carried out using reagent cells. The overall rate of alloimmunization was 2.9%, and the most frequent clinically important alloantibodies were anti-Kell and anti-Rh systems. Anti-K was detected in one of the patients. Furthermore, the simultaneous occurrence of anti-E and anti-C was seen in another study subject. A number of factors might have contributed to the low alloimmunization rate detected in this study, including the homogeneity of the population in South Khorasan, well-matched donors for those patients, first transfusion at an early age, and the use of leukodepleted blood."

This study aimed to assess the Hb increment in thalassaemia major patients transfused with leucoreduced PRBCs (LPRBCs) prepared by two different methods: (i) standard leucoreduced PRBCs (SLPRBCs) and (ii) leucoreduced PRBCs prepared by a new method where leucoreduction of whole blood is done first (NLPRBCs). This prospective, randomized, controlled trial included 80 adult thalassaemia major patients who were randomized into two groups of 40 each. Group I patients received SLPRBC and those of Group II received NLPRBC transfusions for 3 months. SLPRBCs had a mean (±SD) volume of 275.50 ± 17.07 mL, while it was 316.46 ± 1.42 mL for NLPRBCs (p < 0.001). The mean Hb content of SLPRBCs was 50.60 ± 5.12 g, while that of NLPRBCs was 56.98 ± 5.92 g (p < 0.001). The mean Hb increment in Group I patients was 2.11 ± 0.89 g/dL, while that of Group II patients was 2.48 ± 0.88 g/dL (p < 0.001). The mean transfusion interval for Group I patients was 20.30 ± 3.75 days, while it was 21.34 ± 5.13 days for Group II patients (p < 0.045). A significant positive correlation was observed between the Hb dose transfused and the Hb increment with both SLPRBC (ρ = 0.4, p < 0.001) and NLPRBC (ρ = 0.19, p = 0.011) transfusions. NLPRBCs had significantly higher Hb content than the SLPRBCs, leading to a better Hb increment post transfusion, which may potentially prolong the transfusion interval in thalassaemia major patients."

The aim was to reduce the turnaround time in conventional genotyping methods and provide a rapid and comprehensive solution for prenatal diagnosis, carrier screening, and genotyping of β-thalassemia patients. We devised a targeted NGS panel spanning an 80.4 kb region on chromosome 11, encompassing the beta-globin gene cluster and 5' locus control region. We also developed an advanced data analysis algorithm consisting of variant calling and depth plot analysis that facilitates simultaneous detection of SNVs and CNVs in a single run. The test panel and algorithm were validated with 14 in-house β-thalassemia carrier/patient samples and cross-checked against the HbVar database. We identified seven pathogenic SNVs and five CNVs within the beta-globin gene cluster in various combinations, such as heterozygous, homozygous, and compound heterozygous conditions. Additionally, the coordinates of 169 rare deletions and 11 fusion mutations reported in the HbVar database were checked to verify the theoretical ability of our developed gene panel to detect all the CNVs within the target region. The developed panel and NGS technology can detect both SNVs and CNVs in a single run and can also be utilized for prenatal diagnosis and carrier screening for hemoglobinopathies, underscoring its versatility and clinical utility."

Therefore, developing safe and effective therapeutic modalities for managing iron overload is critical, as current animal models inadequately replicate human conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intravenous iron dextran on hepatocyte morphology, liver iron concentration, and serum iron profile changes as a model for hemochromatosis. An experimental design with a post-test-only control group method was conducted using animal models. Fifty rats were used and divided into ten groups, nine received different intravenous doses of iron dextran: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, and 120 mg/kg body weight (BW) and a control group received no treatment. The results showed that intravenous iron dextran starting at a dose of 10 mg/kg BW caused significant changes in liver iron concentration while starting at 20 mg/kg BW significantly affected hepatocyte morphology, transferrin levels, unsaturated iron binding capacity, serum iron levels, and transferrin saturation. Intravenous iron dextran starting at 40 mg/kg BW resulted significant changes in the level of total iron binding capacity compared to control group. In conclusion, intravenous iron dextran significantly altered hepatocyte morphology, increased liver iron concentration, and modified the serum iron profile, reflecting changes that might be observed in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hematological disorder caused by mutations in the hemoglobin gene, often necessitating regular blood transfusions. These frequent transfusions exert continuous pressure on patients' immune systems. Despite extensive research on the hematological aspects of thalassemia, few studies have explored the immune status of these patients. In this study, we investigated the immune profiles of thalassemia patients using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We examined the transcriptomes of PBMCs from five severe thalassemia patients, five non-severe patients, and five healthy volunteers. After isolating PBMCs, we extracted total RNA and performed RNA sequencing using the NOVASEQ 6000 platform. We analyzed the raw counts to observe differential gene expression between thalassemia patients and healthy controls, as well as between severe and non-severe patients. Additionally, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to explore underlying immune conditions. The gene expression profile, along with GSEA, revealed a marked decrease in MHC-II-mediated antigen presentation. Notably, we identified, for the first time, the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NK cell-mediated eosinophil chemotaxis, suggesting a link to disease severity. Severe thalassemia patients also exhibited higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of the ABO gene in severe thalassemia patients, which may contribute to heightened immune reactions and an increased need for blood transfusions. Deconvolution of the RNA-seq data revealed lower abundances of CD4 T cells and monocytes in thalassemia patients. Thus, immune-modulating drugs could be explored as alternative therapeutic options for the management of thalassemia."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of third-generation sequencing (TGS) and a thalassemia (Thal) gene diagnostic kit in identifying Thal gene mutations. Blood samples (n = 119) with positive hematology screening results were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods and TGS on the PacBio-Sequel-II-platform, respectively. Out of the 119 cases, 106 cases showed fully consistent results between the two methods, with TGS identified HBA1/2 and HBB gene mutations in 82 individuals. Notably, TGS exhibited a 5.04% higher detection rate compared to PCR-based methods (68.91% vs. 63.87%). For HBA1/2 mutations, TGS accurately detected three types of rare HBA1/2 mutations (--THAI, HBA2:c.34A>C, and HBA1:c.354_355insATC), two types of rare HBA compound mutations (ɑWSɑ/ɑCap+23(C>G)ɑ and -ɑ3.7/ɑIVS-Ⅱ-34ɑ), and three rare triplicates of α-globin variants (ɑɑ/ɑɑɑanti3.7, --SEA/HKɑɑ, and ɑɑ/ɑɑɑanti4.2). For the HBB gene, TGS detected two rare HBB mutations, namely HBB:c.316-45G>C and HBB:c.170G>A. For these 13 cases of rare thalassemia gene mutations, most patients exhibited varying degrees of microcytic hypochromia. However, patients with mutation in HBA2:c.34A>C, HBA1:c.354_355insATC, and HBB:c.170G>A did not exhibit typical results in blood routine tests but had abnormal hemoglobin composition. Additionally, TGS confirmed the cis/trans configuration of 2 allelic gene mutations in one step. Compared to traditional genotyping methods, TGS increased the detection rate of positive HB gene mutations and identified rare Thal cases with variable phenotypes. For Thal screening, it is recommended to perform both blood routine tests and hemoglobin electrophoresis, combined with TGS, to minimize the risk of missed or incorrect diagnoses in clinical practice. Although TGS is currently more expensive than other methods, it pro-vides a comprehensive approach for Thal screening and clinical diagnosis, particularly for rare Thal variants. As sequencing throughput increases and costs decrease, TGS can be widely applied in the screening of genetic diseases."

From May 2017 to October 2023, a comparative analysis was conducted on pregnant women undergoing treatment at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University and the Second Nanning People's Hospital. The study included 42 cases of deletional HbB disease and 32 cases of non-deletional HbH disease. The study assessed blood routine, anemia, and pregnancy outcomes during early and late pregnancy. In the deletional group, there was a significantly higher incidence of moderate anemia during both early and late pregnancy compared to the non-deletional group. Moreover, the deletional group exhibited a significantly lower mean corpuscular volume (MCV) during early and late pregnancy and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) during late pregnancy, with statistically significant differences (<i>p</i><0.05) compared to the non-deletional group. Additionally, the non-deletional group had a significantly higher incidence of postpartum blood transfusion, fetal growth restriction (FGR), and low birth weight (LBW) compared to the deletional group, with a statistically significant difference (<i>p</i><0.05). Pregnant patients with alpha-thalassemia HbH disease and non-deletional HbH disease commonly experience moderate anemia, increasing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in non-deletional HbH disease cases where negative outcomes are more prevalent. It is crucial to enhance perinatal monitoring and intervention for pregnant women with HbH disease, including regular assessment of hemoglobin (Hb) levels, MCV, and MCH, and implementing measures to manage anemia to mitigate adverse pregnancy outcomes effectively."

This scoping review is aimed to understand obstacles faced by β-TM patients in Pakistan. For this review, 26 unique articles were identified by using the PRISMA flow guidelines. PubMed and Google Scholar were used with the MESH term Beta-Thalassemia Major AND Pakistan, and the duration was set between 2012-2022. Then, the reviewers created a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel to add in the data from the studies selected. Inductive and deductive approaches were used for thematic analysis. Additionally, we critically analyzed the current landscape of β-TM in Pakistan. The main challenges in β-TM care in Pakistan are suboptimal transfusion services and a poor complication management. Due to the need of chronic blood transfusions, transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI) incidence within this patient population is high. These largely include hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). TTIs impact the quality of life of these patients and their overall survival. Furthermore, psychosocial morbidities are also prevalent in β-TM patients, with increased levels of hostility, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, thus emphasizing the critical need for sustained psychological support. Access to quality treatments is constrained, with notable disparities between public and private sector hospitals. Additionally, the financial burden on β-TM patients is considerable, which contributes to economic strain and more hardships on the already suffering families. The review concludes that the absence of a unified national policy exacerbates these challenges, which results in an escalating burden of β-TM nationwide. To address these issues, essential recommendations include the following: the implementation of a standardized protocol for β-TM care, the enhancement of access to quality care, the provision of iron chelation therapy, and safeguarding safe blood transfusion practices. Prevention programs, along with increased public awareness and education about β-TM and carrier screening, are pivotal. Collaborative efforts with international partners and drawing insights from successful strategies in countries with similar β-TM burdens can aid in mitigating the overall impact of β-TM in Pakistan and improving the quality of life of the affected individuals."

    "title": "Inflammatory Monocyte Subsets Correlation with Iron Levels in Low Vitamin D Pediatric Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia experience iron dysregulation, which affects the immune response. Surface proteins such as FcγRIII (CD16), lipopolysaccharide receptor (CD14), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR) on monocytes are crucial for innate and adaptive responses. Blood monocytes, identified by their CD14 and CD16 expression, show functional diversity during injury or inflammation. Considering the mechanisms of vitamin D activation and its potential interaction with monocytes, further investigation of its immunomodulatory role in transfusion-dependent thalassemia is essential. This study evaluated monocyte subsets, population, and surface receptor expression (CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR), and their association with iron status and vitamin D levels in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Fifty lysed erythrocyte-heparinized whole blood samples from transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and classified into three monocyte subsets: CD14++CD16- (classical), CD14++CD16+ (intermediate), and CD14+CD16++ (non-classical). Cell percentage referred to the monocyte subset population. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) indicated surface protein expression. The 25(OH)vitamin D level was used to measure vitamin D levels. Iron status was assessed using ferritin and serum iron levels. A correlational study was performed. We did not find a correlation between low vitamin D levels (22.9 ng/mL ± 3.9) and monocyte characteristics, iron status, or hematology profile. However, we observed a negative correlation between the percentage of intermediate and non-classical monocytes and hemoglobin and ferritin levels (P = 0.02, r = -0.3; P = 0.04, r = -0.3). Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD14 in non-classical monocytes and serum iron (P = 0.04, r = 0.3). Our findings suggest that iron overload and anemia may influence the function of inflammatory monocyte subsets. Considering the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D through monocyte modulation during pathogen insult, further research utilizing a whole-blood stimulation assay is imperative."

    "abstract": "Many patients with β-thalassaemia die prematurely due to iron overload. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the triple combination of deferoxamine, deferasirox and deferiprone on iron chelation in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia with very high iron overload. This open-label, randomised, controlled clinical trial was conducted at Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Sri Lanka. Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients with ferritin >3500 ng/mL were randomised 2:1 into intervention (deferoxamine, deferasirox and deferiprone) and control (deferoxamine and deferasirox) arms. Reduction in serum ferritin after six months was the primary outcome measure. Reduction in liver iron content, improvement in cardiac T2∗, and adverse effects were secondary outcome measures. Twenty-three patients (intervention-15, control-8) were recruited. 92% and 62% in the intervention and control arms showed a reduction in ferritin, respectively. The mean reduction of ferritin was significantly higher in intervention (-1094 ± 907 ng/mL) compared to control (+82 ± 1588 ng/mL) arm (p = 0.042). There was no statistically significant difference in the liver iron content in two arms. In the intervention arm, 67% improved cardiac T2∗ (mean change +6.72 ± 9.63 ms) compared to 20% in the control arm (mean change -3.00 ± 8.24 ms). Five patients discontinued deferiprone due to arthralgia, which resolved completely after stopping the drug. Triple combination therapy with deferoxamine, deferasirox and deferiprone is more efficacious in reducing iron burden measured by serum ferritin and showed a positive trend in reducing myocardial iron content in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia with very high iron overload. Deferiprone has the disturbing side effect of reversible but severe arthropathy. None."

    "abstract": "Around 7% of the global population has congenital hemoglobin disorders, with over 300,000 new cases of α-thalassemia annually. Diagnosis is costly and inaccurate in low-income regions, often relying on complete blood count (CBC) tests. This study employs machine learning (ML) to classify α-thalassemia traits based on gender and CBC, exploring the effects of grouping silent- and non-carriers. The dataset includes 288 individuals with suspected α-thalassemia from Sri Lanka. It was classified using eleven discriminant formulae and nine ML models. Outliers were removed using Mahalanobis distance, and resampling was conducted with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and SMOTE-nominal continuous (NC). The Mann-Whitney U test handled feature extraction and class grouping. ML performance was evaluated with eight criteria. The Ehsani formula achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.66 by grouping silent- and non-carriers. The convolutional neural network (CNN) without feature extraction demonstrated better performance, with an accuracy of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.8, specificity of 0.86, and ROC-AUC of 0.95/0.93 (micro/macro). Performance was maintained even without preprocessing. ML models outperformed classical discriminant formulae in classifying α-thalassemia using sex and CBC features. A larger dataset could enhance ML model generalization and the impact of feature extraction. Grouping silent- and non-carriers improved ML results, especially with resampling. The silent carriers were not separable from non-carriers regarding the available features."

    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Cellular biobanks are of great interest for performing studies finalized in the development of personalized approaches for genetic diseases, including β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), important diseases affecting the hematopoietic system. These inherited genetic diseases are characterized by a global distribution and the need for intensive health care. The aim of this report is to present an update on the composition of a cellular Thal-Biobank, to describe its utilization since 2016, to present data on its application in studies on fetal hemoglobin induction and on gene editing, and to discuss its employment as a \"unique tool\" during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: The methods were as follows: freezing, cryopreservation, long-term storage, and thawing of erythroid precursor cells from β-thalassemia patients; fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction; CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing; HPLC analysis of the hemoglobin pattern. <b>Results</b>: The updated version of the Thal-Biobank is a cellular repository constituted of 990 cryovials from 221 β-thalassemia patients; the phenotype (pattern of hemoglobin production) is maintained after long-term storage; fetal hemoglobin induction and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be performed using biobanked cells. In representative experiments using an isoxazole derivative as HbF inducer, the HbF increased from 13.36% to more than 60%. Furthermore, in CRIPR/Cas9 gene editing, de novo production of HbA was obtained (42.7% with respect to the trace amounts found in untreated cells). <b>Conclusions</b>: The implemented Thal-Biobank was developed before the COVID-19 outbreak and should be considered a tool of great interest for researchers working on β-thalassemia, with the aim of developing innovative therapeutic protocols and verifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on erythroid precursor cells."

This study aimed to review the clinical trials conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in treating thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). We searched relevant literature using \"CRISPR Cas\", \"thalassemia\", \"sickle cell\" and \"clinical trial\" as subject terms in PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to December 3rd, 2023. Following the PIO format (Patients, Intervention, Outcome), PRISMA guidelines were followed in the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment processes. Out of 110 publications, 6 studies met our eligibility criteria with a total of 115 patients involved. CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to disrupt BCL11A gene enhancer in 4 studies and to disrupt γ-globin gene promoters in 2 studies. Patients demonstrated significant activation of fetal hemoglobin, elevated total hemoglobin, transfusion independence in thalassemia, and repression of vaso-occlusive episodes in SCD. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system to directly disrupt genes provides a safe and potential one-time functional cure for thalassemia and SCD, suggesting CRISPR/Cas9 as a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of inherited hematological disorders."

Allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the only curative treatment for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, but a lack of compatible donors prevents the use of this approach for most patients. Over the past 20 years, the rise of gene therapy and the development of lentiviral vectors and genome-editing tools has extended curative options to a broader range of patients.

We describe two fetuses from a single family with ALG8-CDG presenting with prenatal hydrops, undergoing comprehensive prenatal ultrasound, umbilical cord blood biochemistry, autopsy, placental pathology, and genetic testing. Prenatal ultrasound revealed fetal hydrops, skeletal anomalies, cardiac developmental abnormalities, cataracts, echogenic kidneys and bowel, oligohydramnios, choroid plexus cysts, and intrauterine growth restriction. Umbilical cord blood biochemistry demonstrated fetal anemia, coagulation disorders, and abnormal liver and kidney function. Autopsy confirmed fetal hydrops and associated anomalies. A novel compound heterozygous mutation comprising the missense variant c.754T>C (p.Ser252Pro) and a partial exonic deletion (deletion of exons 1-2) in the ALG8 gene was identified in fetus P2. This study represents the first prenatal diagnosis of ALG8-CDG, comprehensively delineating the prenatal phenotypic spectrum. Prenatal ultrasound, umbilical cord blood biochemistry, and placental pathology findings aid in the assessment of prenatal manifestations, invaluable for prenatal diagnosis, genetic counseling, and potential interventions in future patients."

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of Peripheral Neuropathy (using nerve conduction studies (NCS)) in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia aged between 5 to 18 years and to study its correlation with chronic anemia, ferritin levels, chelation status, annual transfusion requirement, deficiency of serum Vitamin B12, and Folate levels. In this hospital-based cross-sectional study, 100 eligible children were enrolled in a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi, India. Neurological examinations focusing on peripheral neuropathy followed by NCS were performed on all the patients. Age-wise cutoff values outside of 2.5 SD of normal were taken as abnormal. None of the children had clinical features of peripheral neuropathy, although 77% had abnormalities in NCS. Of these, 33% had pure motor nerve changes, 7% had pure sensory nerve changes, 1% had abnormal F responses, and 26% had mixed nerve changes. These changes correlated significantly with chronic anemia and duration of iron chelation but not with other factors. In children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia who do not exhibit any neurological signs or symptoms, however, it is not uncommon to observe abnormal NCS at an average hemoglobin (Hb) level of less than 9.5 g/dl. Further comprehensive case-control studies are necessary to determine if a more specific Hb target range of 9.5 to 10.5 g/dl is appropriate and to investigate the potential impact of chelation therapy on these changes."

    "title": "Hematologic Complications of Pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "Hematologic complications are common in pregnancy and can significantly impact both maternal and fetal health. Recognizing and treating these complications can be challenging due to the limited evidence available to guide clinical consultants. Iron deficiency anemia is the most prevalent hematologic issue in pregnancy and often occurs due to increased maternal blood volume and the nutritional demands of the growing fetus. Thrombocytopenia is the second most commonly occurring hematologic issue in pregnancy and can be associated with increased blood loss and complications during childbirth. However, the most common type of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is gestational thrombocytopenia, which does not typically require clinical management. Thus, it is important to distinguish gestational thrombocytopenia from other etiologies of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy that require immediate treatment, including immune thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, preeclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet levels) syndrome. Other important hematologic conditions in pregnancy include non-inherited anemias, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia, as well as inherited anemias, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, which may require specialized management to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes. Additionally, bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease and hemophilia, pose unique challenges in pregnancy, especially around the time of delivery, due to the risk of excessive bleeding. Lastly, thromboembolic disorders, such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), remain the leading cause of mortality in pregnancy in developed countries. Pregnancy-related hormonal changes, venous stasis, and hypercoagulability contribute to an increased thromboembolic risk, further exacerbated by additional risk factors such as obesity or a prior personal or family history of VTE. This review aims to summarize current guidelines and management of the most common hematologic disorders in pregnancy."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to establish an iron overload rat model to simulate the elevated iron levels in patients with thalassemia and to investigate the potential association between hippocampal iron deposition and cognition. Two groups of iron overloaded rats and one group of control rats were used for this study. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to test spatial reference memory indicated by escape latency time and number of MWM platform crossings. The magnetic susceptibility value of the hippocampal tissue, a measure of iron deposition, was assessed by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and was correlated with spatial reference memory performance. The iron content in hippocampal tissue sections of the rats were assessed using diaminobenzidine (DAB)-enhanced Perl's Prussian blue (PPB) staining. The rat groups with iron overload including the Group H and Group L had higher hippocampal magnetic susceptibility values than the control rat group, i.e., Group D. In addition, the iron overloaded groups had longer MWM escape latency than the control group, and reduced number of MWM platform crossings. There was a positive correlation between the mean escape latency and the mean hippocampal magnetic susceptibility value, a negative correlation between the number of platform crossings and the mean hippocampal magnetic susceptibility value, and a negative correlation between the number of platform crossings and the latent escape time in Group H and Group L. This rat model simulating iron overload in thalassemia showed hippocampal iron overload being associated with impairment of spatial reference memory. QSM could be used to quantify brain iron overload in vivo, highlighting its potential clinical application for assessing cognitive impairment in patients with thalassemia."

This study examines the long-term complications, survival rates, and causes of mortality among adult patients with TDT who have undergone splenectomy in a low and middle-income country (LMIC). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 103 adult TDT patients (≥18 years) who underwent splenectomy between July 2013 and March 2024. Data collected included demographic and clinical characteristics, haematological parameters, transfusion requirements before splenectomy and at the last follow-up, survival rates, complications, and mortality causes. The median age at splenectomy was 12 years (range 5-34). The majority (98 %) underwent open splenectomy. The yearly transfusion volume decreased from 276.7 ml/kg/year pre-splenectomy (range 207-433) to 146.2 (range 0-252.9) post-splenectomy at the last follow-up, p < 0.0001. Three patients were completely transfusion-free at the last follow-up. Complications included pulmonary hypertension in 10 (9.7 %), thrombosis in 5 (4.8 %), and overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) in 4 (3.9 %). The iron-overload-related complications included cardiomyopathy in 17 (16.5 %), endocrinopathy in 56 (54.3 %), chronic liver disease in 15 (14.5 %) and hepatocellular carcinoma in 2 (0.9 %). The 15-year post-splenectomy overall survival (OS) was 84.7 % (95 % CI- 77.3 % - 92.8 %), with 17 deaths (16.5 %) recorded. Iron-overload-related cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of death in 8 (53.3 %). Splenectomy significantly reduces transfusion requirements in TDT patients but is associated with risks such as thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, and OPSI. Long-term mortality is primarily driven by iron-overload-related cardiomyopathy."

We report a case of a 30-year-old woman at 37<sup>+6</sup> gestation with a history of thalassaemia intermedia and splenectomy. During pregnancy, she had been managed with frequent blood transfusions and enoxaparin. She was admitted for induction of labour, and during labour, she developed pre-eclampsia with severe features. Despite magnesium sulphate therapy, she had a short self-terminating seizure shortly after an epidural had been sited. A decision to proceed with an urgent caesarean birth under epidural anaesthesia was made. After birth, she had another seizure associated with oxygen desaturation. Bag-valve-mask ventilation was insufficient, prompting conversion to general anaesthesia and tracheal intubation, after which cardiac collapse developed. Resuscitation was initiated and bedside cardiac ultrasound revealed a large clot-in-transit through the right atrium and ventricle, prompting immediate transfer to cardiac theatres for thrombectomy. The thrombus was successfully removed. The patient recovered well and her trachea was extubated the next day. She was discharged in a stable condition 8 days later. This case highlights the critical role of point-of-care ultrasound in the prompt diagnosis of life-threatening conditions and guiding emergency interventions."

At the age of 9 years, genetic analysis was conducted using PCR-reverse dot blot (PCR-RDB), Sanger sequencing, and third-generation nanopore sequencing. Sanger sequencing identified a triple heterozygous mutation in the β-globin gene: -28(A > G) (<i>HBB</i>:c.-78A > G), IVS-I-5(G > A) (<i>HBB</i>:c0.92 + 5G > A), and CD 71/72(+A) (<i>HBB</i>:c.216_217insA). Nanopore sequencing further confirmed the genotype as β<sup>-28(A>G), IVS-I-5(G>A)</sup>/β<sup>CD 71/72(+A)</sup>. The combination of these mutations represents a rare β-thalassemia genotype in China, contributing to the β-globin gene mutation database for the Chinese population.

A retrospective study was conducted on 7 patients diagnosed by Yangjiang People's Hospital and Guangzhou Hybribio Co. Ltd., from June 2019 to October 2022. Routine blood tests and hemoglobin electrophoresis were carried out. Potential variants were identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with Reverse dot blotting (RDB), Gap-PCR, and Sanger sequencing. This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of People's Hospital of Yangjiang (Ethics No: 20240001). For the 7 patients, results of blood routine test of one case was unknown, and that of another was normal. The remaining 5 cases had presented with microcytic hypochromic anemia. The results of hemoglobin electrophoresis showed that one case had normal Hb A and slightly lower Hb A2, whilst another had significantly decreased Hb A and Hb A2, in addition with the appearance of a Hb H band. The content of Hb Bart's in four neonates was ≥ 0.4%. The remaining one case had no result. Genetic testing has identified 4 rare start codon mutations, namely HBA2: c.2delT, HBA2: c.1A>G, HBA2: c.1A>T, and HBA1: c.2T>C. Among these, Patient 1 had harbored compound heterozygous variants of HBA2: c.427T>C (Hb CS) and HBA2: c.2delT. Patient 4 had harbored compound heterozygous variants of HBA2: c.1A>G and Southeast Asian type deletion. Heterozygotes with HBA start codon variants usually present as silent or mild thalassemia, and the symptoms of anemia may deteriorate when combined with other α-thalassemia variant. The HBA2: c.1A>T start codon variant was unreported previously in China.

To address this issue in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, a total of 12526 individuals (6263 couples) attending three main Premarital Screening centers were enrolled. Individuals were labeled as β-hemoglobin disorders based on full blood counts and high-performance liquid chromatography. For those identified as β-thalassemia trait, molecular characterization was achieved by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization, followed by next-generation sequencing where appropriate. The prevalence of β-thalassemia and δβ-thalassemia traits were 3.5% and 0.01% respectively. For structural variants: sickle cell, hemoglobin D, C, and E traits were documented in 0.37%, 0.07%, 0.05%, and 0.04% respectively. Twenty-two couples were identified as couples at risk of having affected babies with hemoglobinopathies (3.5/1000). A total of 23 different β-thalassemia mutations were identified in studied samples, the eight most frequent of which were IVS-II-I (G > A), IVS-I-110 (G > A), IVS-I-6 (T > C), Codon 44 (-C), IVS-I-5 (G > C), IVS-I-1 (G > A), IVS-I-130 (G > C), and IVS-II-745 (C > G), accounting for 74.7% of the total mutations. In conclusion, the study illustrates the heterogeneity of β-thalassemia mutations in Iraq's capital, and identified several service indicators for prevention. Accordingly, it constitutes an important step in the setup for an effective prevention program of hemoglobinopathies."

HEV infection is mainly transmitted via the fecal-oral route; however, parenteral transmission through blood components has been reported in both developing and developed countries. Although HEV infection is typically self-limiting, immunocompromised individuals, patients with chronic liver disease, and thalassemic patients are at a heightened risk of contracting the infection and may develop chronic hepatitis and life-threatening complications that require treatment. The reported prevalence rates of HEV in thalassemia patients vary significantly by country. Age, gender, residential area, and the cumulative amount of blood transfusions received have been identified as associated risk factors for HEV infection. In order to enhance blood safety and ensure the protection of vulnerable patient populations, such as thalassemia patients, several countries have introduced universal or targeted HEV screening policies in blood donations. Other preventive measures include vigilant monitoring of thalassemic patients and screening for anti-HEV antibodies. The aim of this review is to explore the prevalence, risk factors, clinical impact and management of HEV infection in patients with thalassemia."

    "title": "Asthma Is an Independent Risk Factor for Acute Chest Syndrome in Children with Sickle Cell Disease in French Guiana.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The overall incidence of asthma in children with sickle cell disease in French Guiana is unknown. Asthma is common in children with sickle cell disease and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to describe the impact of asthma on the occurrence of acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease who were followed up in French Guiana. <b>Methods:</b> We performed a multicenter nested case-control study between January 2012 and December 2022. Our study population consisted of children, aged between 6 months and 18 years, who were diagnosed with sickle cell disease at birth and hospitalized at least once for acute chest syndrome during the study period. <b>Results:</b> A total of 588 children were followed up for sickle cell disease. Of these, 390 had sickle cell disease, 180 had SC, and 18 had Sβ + thalassemia. Of the 390-sickle cell disease, we identified 35 who also had asthma, giving an estimated prevalence of asthma of 8.9% among children with sickle cell disease in French Guiana. Only asthma was significantly associated with acute chest syndrome (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of asthma in children with sickle cell disease is underestimated. Asthma is an independent risk factor for acute chest syndrome. Given the seriousness of asthma in children with sickle cell disease, systematic screening for asthma in children with sickle cell disease has been implemented. This screening, which will be evaluated after one year, will help to better characterize asthmatic children with sickle cell disease and improve their care."

This study compared CMR parameters, quantified by cine SSFP sequences, in 48 adult SCD patients without apparent cardiac involvement (defined by the absence of known risk factors, normal electrocardiogram, and no macroscopic myocardial fibrosis or significant cardiac iron on T2* CMR) to matched cohorts of 96 healthy controls and 96 thalassemia major (TM) patients without cardiac damage. Nine paediatric SCD patients were also analysed and compared to age- and gender-matched groups of nine TM patients and nine healthy subjects. In all groups, studied males displayed higher biventricular volumes and mass indexes than females. Male SCD patients showed significantly higher left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), LV end-systolic volume index (ESVI), LV stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index, LV and right ventricular (RV) mass index, and atrial areas than healthy subjects. Females with SCD exhibited increased LV EDVI, LV SVI, RV mass index, and left atrial area index compared to healthy controls. SCD and TM patients showed comparable biatrial areas and biventricular volumes and function. When compared to TM, SCD males exhibited a larger mass index, while SCD females showed an increased RV mass index. CMR parameters were similar across all paediatric groups. By establishing the biatrial and biventricular reference ranges through CMR for adult male and female SCD patients, we aimed to prevent possible misdiagnosis of cardiomyopathy in this population by taking into account cardiac adaptation due to anaemia."

    "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia (BTH), a genetic disorder resulting from beta-globin gene mutations, affects over 1.5 million people globally. The disorder's multifactorial impact on male fertility, particularly through oxidative stress (OS), warrants focused study. This review examines the mechanisms of OS in TM, its implications for male infertility, and the potential of antioxidant therapies to mitigate fertility challenges. A non-systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Cochrane, and Medscape databases, focusing on studies on beta-thalassemia (BTH), erectile dysfunction (ED), hormonal alterations, and OS. Studies were screened based on relevance, language, and topic, with 71 articles meeting the inclusion criteria after removing duplicates. The findings reveal that OS, exacerbated by iron overload from regular blood transfusions, is significantly associated with impaired sperm quality and fertility in patients with TM. Iron toxicity affects gonadotropin levels, reduces sperm quality, and contributes to hypogonadism. Additionally, antioxidant therapies show promise in reducing OS-induced sperm damage, though efficacy is limited by a lack of robust clinical trials. OS plays a considerable role in male infertility among patients with TM, primarily through iron-induced sperm damage and hormonal disruptions. While antioxidant therapies may offer a partial remedy, further research is necessary to understand OS's mechanisms in TM and develop effective fertility treatments. This review highlights the need for personalized antioxidant approaches to improve reproductive outcomes in this population."

Osteoporosis management in Thalassemia is challenging because several factors contributing to its pathogenesis should be considered and controlled starting from child- hood. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial. Evidence concerning the efficacy of available anti-osteoporosis drugs in thalassemic patients is scarce. In this scenario, clinical experience and center resources often guide the treatment choice. More efforts should be made to share knowledge in this field in order to indicate specific treatment strategies for TAO management. We performed a literature search in Pubmed from 1992 to March 2024 using the words Thalassemia and: osteoporosis, Bisphosphonates, Denosumab, Teriparatide, Romosozumab, hormone replacement therapy, growth hormone, hypogonadism, calcium, vitamin D, bone disease, sarcopenia.

    "abstract": "The traditional use of Moringa oleifera (MO), an essential food source in Africa and Asia, to cure various diseases dates back thousands of years. This study examines the aqueous and ethanolic leaf extracts of MO's in vitro anti-leukemia capabilities. After preparing aqueous and ethanolic MO leaf extracts, cells were treated with various concentrations for 48 h. Cell viability was measured via MTT assay, and apoptotic pathways were analyzed using flow cytometry and Annexin V-PI staining. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, cells were exposed to the IC50 (150 µg/ml) for 48 h. Real-time PCR assessed the expression of P21, P53, BCL2, and Survivin genes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) served as the control group. MO aqueous and ethanol extracts showed cytotoxicity, with cancer cells being more sensitive. Flow cytometry confirmed higher apoptotic activity in Jurkat and Raji cells compared to PBMCs. The extracts increased P21 expression in Jurkat cells but did not significantly affect P53, BCL2, or Survivin. Similarly, in Raji cells, P21, BCL2, and Survivin were elevated, while P53 remained unchanged. Gene expression in healthy PBMCs was unaffected by the extracts. This study shows that leukemia cells (Raji and Jurkat) are more sensitive to MO's aqueous and ethanolic extracts than healthy cells. The results suggest developing MO extracts as a cutting-edge leukemia treatment."

    "abstract": "Reactivating the embryonic ζ-globin gene represents a potential therapeutic approach to ameliorate the severe clinical phenotype of α-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. The transcription factor MYB has been extensively proven to be a master regulator of the γ-globin gene, but its role in the regulation of ζ-globin remains incompletely understood. Here, we report a mechanistic study on the derepression of ζ-globin both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. We show that MYB depletion in mouse models and human hematopoietic stem cells leads to consistent and remarkable reactivation of ζ-globin. Furthermore, multiomics analysis and functional validation of <i>MYB</i>-knockout and wild-type cell lines reveal that ETO2 functions as a novel repressor of ζ-globin through coordination with NuRD nucleosome remodeling and the deacetylation complex to modulate histone deacetylation of ζ-globin. Additionally, we evaluate the clinical significance of these findings by knocking out <i>ETO2</i> in primary CD34 <sup>+</sup> cells from nondeletional hemoglobin H patients, which results in a significant increase in ζ-globin expression. The RNA-seq data reveal that key erythroid genes are more co-regulated by <i>Myb</i> and <i>Eto2</i> than by <i>Myb</i> and <i>Klf1</i>, highlighting a distinctly enhanced erythroid-specific transcriptional impact within the MYB-ETO2 regulatory axis. Compared with <i>ETO2</i> knockout alone, codepletion of <i>ETO2</i> and <i>BCL11A</i> did not significantly activate ζ-globin, suggesting that the MYB-ETO2 pathway primarily silences ζ-globin. Our study reveals a linear MYB-ETO2 signaling pathway crucial for ζ-globin repression and offers new targets for treating α-thalassemia and sickle cell disease."

    "abstract": "Identifying novel targets for molecular radiosensitization is critical for improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) radiotherapy. Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX), a member of the SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling protein family, functions in the maintenance of genomic integrity and the regulation of apoptosis and senescence. However, whether ATRX is directly involved in the radiosensitivity of CRC remains unclear. Our results showed that silencing ATRX increased the radiosensitivity of HCT116 CRC cells, which was further strengthened when p53 was depleted. To explore the potential mechanism, we focused on the impact of the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage response (DDR), apoptosis, and senescence and the activation of the Daxx/MDM2/p53 pathway caused by ATRX loss. The results showed that IR induced DNA damage and G2/M arrest after depleting ATRX, especially in p53-depleted HCT116 cells, and inhibited ATM/Chk2 pathway activation, indicating that ATRX loss leads to failure of triggering the ATM/Chk2 pathway. Accordingly, ATRX loss promotes cell apoptosis and attenuates cell senescence. Interestingly, our results indicate that ATRX loss upregulates p53 function via the Daxx/MDM2 pathway to mediate radiosensitivity. Thus, ATRX may represent a novel radiosensitizing target for CRC, particularly p53-deficient CRC."

    "abstract": "The most severe form of α-thalassemia results from loss of all four copies of α-globin. Postnatally, patients face challenges similar to β-thalassemia, including severe anemia and erythrotoxicity due to the imbalance of β-globin and α-globin chains. Despite progress in genome editing treatments for β-thalassemia, there is no analogous curative option for α-thalassemia. To address this, we designed a Cas9/AAV6-mediated genome editing strategy that integrates a functional α-globin gene into the β-globin locus in α-thalassemia patient-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Incorporation of a truncated erythropoietin receptor transgene into the α-globin integration cassette significantly increased erythropoietic output from edited HSPCs and led to the most robust production of α-globin, and consequently hemoglobin tetramers. By directing edited HSPCs toward increased production of clinically relevant erythroid cells, this approach has the potential to mitigate the limitations of current treatments for the hemoglobinopathies, including low genome editing and low engraftment rates."

The Betriebskrankenkasse (BKKs) Database was used to identify patients with SCD or TDT. To be eligible for inclusion, patients with SCD were required to have ≥ 2 VOCs/year in any two consecutive years and ≥ 12 months of available data before and after the index date (second VOC in the second consecutive year). Patients with TDT were required to have ≥ 8 red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) in any 12-month period and ≥ 12 months of available data after the index date (first RBCT). Clinical and HCRU outcomes were analyzed during follow-up. Overall, 84 patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs and 68 patients with TDT were identified in the BKKs database. Among patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs, the most prevalent complications were retinopathy (45.2%), multisystem organ disease/failure (40.5%), and mental health complications (31.0%); among patients with TDT, they were endocrine (69.1%) and cardiopulmonary (55.9%) complications and malignancies (44.1%). Patients with SCD experienced a mean of 4.0 (standard deviation [SD] 3.9) VOCs and 1.9 (SD 2.5) hospitalizations per patient per year (PPPY) during follow-up. Patients with TDT had a mean (SD) of 16.4 (11.2) RBCTs and 59.4 (40.8) outpatient visits PPPY.

    "abstract": "Early missed abortion is defined as a pregnancy of ≤ 12 weeks in which there is a cessation of life in the developing embryo or fetus, leading to its retention within the uterine cavity without being spontaneously expelled promptly. This condition is commonly observed and significantly impacts human reproductive health. This study aimed to identify key genes related to ferroptosis that could serve as novel biomarkers for early missed abortion. Findings from gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicate a correlation between iron- DEFRGS in key modules and the p53 signaling, mitophagy-animal, and protein digestion and absorption pathways. An analysis of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted on DEFRGs, identifying five central genes (TP53, EZH2, TIMP1, SLC3A2, and GABARAPL2) using STRING and Cytohubba ROC curves. The expression of pivotal genes in both the missed-abortion and control groups was verified by RT-qPCR. CIBERSORT analysis revealed a notable increase in the infiltration levels of CD8 + T lymphocytes and M2 macrophages among individuals in the early missed abortion group. Additionally, a ceRNA network was constructed to predict interactions between mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA of the central genes. However, the interacting miRNAs predicted for SLC3A2 in the miRanda, miRDB, and TargetScan databases were limited to hsa-miR-661 and hsa-miR-4311, with no interacting lncRNAs found in the spongeScan database. This research has identified novel genes that could be targeted for the early detection and management of missed abortions."

    "abstract": "Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is often refractory and relapsing, leading to increased mortality post-HSCT. We retrospectively analyzed the cases of patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) who underwent allo-HSCT to study their clinical features, the occurrence of AIHA post-HSCT, and treatment response and to explore the possible pathogenesis of AIHA. A total of 113 patients were registered in the study, out of whom 14 developed AIHA following allo-HSCT, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 12.4%. The median age at HSCT was 5 (range: 2-14) years, and the median time of occurrence was 8 (range: 4-17) months after HSCT. Patients who are less than 4 years old at the time of HSCT (P = 0.032) exhibit a higher incidence of AIHA. Compared to patients without AIHA, AIHA patients demonstrate a lower percentage of B lymphocytes at the first 100 days (day + 100) post-HSCT(P = 0.002). There were no statistically significant differences in gender, unrelated donors, HLA incomplete mismatch, iron overload, ABO incompatibility, cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). When AIHA occurred, the absolute value of regulatory T cells decreased without a clear reduction in the proportion of CD4 + cells, and there was no significant elevation of interleukin-17. Eventually, 78.6% (11/14) of patients achieved complete remission with corticosteroids and rituximab, and patients who failed were efficacious with the bortezomib in combination with corticosteroids. Four patients experienced relapse, with one of them relapsing twice. Two patients relapsed after bortezomib and subsequently achieved remission with retreatment using a combination of corticosteroids and rituximab. All AIHA patients were alive and without relapse at the follow-up cutoff. Patients suffering from TDT are more prone to developing AIHA following allo-HSCT, potentially due to a disruption in the reconstitution balance of T and B lymphocytes. Despite the high incidence, the response to treatment was excellent. For relapsed/refractory patients, alternate therapy with bortezomib and rituximab may be considered."

    "title": "Circulating biomarkers associated with pediatric sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS), causing red blood cells to deform into a sickle shape. These deformed cells can block blood flow, leading to complications like chronic hemolysis, anemia, severe pain episodes, and organ damage. SCD genotypes include HbSS, HbSC (HbC is an abnormal variant of hemoglobin), and HbS/β-thalassemia. Sickle cell trait (SCT), HbAS, represents the carrier state, while other hemoglobin variants include HbCC, HbAC, and the normal HbAA. Over 7.5 million people worldwide live with SCD, with a high mortality rate in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana. Despite its prevalence, SCD is underdiagnosed and poorly managed, especially in children. Characterized by intravascular hemolysis, SCD leads to oxidative stress, endothelial activation, and systemic inflammation. Identifying circulating blood biomarkers indicative of organ damage and systemic processes is vital for understanding SCD and improving patient management. However, research on biomarkers in pediatric SCD is limited and few have been identified and validated. This study explores specific circulating biomarkers in pediatric SCD in Ghana (West Africa), hypothesizing that inflammatory and neuronal injury markers in children with SCD could predict disease outcomes. Clinical data were collected from 377 children aged 3-8 years with various Hb genotypes, including SCD and SCT, at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana (2021-2022). A total of 80 age- and sex-matched subjects were identified. A cross-sectional study utilized a multiplexed immunoassay procedure to evaluate serum biomarkers, including cytokines, chemokines, vascular injury markers, systemic inflammation markers, cell-free heme scavengers, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and angiogenic factors. Elevated levels of BDNF, Ang-2, CXCL10, CCL11, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL12p40, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, Tie-2, and VEGFA were observed in HbSS subjects, correlating with hemoglobin level, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts. Heme scavengers like HO-1, hemopexin, and haptoglobin also correlated with these parameters. ROC and AUC analyses demonstrated the potential of these biomarkers in predicting SCD outcomes. These findings suggest that there are significant differences between biomarker expression among the different genotypes examined. We conclude that a predictive algorithm based on these biomarkers could be developed and validated through longitudinal assessment of within-genotype differences and correlation of the data with disease severity or outcomes. With such a tool one can enhance SCD management and improve patient outcomes. This approach may pave the way for personalized interventions and better clinical care for pediatric SCD patients."

    "abstract": "Iron overload has been associated with cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment in β-thalassaemia patients, typically appearing earlier than in the general population. However, the mechanisms of iron overload on cerebrovascular pathology remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of heavy iron overload on the blood-brain barrier and neurohistology, particularly in the CA3 region of hippocampus and its contribution to cognitive impairment in β-thalassaemia mice. Three-month-old female β-thalassaemia and wild-type mice received iron dextran via intraperitoneal injection to induce heavy iron overload. While β-thalassaemia mice with low baseline iron show cognitive impairment at 22 months, equivalent to 70-80 human years, heavy iron overload accelerated cognitive decline, leading to impaired spatial learning and memory by 12 months, equivalent to 35-40 human years, in both β-thalassaemia and wild-type mice. Iron-loaded mice have reduced hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons and significant iron accumulation in blood vessels, with no increase in neuronal iron levels. A significant decrease in ZO-1, a tight junction protein, indicated decreased blood-brain barrier integrity and potential iron leakage into the brain. While iron-loading had no effect on astrocytes, elevated Iba1 expression in microglia suggests microglia activation as a protective response. However, persistent iron overload may lead to chronic neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. These results underscore the critical role of iron overload in accelerating cognitive decline in β-thalassaemia and suggest that regular monitoring of iron levels and chelation therapy may help prevent early cognitive impairment, ultimately improving the quality of life for β-thalassaemia patients."

While its symptoms are typically self-limiting in healthy individuals, B19V can cause or exacerbate autoimmune diseases in vulnerable patients. This review integrates the involvement of B19V in the development and worsening of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), hematological disorders (thalassemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), vasculitis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), dermatological disease (systemic sclerosis, psoriasis), autoimmune thyroid disease, myocarditis, and myasthenia gravis, and autoinflammatory disease of adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD). B19V contributes to autoimmunity and autoimmune disease onset and progression through mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, immune system disruption, and chronic infection. By summarizing findings from in vitro experiments, clinical case studies, seroprevalence data, and biopsy results, this review highlights the critical connection between B19V and autoimmune disease development. Recognizing the role of B19V in the early diagnosis and management of these conditions is essential, as its presence may influence the disease course and severity. Greater awareness among healthcare professionals and the public is necessary to address the impact of B19V, leading to more accurate diagnoses and better-informed treatment approaches for autoimmune diseases linked to the virus."

ATRX was originally identified as the monogenic cause of X-linked α-thalassemia mental retardation (ATR-X) syndrome. Affected individuals display a variety of developmental abnormalities and skeletal deformities. Studies from others investigated the role of ATRX in skeletal development by tissue-specific Atrx knockout. However, the impact of ATRX during early skeletal development has not been examined. Using preosteoblast-specific Atrx conditional knockout mice, we observed increased trabecular bone mass and decreased osteoclast number in bone. In vitro coculture of Atrx conditional knockout bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with WT splenocytes showed impaired osteoclast differentiation. Additionally, Atrx deletion was associated with decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (Rankl)/ osteoprotegerin (Opg) expression ratio in BMSCs. Notably, Atrx-deficient osteolineage cells expressed high levels of the neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide (Cartpt). Mechanistically, ATRX suppresses Cartpt transcription by binding to the promoter, which is otherwise poised for Cartpt expression by RUNX2 binding to the distal enhancer. Finally, Cartpt silencing in Atrx conditional knockout BMSCs rescued the molecular phenotype by increasing the Rankl/Opg expression ratio. Together, our data show a potent repressor function of ATRX in restricting Cartpt expression during skeletal development."

From 15 patients, paired samples were collected during both steady-state and vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) and from 23 SCD patients longitudinal samples were collected before and after treatment with either voxelotor (n = 10), hydroxyurea (n = 8) or allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (n = 5). Fifty plasma proteins were differentially expressed in steady-state SCD patients as compared to HC. These included proteins involved in angiogenesis (i.e. ANGPT1, ANGPT2 and VEGFA), the IL-18 signalling pathway (i.e. IL-6, IL-10, IL-18), T-cell activation (i.e. LAG3, PDCD1) and natural killer (NK)-cell activation (CD244, NCR1, GZMB). While proteins involved in angiogenesis and the IL-18 signalling pathway were further upregulated during VOE, levels of several proteins involved in the IL-18 pathway, T-cell and NK-cell activation and angiogenesis, restored towards levels detected in HCs after curative or disease-modifying treatment. These findings might contribute to a better understanding of SCD pathophysiology and identifying potential new targets for therapeutic interventions."

We conducted a comprehensive search across four major databases-Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. All the studies that assessed the performance of radiomics and/or end-to-end DL models for predicting glioma ATRX status were included. Quality assessment was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) criteria and the METhodological RadiomICs Score (METRICS). Pooled estimates for performance metrics were calculated. I-squared was used to assess heterogeneity, while subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to find its potential sources. Publication bias was assessed using Deeks' funnel plots. Seventeen and eleven studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Most of the studies had a low risk of bias and low concern for applicability according to the QUADAS-2. Also, most of them had good quality according to the METRICS. Meta-analysis showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.80 (95%CI: 0.71-0.96), a specificity of 0.82 (95%CI: 0.67-0.93), a positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR) of 6.77 (95%CI: 4.67-9.82), a negative DLR of 0.15 (95%CI: 0.06-0.38), a diagnostic odds ratio of 30.36 (95%CI: 15.87-58.05), and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95%CI: 0.89-0.94). Subgroup analysis revealed significant intergroup differences based on several factors. Radiomics models can accurately predict ATRX status in gliomas, enhancing non-invasive tumor characterization and guiding treatment strategies."

    "title": "Association of Serum Ferritin With Growth and Endocrine Function in Thalassemia Major Children in North India: An Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Background Thalassemia is the most common form of hereditary anemia caused by the impaired synthesis of one of the two globin chains in hemoglobin. A decrease in beta-globin chains occurs in beta-thalassemia, resulting in a relative excess of alpha-globin chains. Thalassemia major is the severe form of thalassemia, which requires frequent blood transfusions for survival. Consequently, the natural course of the disease is affected by blood transfusion-related side effects. Repeated blood transfusions lead to the accumulation of iron in tissues such as the liver, heart, and endocrine glands. Serum ferritin is a biomarker of iron overload. Endocrinopathies are among the most frequently observed complications in thalassemia. Early recognition and treatment are important in order to prevent late irreversible sequelae and improve the quality of life of these patients. This study was conducted to evaluate growth parameters and endocrine function in children with thalassemia major and their relation with serum ferritin. Methods This prospective observational study included all patients between the age groups six months and 14 years with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. We included 62 children admitted during the study period fulfilling eligibility criteria. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and making comparisons among various groups. Spearman correlation analysis was done to assess the correlation between serum ferritin and thyroid hormone. The difference of means across the groups was tested with the Mann-Whitney U test for two groups and the Kruskal-Wallis test for more than two groups. Results The mean age of the study participants was 5.66 ± 3.77 years, with the largest group consisting of children aged one to three years, comprising 40.3% of the participants. The majority of participants were boys. This study showed a high prevalence of endocrinopathies in transfusion-dependent thalassemic patients. The most common endocrinopathy was short stature (37.1%), followed by impaired glucose tolerance (28.6%), subclinical hypothyroidism (14.5%), and parathyroid dysfunction (14.5%). Overt diabetes and pubertal delay were not seen. A statistically significant association of ferritin was found with age (p < 0.001), stature (p = 0.001), thryroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (p = 0.004), and parathyroid function (p = 0.006). Conclusions The prevalence of endocrinopathies in present transfusion-dependent thalassemic cohorts was considerably high, presenting as short stature, impaired glucose tolerance, hypoparathyroidism, and subclinical hypothyroidism. The study showed a weak positive correlation of endocrinopathies with serum ferritin levels. Hence, irrespective of serum ferritin levels, patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia can have a considerably high prevalence of endocrine complications."

    "abstract": "Anti-IH is a common cold agglutinin that is typically clinically insignificant. We present a case that resulted in hemolysis. A 32-year-old male patient with transfusion-independent beta-thalassemia intermedia presented with symptomatic anemia. His blood sample typed as group B, D+ and demonstrated multiple alloantibodies and cold autoantibodies. He was transfused uneventfully, but re-presented 10 days later with recurrent, worsening anemia. At this time, transfusion of group O, phenotype-matched red blood cells (RBCs) resulted in an acute hemolytic reaction. While anemia was initially attributed to drug-mediated bone marrow toxicit y and subsequently to a delayed hemolytic reaction, further evaluation revealed <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infection and a cold agglutinin (anti-IH specificity), indicating a likely autoimmune-mediated anemia due to an infectious etiology. Subsequent transfusion of 2 group B, phenotype-matched RBC units using a blood warmer was uneventful. Anti-IH is only rarely associated with hemolytic transfusion reactions, which may be exacerbated when transfusing group O RBC units to group B patients. <i>M. pneumoniae</i> infection likely led to cold agglutinin-mediated hemolysis of endogenous and transfused RBCs. The patient was successfully managed with intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, rituximab, erythropoietin, hydroxyurea, and amoxicillin clavulanate/azithromycin. This case illustrates the importance of infectious disease evaluation in patients with unexplained anemia, the potential clinical significance of autoanti-IH, and the value of providing type-specific RBC units in these circumstances."

    "title": "Transfusion History Is More Predictive Than Serum Ferritin Level in Prediction of Hypothyroidism in Transfusion Dependent Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients require a regular blood transfusion to survive. Without adequate transfusion support, they suffer many complications, and have a short life span. Near about 200 milligrams of iron remains within a single Red cell concentrate (RCC) unit. So, blood transfusion acts as a double-edged sword, prolonging life while eventually leading to iron overload. For patients who are receiving transfusions for several years, iron accumulation causes different types of morbidity including thyroid failure. Though serum ferritin is a simple tool for measuring the iron load of the body, it is often misleading. Because, in first 100 unit of blood transfusion serum ferritin levels increase steadily. After that, this relation is not simple. Serum ferritin may increase in chronic inflammation or decrease in vitamin C deficiency, which may be misleading. The study aimed to identify a simple predictor of hypothyroidism in TDT patients. This cross-sectional study conducted from April 2018 to September 2019 includes 64 TDT patients according to selection criteria. Among them 43 were male and 21 were female TDT patients, with a mean age of 25.5 years. Body iron load was estimated by serum ferritin level. Pearson correlation test was done to measure the correlation of serum TSH level with serum ferritin, unit of blood transfused so far and duration of receiving transfusion therapy. All of these three variables had positive correlation with serum TSH level (r value 0.241, 0.319 and 0.332 respectively). Level of correlation of serum TSH was statistically significant with unit of blood transfused (p=0.010) and with duration of transfusion therapy taken (p=0.007) but not with serum ferritin level (p=0.055). Meticulous transfusion history taking is more important than investigation reports like serum ferritin level to predict hypothyroidism in TDT patients."

The aim of the present study is to identify a rare HBB: c.316-90 A > G variant and provide the clinical and hematological features in two unrelated Chinese families. In this study, we collected eight subjects from two unrelated Chinese families. Conventional thalassemia gene testing was performed to investigate common α and β-thalassemia variants based on the PCR reverse dot hybridization technique. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) was utilized to examine the rare or novel HBA1, HBA2 and HBB gene variants, which will be further verified using Sanger sequencing. A rare HBB: c.316-90 A > G variant was identified in the proband of Family 1 using TGS, and exhibited remarkably low levels of hemoglobin (Hb), Hb A2, MCV and MCH. The other members in Family 1 did not have the HBB: c.316-90 A > G variant and elicited normal hematological screening results. In Family 2, the proband also carried the HBB: c.316-90 A > G variant and exhibited low levels of MCV, MCH and Hb A2, but with normal Hb value. However, pedigree analysis results revealed that the proband's mother and nephew also carried the HBB: c.316-90 A > G variant, but with normal hematological screening results.

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) could be a candidate for modulating SCA complications, such as priapism, as it has demonstrated an essential role in hematopoiesis, platelet aggregation, and immune responses. We evaluated the association of ECS-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (FAAH rs324420, MAGL rs604300, CNR1 rs7766029, and CNR2 rs35761398) with priapism in a Brazilian SCA cohort. The study involved 138 SCA patients (n = 80 with priapism and n = 58 without priapism). SCA was detected with HPLC, and the Hb SS genotype was confirmed with PCR-RE. Alpha thalassemia mutations were detected with Multiplex-PCR, and SNP genotyping was performed using TaqMan genotyping assays. We observed a lower frequency of -α<sup>3.7kb</sup>-thalassemia mutation in patients with priapism than in patients without this complication (p < 0.001), and in adjusted multivariate analyses TT-CC genotype of CNR2 rs35761398 was associated with a lower chance of developing priapism (OR = 0.386 [0.175-0.854], p = 0.019) and a lower risk of it over time (HR = 0.634 [0.402-0.987], p = 0.049). The SCA ischemic priapism is related to unbalanced vasodilation/vasoconstriction pathways, such as decreased RhoA/Rho-kinase (ROCK) signaling. Since activating the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2) decreases RhoA activation, we suggest a novel approach to SCA priapism involving CB2."

Here, a targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) is demonstrated to capture 20 genes/loci in 1,020 β-thalassemia patients. This panel permits not only identification of thalassemia mutations at 100% of sensitivity and specificity, but also detection of rare structural variants (SVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in modifier genes/loci. The highly homologous regions of α-/β-globin gene clusters are then phased and 3 novel haplotypes in HBG1/HBG2 region are reported in this population of β-thalassemia patients. Furthermore, one of the haplotypes is associated with ameliorated symptoms of β-thalassemia. Similarly, 5 major haplotypes are identified in HBA1/HBA2 homologous region while one of them is found highly linked with deletional α-thalassemia mutations. Finally, rare mutations in erythroid transcription factors in DNMT1 and KLF1 associated with increased expression of fetal hemoglobin and reduced transfusion dependencies are identified. This study presents the largest T-LRS study for β-thalassemia patients to date, facilitating precise clinical diagnosis and haplotype phasing of globin gene clusters."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia patients with elevated gamma globin (HBG1/G2) levels exhibit mild or no symptoms. To recapitulate this natural phenomenon, the most coveted gene therapy approach is to edit the regulatory sequences of HBG1/G2 to reactivate them. By editing more than one regulatory sequence in the HBG promoter, the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can be significantly increased. However, achieving this goal requires precise nucleotide conversions in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at therapeutic efficiency, which remains a challenge. We employed Cas9 RNP-ssODN-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) gene editing to mimic two naturally occurring HBG promoter point mutations; -175T > C, associated with high HbF levels, and -158 C > T, a common polymorphism in the Indian population that induces HbF under erythropoietic stress, in HSPCs. Asymmetric, nontarget ssODN induced high rates of complete HDR conversions, with at least 15% of HSPCs exhibiting both the -175T > C and -158 C > T mutations. Optimized conditions and treatment with the small molecule AZD-7648 increased this rate, with up to 57% of long-term engrafting human HSPCs in NBSGW mice containing at least one beneficial mutation. Functionally, in vivo erythroblasts exhibited high levels of HbF, which was sufficient to reverse the cellular phenotype of β-thalassemia. Further support through bone marrow MSC co-culture boosted complete HDR conversion rates to exceed 80%, with minimal InDels, improved cell viability, and induced fetal hemoglobin levels similar to those of Cas9 RNP-mediated indels at BCL11A enhancer and HBG promoter. Cas9 RNP-ssODN-based nucleotide conversion at the HBG promoter offers a promising gene therapy approach to ameliorate the phenotypes of β-thalassemia and SCD. The developed approach can simplify and broaden applications that require the cointroduction of multiple nucleotide modifications in HSPCs."

    "abstract": "The environmental persistence of pharmaceuticals represents a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health, while limitations in conventional wastewater treatment methods underscore the urgent need for innovative and eco-friendly degradation strategies. Photobiocatalytic approaches provide a promising solution for the effective degradation of pharmaceutical contaminants by harnessing the synergistic effects of both photocatalysts and biocatalysts. In this study, we developed a photobiocatalytic composite by co-immobilizing laccase enzyme and zinc oxide nanoparticles on bacterial cellulose synthesized from orange peel waste. The optimal conditions for achieving maximum yield and efficiency of immobilization were investigated and the successful preparation of the composite was confirmed using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The immobilized laccase showed K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> values of 0.68 ± 0.23 mM and 5.4 ± 0.86 μmol/min/L, respectively. The prepared composite was efficiently applied for degradation of favipiravir under optimum conditions including pH, temperature, and incubation time values of 4.0, 50 °C, and 90 min, respectively. The presence of ZnO nanoparticles in the structure of the photobiocatalyst significantly decreased the time of removal in comparison with both free and immobilized laccases. Although 80 ± 5.5 % of the enzyme activity was kept after 10 runs, the prepared photobiocatalyst retained 50 ± 4.6 % of its initial activity after 10 independent cycles. The study showed that the synergistic effects of laccase and ZnO nanoparticles possess the potentials to enhance degradation efficiency through combined light-driven and enzymatic approaches."

This study aims to determine bone and joint involvement in beta-thalassemic patients. It evaluates serum biochemical parameters of bone formation and resorption and correlates with the symptomatology in these patients. The study also determines their daily physical activity and find a correlation if any with bone mineral density. The study was carried out on 40 regularly transfused beta thalassemic patients between 5 and 18 years of age under regular follow-up at our centre from June 2012 to June 2014. All patients were interviewed as per a well-structured proforma for symptoms relating to bone and joint disease as described by the patient/parents in past 1 year and physical activity by QAPACE questionnaire. Venous blood samples were drawn under aseptic conditions and used for estimation of biochemical parameters (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and serum ferritin). Enrolled subjects were scanned for bone mineral density (BMD) at femur neck, trochanter and Ward's angle using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study (Male:Female = 80:20). Half the patients (<i>n</i> = 20) had symptoms pertaining to bone and joint disease. The most common symptom was leg pain (42.50%), followed by backache (22.50%). Asymptomatic patients had greater mean serum vitamin D as compared to the symptomatic patients (22.2 vs 15.08 ng/ml) (<i>p</i> = 0.225). Five patients were detected to have osteopenia, all above 10 years of age. The mean BMD in symptomatic patients at femur neck, trochanter and ward's angle was 0.781, 0.639 and 0.735 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, as compared to 0.754, 0.635 and 0.722 g/cm<sup>2</sup> in asymptomatic patients. The difference was not statistically significant. Patients with low BMD had lower mean pre-transfusion Hb (< 9 g/dl) (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Eighty percent of osteopenic patients had sedentary lifestyle as compared to 44% of patients with normal BMD. Bone mineral density did not have any correlation with vitamin D levels, serum ferritin and type of chelation therapy. Pre-transfusion hemoglobin of more than 9 gm/dL has a protective role in maintaining good bone health and bone mineral density. Engaging thalassemia patients in physical activity has a positive effect on bone mineral density. Low vitamin D levels contribute to symptoms of bone and joint involvement in thalassemia and the same needs to be determined and supplemented."

    "abstract": "δβ-thalassemia/HPFH is an uncommon hemoglobinopathy characterized by decreased or the total absence of production of δ- and β-globin and increased HbF levels. Both these disorders have variable genotype and phenotype, but significant overlap in the clinical and laboratory findings. Given the lack of literature in this regard, the study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the disease and evaluate its clinical, hematological, and molecular profile in India. This was a retrospective study where all samples with HbF level ≥ 5% and suspected to be δβ-thalassemia/HPFH, based on the HPLC, were included in the study over 3.5 years. The demographic and clinical details were retrieved from the electronic medical records. Gap-PCR was carried out to characterize the molecular defect for the HbF determinant, while amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR) was carried out for β-thalassemia genoyping. Clinical and laboratory parameters of heterozygous and homozygous/compound heterozygous δβ thalassemia deletions were compared. A total of 65 individuals (0.8%) were diagnosed with δβ-thalassemia/HPFH; these included 45 (69%) patients in the heterozygous group and 20 (31%) cases in the homozygous/compound heterozygous subgroup. While all the carrier states were asymptomatic, 80% of the patients in the homozygous/compound heterozygous state were symptomatic with a thalassemia intermedia-like profile. The median Hb levels were 12.3 g/dL (range -9.5-18.2) and 8.0 g/dL (range 3.8-15.1) respectively. Molecular profiling identified heterozygous Asian Indian inversion deletion <sup>G</sup>γ(<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup> mutation in 50% of cases, heterozygous HPFH-3 (Indian HPFH, 48.5 kb deletion) in 14% cases, and homozygous <sup>G</sup>γ(<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia in 21% cases. Compound heterozygous HPFH-3/<sup>G</sup>γ(<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup> mutation with β-thalassemia was observed in 8.9% and 3.5%, respectively. In one case, the HbF determinant could not be identified. Heterozygous (HBB:c. 92+5G>C), was the most frequent co-inherited β-thalassemia mutation in the compound heterozygous patients. The study highlights that high HbF determinants, like δβ thalassemia and HPFH, are relatively more frequent in the Indian subcontinent, and their co-inheritance with β-thalassemia results in a moderately severe disease. Accurate identification of molecular defects is important for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Inter-individual variability in drug responses is significantly influenced by genetic factors, underscoring the importance of population-specific pharmacogenomic studies to optimize clinical outcomes. In this study, we analyzed whole genome sequencing data from 949 unrelated Thai individuals and conducted an in-depth analysis of 3239 genes involved in drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or immune-mediated adverse drug reactions. We identified 43 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 134 diplotypes, and 15 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, all with moderate to high clinical significance. On average, each Thai individual carried 14 SNPs, one to two HLA alleles, and six diplotypes with actionable phenotypic associations. Clinically important diplotypes were present in over 20% of individuals for seven genes (CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, NAT2, SLCO1B1, and VKORC1). In addition, clinically significant SNPs with allele frequencies exceeding 20% were identified among 15 genes, including VKORC1, CYP4F2, and ABCG2. We also identified 21,211 potentially deleterious variants among 3239 genes. Of these variants, 3746 were novel. The comprehensive dataset from this study serves as a valuable resource of pharmacogenomic variants in the Thai population, which will facilitate the development of personalized drug therapies and enhance patient care in Thailand."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder worldwide, impacting millions and imposing severe healthcare challenges, particularly in resource-limited regions. Current treatments have variable efficacy and require lifelong adherence. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation can be curative but comes with significant side effects and limited donor availability limits its widespread applicability. Gene therapy, by addressing the root genetic causes, offers a revolutionary alternative. This article discusses the molecular mechanisms of SCD and β-thalassemia and highlights advancements in gene therapy, such as gene addition via lentiviral vectors and gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Clinical trials have brought about significant progress but challenges remain, including leukemogenesis, delivery efficiency and cost. Future efforts must focus on enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, developing nongenotoxic conditioning regimens and methods for in vivo application."

    "title": "Reproductive Health in Women with Major β-Thalassemia: Evaluating Ovarian Reserve and Endocrine Complications.",
    "abstract": "Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive hereditary chronic hemolytic anemia characterized by a partial or complete deficiency in the synthesis of alpha- or beta-globin chains, which are essential components of adult hemoglobin. Mutations in the globin genes lead to the production of unstable globin chains that precipitate within cells, causing hemolysis. This shortens the lifespan of mature red blood cells (RBCs) and results in the premature destruction of RBC precursors in the bone marrow. Regular red blood cell transfusions are the standard treatment for thalassemia. However, these transfusions can lead to increased iron overload, which can impair vital systems such as the liver, heart, ovaries, and endocrine system. Focusing on female reproductive endocrinology, recurrent blood transfusions can cause iron accumulation in the pituitary and hypothalamus, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), the most common endocrinopathy in these patients, affecting 40-91% of women. Recurrent transfusions and the resulting iron overload can also lead to oxidative stress and ovarian damage in patients with beta-thalassemia major (BTM). Despite advancements in iron chelation therapy, hypothalamic-pituitary damage associated with HH contributes to subfertility and sexual dysfunction, often with little to no recovery. In women exposed to gonadotoxic drugs, particularly those with BTM, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)-a marker of ovarian reserve-is frequently used to assess ovarian damage. This review aims to explore the pathophysiology of β-thalassemia and its major clinical manifestations, with a focus on endocrine complications and their impact on ovarian reserve. It also investigates how metabolomics can provide insights into the disease's metabolic alterations and inform current and emerging therapeutic strategies to mitigate complications and optimize patient outcomes, potentially leading to more effective and personalized treatments."

    "abstract": "<i>Clonorchiasis</i> remains a non-negligible global zoonosis, imposing serious socio-economic burdens in endemic regions. The interplay between gut microbiota and the host transcriptome is crucial for maintaining health; however, the impact of <i>Clonorchiasis sinensis</i> juvenile infection on these factors is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate their relationship and potential pathogenic mechanisms. The BALB/c mouse model of early infection with <i>C. sinensis</i> juvenile was constructed. Pathological analyses revealed that <i>C. sinensis</i> juvenile triggered liver inflammation, promoted intestinal villi growth, and augmented goblet cell numbers in the ileum. Additionally, the infection altered the diversity and structure of gut microbiota, particularly affecting beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, and disrupted the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Gut transcriptome analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as infection progressed. Enriched Gene Ontology items highlighted immune and detoxification-related processes, including immunoglobulin production and xenobiotic metabolic processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis further indicated involvement in circadian rhythm, as well as various detoxification and metabolic-related pathways (e.g., glutathione metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis). Prominent DEGs associated with these pathways included Igkv12-41, Mcpt2, Arntl, Npas2, Cry1, and Gsta1. Correlation analysis additionally identified <i>Bacteroides_sartorii</i> as a potential key regulator in the interaction between gut microbiota and transcriptome. This study sheds light on the alterations in gut microbiota and transcriptome in mice following <i>C. sinensis</i> juvenile infection, as well as their correlation, laying a foundation for a better understanding of their interaction during infection. This study highlighted the impact of <i>C. sinensis</i> juvenile infection on the gut microbiota and transcriptome of BALB/c mice. It induced liver inflammation, promoted intestinal villi growth, and altered goblet cell numbers. The infection also disrupted the diversity and structure of gut microbiota, particularly affecting beneficial bacteria. Transcriptome analysis revealed increased expression of genes related to immune response and detoxification processes. Important pathways affected included circadian rhythm, glutathione metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Notable genes implicated included Igkv12-41, Mcpt2, Arntl, Npas2, Cry1, and Gsta1. <i>Bacteroides_sartorii</i> emerged as a potential key regulator in this interaction."

    "title": "A Retrospective Analysis of Demographics, Clinical Features, and Treatment Patterns in Sickle Cell Disease Patients at a Tertiary Healthcare Centre of North East India.",
    "abstract": "Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder marked by abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), leading to chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), and multi-organ complications. In India, the prevalence of SCD is highest among tribal populations in states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Assam, with the disease burden exacerbated by limited healthcare access, especially in rural regions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the demographic profile, clinical features, and treatment patterns of SCD patients at a tertiary healthcare center in Upper Assam, where the prevalence of SCD is high among the tea tribe communities. Methods This retrospective observational study included 250 patients diagnosed with various SCD subtypes who presented with SCD-related complications at Assam Medical College and Hospital between January 2020 and December 2023. Data were obtained from medical records in the departments of medicine and pediatrics, covering demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity), clinical characteristics (complications, hemoglobin levels, genotype, history of hospitalizations), and treatment details (frequency and type of blood transfusions, use of hydroxyurea and chelating agents). Descriptive statistics summarized demographic and clinical features, while chi-square tests and t-tests were used for bivariate analysis. Logistic regression identified factors associated with high transfusion requirements. Results The study population had a mean age of 17.2 years, with 54.4% male predominance. Most patients (87%) had sickle cell anemia (HbSS), while the remainder had other genotypes including HbSA, HbSE, and sickle cell thalassemia. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (61.2%) and bone/joint pain (48.4%), indicative of VOCs and frequent infections. Pallor (30%) and abdominal pain (25.6%) were also prominent. Half of the patients (125) received hydroxyurea, though its uptake was limited by availability and cost. A high transfusion burden was noted, with 72.4% of patients requiring between five to 12 transfusions annually. However, only 22.4% received chelation therapy to manage iron overload, reflecting the cost constraints in accessing these agents. Laboratory findings indicated a mean hemoglobin level of 7.19 g/dL and elevated serum ferritin levels due to repeated transfusions. The frequency of blood transfusions was higher compared to Western studies, emphasizing the need for more accessible disease-modifying therapies in resource-limited settings. Conclusions The findings of this study illustrate the significant clinical and transfusion burden experienced by SCD patients in Upper Assam. This population relies heavily on blood transfusions due to limited access to hydroxyurea and other advanced therapies. The study underscores a critical need for improved access to hydroxyurea, expanded availability of chelation therapy, and greater healthcare support for managing SCD-related complications in resource-limited settings. As India's National Sickle Cell Anemia Elimination Mission is implemented, regional studies such as this are essential for tailoring public health interventions to meet the specific needs of high-prevalence areas, especially among underserved tribal communities."

    "abstract": "To investigate the clinical characteristics of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in children with thalassemia major (TM) after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) and their prognosis. A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 280 children with TM who underwent haplo-HSCT in the Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, from January 2019 to December 2021. According to the CRS criteria, they were divided into two groups: CRS grade <3 (260 children) and CRS grade ≥3 (20 children). The children with TM were analyzed in terms of clinical characteristics of CRS after haplo-HSCT and their prognosis. There were significant differences between the two groups in neutrophil engraftment time, clinical manifestations of CRS, and the rate of use of glucocorticoids within 4 days after haplo-HSCT (<i>P</i>=0.012, 0.040, and <0.001 respectively). For the CRS grade <3 group, the incidence rate of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 9.6% within 3 months after transplantation, while no aGVHD was observed in the CRS grade ≥3 group within 3 months after transplantation, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of aGVHD between the two groups within 3 months after transplantation (<i>P</i>=0.146). No transplantation-related death was observed in either group within 3 months after haplo-HSCT. The children with CRS grade≥3 have an early neutrophil engraftment time, severe and diverse clinical manifestations of CRS, and a high rate of use of glucocorticoids within 4 days after haplo-HSCT. For these children, early use of low-dose glucocorticoids after transplantation may alleviate CRS response and reduce the incidence of aGVHD, thereby bringing more benefits to the children. CRS after haplo-HSCT has no significant impact on the prognosis of the children."

This cross-sectional study was designed to analyze the prevalence of dental caries, oral health status, malocclusion status, and dental treatment needs in thalassemic children. Institutional Ethical committee clearance was obtained before starting the study. The study sample comprised 100 thalassemic and 100 normal children in which oral disease markers like dmft/DMFT index, plaque index, gingival index, and Angle's classification for malocclusion were used. The statistical tool used was 'one-way ANOVA' with the probability set at 0.05. Statistically significant differences in prevalence of dental caries, periodontal disease, malocclusion, and treatment needs were noted in thalassemic individuals when compared to normal subjects. The present study has given an insight into the various oral and dentomaxillofacial manifestations of thalassemia, thus considering the importance of routine oral examination for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases."

    "title": "Early Engraftment and Immune Kinetics Following Allogeneic Transplant Using a Novel Reduced-Toxicity Transplant Strategy in Children/Adolescents with High-Risk Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia: Early Results of the ThalFAbS Trial.",
    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is challenging for patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia who have experienced iron overload and received chronic transfusion support. A transplantation strategy including a reduced-intensity preparative regimen and tailored immunosuppression to support donor engraftment and prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was developed for this population. The combination of a pretransplantation immunosuppression phase with reduced dosing of fludarabine/prednisone, a treosulfan-based preparative regimen with reduced cyclophosphamide dosing, and introduction of a calcineurin/methotrexate-free GVHD prophylaxis/engraftment supporting regimen with abatacept/sirolimus/antithymocyte globulin was tested. In the ThalFAbS trial, a prospective pilot trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05426252) of a transplantation strategy designed for higher-risk patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 12 pediatric patients (4 with alpha thalassemia, 8 with beta thalassemia) were treated with this strategy. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize transplantation outcomes and immune recovery. With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 4 to 26 months) post-transplantation, all 12 patients had prompt and durable trilineage donor engraftment with low transplantation-related morbidity and acute GVHD and are alive without transfusion support at the time of this report. GVHD was limited to 1 patient with skin-only grade II acute GVHD and 3 patients with limited oral chronic GVHD. Early hematologic and immunologic recovery was achieved, with low rates of transfusion support and infection. Neutrophil recovery occurred at a median of 18 days (range, 15 to 24 days), and platelet recovery occurred at a median of 18 days (range, 12 to 36 days). No patients experienced veno-occlusive disease, transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or sepsis. This platform was sufficient to support haploidentical donor transplantation in 2 patients. The ThalFAbS approach is tailored to meet the unique needs of transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. Delivery of this novel regimen is feasible, and it shows excellent early engraftment and transplantation outcomes. Further follow-up of this cohort and expansion of patient numbers is needed before the findings can be generalized, but early experience is promising."

    "abstract": "Voriconazole (VRC) is recommended for the prevention and treatment of invasive fungal infections in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics (PK) and exhibits substantial inter- and intraindividual variability. Phenytoin sodium (PHT) and methylprednisolone (MP) are commonly used in the early stages of HSCT to prevent epilepsy and graft-versus-host disease. Drug-drug interactions between VRC and these medications represent a significant concern in HSCT recipients. This study aims to investigate the effects of coadministration with PHT, MP, and other covariates on VRC metabolism in children with thalassemia (TM) undergoing allogeneic HSCT (Allo-HSCT) using population pharmacokinetics (PPK) and to recommend the optimal dosage regimen for this unique group. A total of 237 samples from 57 children with TM undergoing Allo-HSCT were collected. Non-linear mixed effects modeling and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) were applied for PPK analysis and for optimizing VRC dosing, respectively. The VRC data were characterized by a two-compartment model with linear elimination and first-order absorption. All parameters were incorporated in allometric scaling form, with PHT and MP significantly influencing VRC clearance. The MCS revealed a negative correlation between the children's body weight (ranging from 10 to 40 kg) and the required dose. When PHT was co-administered, approximately three times the regular dose of VRC was required. In contrast, when MP was administered together, the dose needed to be increased by 12.5-50%. The proposed regimen improved the probability of target attainment for VRC and may serve as a reference for the individualized administration of VRC in clinical practice."

A 78 years-old Spanish male patient visited the Internal Medicine Clinic for a routine check-up, with HbA<sub>1c</sub> included to screen for diabetes. He had suffered hypertension and dyslipidemia, and the patient had no previous symptoms suggestive of diabetes such as hyperglycemia, weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria or tiredness. Diabetes screening by HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurement was assessed using cation exchange HPLC and an immunoassay point-of-care analyzer. Routine hemoglobinopathy screening was performed including CBC, HbF and HbA<sub>2</sub> measurement by cation exchange HPLC and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Further variant characterization was undertaken by DNA sequencing. Discordant HbA<sub>1c</sub> results were obtained for our subject, with elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 52 mmol/mol measured by cation exchange HPLC and a normal level of 34 mmol/mol by immunoassay. Abnormal HbA<sub>1c</sub> peak shape prompted hemoglobinopathy screening to investigate potential variant interference. A globin gene analysis was performed, and the results showed a variant hemoglobin named 'Hb Petie Salpetriere'. This variant arises from a Val → Phe substitution due to a mutation of c.103G>T of the beta-globin gene [BETA34 (B16) Val>Phe; HBB:c.103G>T]. This is the first reported case involving the Hb Petie Salpetriere variant in a Spanish patient. The present results show that the Hb Petie Salpetriere variant can affect the results of HbA<sub>1c</sub> analysis through ion-exchange HPLC, but not that obtained from the latex agglutination immunoassay. Only ion-exchange HPLC suggested the presence of the Hb variant in this case, suggesting that a careful review of the resulting chromatogram might reveal a potential variant."

    "abstract": "Background Beta-thalassemia major is a genetic blood disease complicated by splenomegaly, and splenectomy is a standard therapy for this medical condition. Although splenectomy results not only in the improvement of the hematological status, the long-term consequences to the cardiovascular system are still questionable. Objective The aim of the study was to assess and compare the cardiovascular impact of splenomegaly and splenectomy in patients with beta-thalassemia major. Methodology This is a cross-sectional survey conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, from January 2024 to June 2024. A total of 88 beta-thalassemia major patients were divided into two groups: 44 patients with splenomegaly were recruited and compared with 44 post-splenectomy patients. Outcomes that were assessed in this study from the medical records were cardiac function test, ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy, thromboembolic incidences, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, blood pressure level, and the biochemical markers, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA). Results Patients with splenectomy exhibited slightly lower hemoglobin levels and higher transfusion requirements but had better ejection fractions compared to those with splenomegaly. In contrast, the splenomegaly group demonstrated worse cardiovascular outcomes, including higher rates of left ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, and elevated BNP levels, indicating increased cardiovascular morbidity and hemodynamic strain. Logistic regression analysis further suggested that splenectomy reduces the risk of cardiomyopathy, particularly in younger patients, while the splenomegaly group experiences a greater burden of acute cardiovascular complications. Conclusion Splenectomy in beta-thalassemia major patients offers improved cardiac function and hemoglobin levels while reducing transfusion needs, but it does not eliminate the risks of long-term cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, patients with splenomegaly face more severe and immediate cardiovascular risks, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. These findings underscore the importance of tailored management strategies to optimize outcomes for both groups."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the principal causes of mortality in the world. Various factors have been identified in the pathogenesis of CVD. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) as a secretory cytokine is one of these factors. The LIF receptor is located on endothelial cells and plays a role in the expression of specific genes in these cells. Endothelial cells are the innermost cells of blood vessels, and defects in these cells cause endothelial dysfunction and eventually CVD. The present study is based on PubMed database information (1982-2022) using the following words: \"cardiovascular disease,\" \"endothelial cells,\" \"leukemia inhibitory factor,\" and \"angiogenesis.\" LIF can cause arteriosclerotic plaques by activating inflammatory mechanisms in monocytes through the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. LIF can also induce vascular endothelial growth factor expression by activating signaling pathways, eventually leading to angiogenesis. Additionally, it can activate the coagulation cascade by factor VII production promotion within endothelial cells. Understanding the interplay between LIF and the inflammation pathways, coagulation, and angiogenesis as key factors in CVD occurrence raises the possibility of targeting this factor as a potential strategy to mitigate CVD risk."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is not currently conceived per se as a disability, but it can be a disability-inducing condition if poorly treated or as complications increase with age. People living with thalassemia do not wish, on the one hand, to be considered disabled persons to avoid stigma and loss of opportunities to achieve social inclusion in all paths of life while, on the other, they are in need of lifelong appropriate, disease-specific health and social care, including disability allowances and schemes, in order to be able to smoothly integrate into society and achieve professional, educational, personal, and social goals. The ongoing debate on whether thalassemia is a disability or not is thus complex and inconclusive and has created a vast heterogeneity of policies and approaches across the globe. Given that the risk to develop disabilities is subject to individualised assessment, the thalassemia International Federation (TIF) proposes a specific disability risk assessment model for thalassaemia (DRAM-Thal), based on the findings of a targeted literature review and of the TIF survey 2022-2023. This model considers both clinical features and social parameters and is addressed to national healthcare and social services and all other relevant stakeholders. At the same time, this work prompts further research on this understudied topic that heavily affects the rights and daily life of people living with the disease."

The high incidence of transplant-related complications is becoming an obstacle to safe and effective unrelated donor (URD) transplantation. In this retrospective study, we reported the survival outcomes and complications of transplantation in thalassemia patients using a novel regimen consisting of pre-transplantation immunosuppression (PTIS) and modified myeloablative conditioning based on intravenous busulfan, cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rabbit anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin. A total of 88 thalassemia patients received the novel conditioning regimen (NCR group), while 118 patients received the conventional conditioning regimen (CCR group). The median age at HSCT in the NCR group was older (7 years vs. 4 years, p < 0.05). No patient in the NCR group experienced primary graft failure, while the 3-year probabilities of OS and TFS were 96.6% and 93.2%, respectively. Even when the intensity of conditioning was reduced, OS (94.8% vs. 94.3%, p = 0.848) and TFS (89.8% vs. 92.5%, p = 0.663) in URD transplants in the NCR group were comparable to those in the CCR group, while the risk of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (0% vs. 15.1%) was lower. In addition, the NCR group had lower rates of mixed chimerism (7.1%). URD transplantation can achieve a comparable prognosis to matched sibling donor (MSD) transplantation with a lower incidence of AIHA due to PTIS and modified myeloablative conditioning regimen."

    "title": "Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant in Hematological Disorders: A Decade of Experience.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a complex procedure with the potential to provide curative treatment for various hematological disorders. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of allo-HCT in hematological diseases and identify significant complications in a single-center setting. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 180 patients with hematological diseases who underwent allo-HCT between January 2011 and December 2021. Key outcomes, including indications for transplantation, overall survival, engraftment time, relapse rates, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplant-related mortality (TRM) were assessed. <b>Results</b>: The most common indications for allo-HCT were benign hematological diseases, particularly aplastic anemia, and thalassemia major. Despite the majority of patients receiving fully matched transplants, acute GVHD was observed in 30% of the cohort. Graft failure occurred in 13 patients, with primary and secondary graft failure rates of 1.6% and 5.5%, respectively. Sepsis emerged as the primary cause of non-relapsed mortality at day 100 and beyond. The overall survival rate in this study was 62%, with 79% of patients disease-free on their last visit. <b>Conclusion</b>: This study provides valuable insights into the treatment strategies and patient care of allo-HCT for hematological disorders by offering a comprehensive overview of multiple relevant outcomes. The findings underscore the significance of addressing complications and risk factors associated with allogeneic transplantation, including GVHD and infections. Future research should focus on further optimizing transplantation techniques to minimize complications and enhance patient survival."

    "title": "Hematologic Parameters Cut-off Assessment of Adult Alpha-Thalassemia Patients in Iran.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Thalassemia is one of the most common blood disorders in Iran. Alpha-thalassemia is caused by the deletion of the alpha-globin gene. The frequency of deletions in the alpha-globin gene is associated with microcytosis and hypochromia, making hematological parameters valuable predictive tools in the initial identification of alpha-thalassemia patients. This study aimed to compare hematologic parameters such as Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), red blood cell (RBC) count, and hemoglobin (HGB) levels in silent and minor patients, whose genotypes were genetically characterized, with normal patients to establish cut-off points for these groups. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> The study involved a total of 860 patients with alpha-thalassemia, including 267 cases of silent, 261 cases of minor, and 332 cases of normal alpha-thalassemia. <b>Results:</b> Analysis of blood indices based on sex revealed that the male group had higher values than the female group. Assessment of alpha-thalassemia in minor patients showed that the Cis form (-/αα) had higher microcytosis than the Trans form (-α/-α) in this group. This difference was also observed between α<sup>-3.7</sup>α/ α<sup>-3.7</sup>α and (αα)<sup>-MED</sup>/αα as two different genetic forms in minor patients, with (αα)<sup>-MED</sup>/αα being in the Cis form. Data indicated that the cut-off value was insignificant in silent patients compared to the normal group. However, minor patients with MCH≤23.7 and MCV≤74.9 had an AUC greater than 0.9 (p-value< 0.01), distinguishing them from the normal group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Comparing hematological parameters in these groups illustrated that MCV and MCH are the best predictor parameters for distinguishing between groups."

    "abstract": "Bacterial infections leading to bacteremia and septicemic shock constitute an emerging public health concern globally, especially in areas where sanitation is poor and safe drinking water is scarce. Enteric pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae are responsible for many deaths caused by contaminated food and water in these areas. While cholera is the prominent clinical threat posed by V. cholerae, outcomes like bacteremia turning into sepsis and associated morbidity and mortality have been increasing globally in recent times. Here, we report an alarming case of fatal sepsis with a probable association of V. cholerae bacteremia in Bangladesh. In September 2023, a 30-year-old man with a pre-condition of beta-thalassemia presented to a tertiary care hospital with acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and fever and died within 36 h of admission with acute cholecystitis, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, pancytopenia, and refractory septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Blood culture detected V. cholerae, which was further characterized as hemolytic, carrying the hemolysin gene and genes for the virulence factor type-three secretion system. The isolate was confirmed as V. cholerae non-O1/O139 (NOVC), which differed in genetic properties from the few contemporary NOVC isolates associated with diarrheal cases in Bangladesh. To manage the diarrhea and septicemic condition, the patient was treated empirically with metronidazole and meropenem. However, antibiotic susceptibility testing showed the strain was susceptible to all the routinely prescribed drugs for V. cholerae infections. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation provides the first molecular description of a fatal case of V. cholerae-associated bacteremia in Bangladesh and underscores the need for comprehensive investigations on bacterial septicemia to prevent future casualties."

    "abstract": "Unstable hemoglobins are caused by single amino acid substitutions in the HBB gene, often affecting key histidine residues, leading to protein destabilization and hemolytic crises. In contrast, long HBB variants, exceeding 20 bp, are rare and associated with a β-thalassemia phenotype due to disrupted α-β chain interactions. We describe a family wherein four of six members carry a novel 23-amino-acid in-frame duplication of HBB (c.176_244dup), named hemoglobin (Hb) Monza. Despite its length, this duplication manifests as an unstable hemoglobin variant rather than a β-thalassemia phenotype. A static 3D model of the Hb Monza β chain was generated using AlphaFold and SWISS-MODEL. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with the Generalized Born implicit solvent model. After energy minimization and heating to 311 K (38°C), a 40 ns production run was conducted. 3D modeling of Hb Monza revealed minimal structural changes in the Hb β chain, particularly in the key histidine residues and their interaction with the iron atom. Additionally, the static 3D model showed a preserved α-β interaction, explaining the absence of a β-thalassemia clinical phenotype. MD simulations under thermal stress revealed a notable increase in root-mean-square deviation compared to the wild-type β subunit, along with a loss of contacts with the heme, explaining the hemolytic crises during febrile episodes. Despite the long duplication in HBB, Hb Monza retains functional α-β interaction while demonstrating instability under stressful conditions. This unique variant presents with an unstable Hb phenotype rather than a β-thalassemia phenotype. No financial funding was received."

Astrocytomas classically show <i>ATRX</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations, whereas oligodendrogliomas are defined by 1p/19q co-deletion. However, there are reports of gliomas that harbor both astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma morphologically and molecularly. Here we present a patient of a 29-year-old woman who presented with a headache and underwent gross total excision. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right frontal space-occupying lesion with T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch. Histology showed 2 distinct areas of morphology compatible with oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma. Immunohistochemistry showed both components being positive for IDH R132H. Alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) showed loss of nuclear expression and p53 was strongly positive in the morphologic astrocytoma component, whereas ATRX was retained and p53 was negative in the morphologic oligodendroglioma component. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed 1p/19q co-deletion in the oligodendroglioma component while co-deletion was absent in the astrocytoma component. <i>TERT</i> mutation was present in the oligodendroglioma component, whereas it was absent in the astrocytoma component. Although rare, gliomas harboring both oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma components in a single tumor exist and show genetically distinct areas."

The presentation ranges from asymptomatic heterozygosity to significant anemia in patients carrying an additional pathogenic variant in β-globin. To elucidate the clinical spectrum of Hb-COH, we analyzed 31 individuals carrying the variant, including, for the first time, homozygous individuals. Seven patients who were compound heterozygous for Hb-COH and an additional variant in β-globin, presented with mild-to-severe microcytic anemia and elevated hemoglobin-A2. Three (43%) of these also had elevated fetal hemoglobin, but none required blood transfusions. Seven patients coinherited Hb-COH with an -α<sup>3.7</sup>-deletion (NG_000006.1:g.34247_38050del), their presentation ranged from mild microcytic anemia to normal blood counts. Three homozygous and 14 heterozygous individuals for Hb-COH had normal blood counts. Most Hb-COH alleles whose origin was traceable were from Ashkenazi Jews (70.4%). To conclude, while isolated Hb-COH appears asymptomatic even in the homozygous state, it may cause significant anemia when coinherited with an additional pathogenic variant in β-globin. Understanding the full impact of Hb-COH is crucial for optimal patient management and for genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder and a common form of Hemoglobinopathy. It is classified into α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia. This disease is mainly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, including southern China. Severe α-thalassemia and intermediate α-thalassemia are among the most common birth defects in southern China. Intermediate α-thalassemia, also known as Hb H disease, is characterized by moderate anemia. Severe α-thalassemia, also known as Hb Bart's Hydrops fetalis syndrome, is a fatal condition. Infants with severe β-thalassemia do not show symptoms at birth but develop severe anemia later, requiring expensive treatment. Most untreated patients with severe β-thalassemia die in early childhood. Screening for thalassemia carriers and genetic diagnosis in high-prevalence areas significantly reduce the incidence of severe thalassemia. This review aims to summarize the genetic diagnostic approaches for thalassemia. Conventional genetic testing methods can identify 95-98% of thalassemia carriers but may miss rare thalassemia genotypes. Third-Generation Sequencing offers significant advantages in complementing other genetic diagnostic approaches, providing a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Consanguineous marriage is a major contributing factor for many genetic diseases and a burden to the healthcare system and national economy due to costly long-term care. Earlier studies highlighted the significantly limited awareness of the higher prevalence of genetic disease due to consanguinity even among the educated Arabs. In Saudi Arabia, more than 50% of marriages are between first cousins. This national study aims to gauge the level of the public awareness regarding the consanguinity and its impact on prevalence of genetic diseases across the Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional bilingual online survey was conducted across Saudi Arabia, distributed through a variety of social media platforms for all residents. Pooled summary data was used from the participants. Majority of the 9191 participants are < 30 years of age (72.85%), single (61.35%), women (74.12%) and college educated (77.16%). Consanguineous marriages are common in the extended family of 61.24% of participants. Though majority of them (85.45%) recognise the higher genetic disease risk associated with consanguinity, low awareness among men was observed (76.61 vs 88.53%). Sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia were not considered as genetic diseases by 60.68% of males and 48.39% of females, though they are the most common genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia. More women are aware of the carrier screening tests than men (42.62 vs 34.56%). Only 6.87% know the rationale behind the national mandatory premarital screening tests and the diseases screened. Although almost all (99.18%) are active users of the social media, 47.77% of men and 57.17% of women use them to search for health-related information. The present study, one of the largest national surveys in highly consanguineous society, highlights that even the young and college-educated participants have low awareness of the genetic disease burden, which is strikingly high in all corners of the country. Social media platforms can be used by genetic professionals and national organizations to disseminate the reliable educational material to the public to reduce the national healthcare and economic burden in the future."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia, an inherited hemoglobin synthesis disorder, imposes a significant health burden in Asian regions with high prevalence. Detailed patterns and trends of the disease across countries and territories within these regions remain underexplored. Our study focuses on the disease burden indices of thalassemia within the four GBD-defined Asian regions and the twenty-five included countries and territories. It provides insights into the gender-age distribution, temporal changes, and economic aspects of the thalassemia burden. Data on thalassemia prevalence, incidence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study for South, East, Southeast, and high-income Asia regions, encompassing the relevant countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) in age-standardized rates of thalassemia was determined to assess temporal trends. Age-gender cohort proportions were considered. The economic aspect of the disease burden and frontier analysis were evaluated using the GBD Socio-Demographic Index and Global Health Expenditure data. Southeast Asia exhibited notably high age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), and age-standardized DALYs rate among the four studied Asian regions in 2021. The East Asia region had recorded the highest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR). A general decline in disease burden indices across the four regions from 1990 to 2021 was evident, with the exception of ASIR in Southeast Asia. The ASMR was highest among pediatric population under five years old, with a significant male preponderance. An unusual increase in ASMR was detected among females of childbearing age and the elderly within the studied region. Further analysis had identified six high-burden countries and territories, particularly those with low-middle Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) rankings and limited health expenditure. Although the overall burden of thalassemia has decreased substantially, the disease burden was influenced by gender, age, geography, temporal trends, and economic factors in distinct manners. Based on the current SDI, many countries and regions still have greater improvement potential in the disease burden. There is a necessity for enhanced attention and resource allocation, particularly in low-middle and low SDI countries, with an emphasis on policies that promote early diagnosis and comprehensive care."

    "abstract": "In southern China, α-thalassemia is the most prevalent hereditary monogenic disorder, and deletion variants are the predominant form. Conventional thalassemia diagnosis techniques are numerous, however they are all limited in their ability to detect rare deletions. Here, we discuss a family who sought genetic counseling during their fourth pregnancy after experiencing Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis in two of their previous pregnancies. To ascertain the thalassemia genotype, the family members underwent hematological testing, routine genetic analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The precise deletion locations could not be identified, while MLPA detected an unknown copy number variant. Lastly, a rare 11.1 kb deletion located in the <i>HBA</i> gene (Chr16: 170,832-182,004, GRch38/hg38) was directly identified by single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) sequencing. Furthermore, we confirmed the compound heterozygosity of --<sup>11.1</sup> allele and --<sup>SEA</sup> allele, which contributed to the explanation of the Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome in the fetuses from the second and third pregnancies. We have first verified a compound heterozygosity for --<sup>11.1</sup> allele and --<sup>SEA</sup> allele. This study may provide a reference strategy for the discovery of rare and potentially novel thalassemia variants using a comprehensive method combining SMRT sequencing and conventional diagnostic technology, improving the accuracy and efficacy of thalassemia diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Accumulation of free α-globin is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of β-thalassemia. Autophagy plays a crucial role in clearing toxic free α-globin, thereby reducing disease severity. However, the impact of natural mutations in autophagy-related genes (ATGs) on the phenotypic variability of β-thalassemia remains unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between variants in ATGs and disease phenotypes in a cohort of 1022 patients with β-thalassemia, identifying 4 missense mutations in the autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) gene. Disruption of the Ambra1 gene in β-thalassemic mice was found to reduce autophagic clearance of α-globin in red blood cell precursors, exacerbating disease phenotypes. Functional characterization of the AMBRA1 gene and these mutations in patient-derived CD34+ cells, edited human umbilical cord blood-derived erythroid progenitor 2 (HUDEP-2) cells, and engineered HUDEP-2 β-thalassemic cells confirmed that AMBRA1 facilitates the autophagic clearance of free α-globin in human erythroid cells. Functional studies demonstrated that AMBRA1 missense mutants destabilize Unc-51-like kinase 1 protein, inhibit light chain 3 protein lipidation, and subsequently hinder autophagic flux, leading to increased α-globin deposition. Additionally, these mutations were associated with erythrotoxic effects in vitro, including increased intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, higher apoptosis rates, and impaired erythroid differentiation and maturation. This study sheds light on the molecular association between mutations in ATGs and the exacerbation of β-thalassemia, highlighting the potential role of the AMBRA1 gene as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for β-hemoglobinopathies."

Patient characteristics and treatment patterns in these patients may vary. This retrospective study evaluated demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in patients with transfusion-dependent BT (TDT) and non-transfusion-dependent BT (NTDT). Medical records of adults with TDT or NTDT in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, and Canada with ⩾5 years of history within the practice were evaluated. Among patients with TDT (<i>N</i> = 118), mean (standard deviation (SD)) age was 36.1 (11.9) years, and 28.8% were female; among patients with NTDT (<i>N</i> = 96), mean (SD) age was 36.6 (9.8) years, and 38.5% were female. Among patients with TDT, 21.2% received transfusions every 2 weeks or more frequently, 28.8% every 3 weeks, 26.3% every 4 weeks, and 21.2% less frequently than 4 weeks. Patients with TDT had a mean (SD) of 2.4 (0.6) units of blood transfused per transfusion, with a pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hb) level of 6.9 (1.3). In total, 84.4% of patients with NTDT had at least one transfusion, and the mean (SD) number of transfusions among patients with NTDT was 15.9 (15.9). Among patients with NTDT, the mean (SD) units of blood per transfusion were 2.2 (0.6) units, and the mean (SD) Hb level prior to transfusion was 7.4 (1.2) g/dL. Iron chelation therapy was received by 70.3% of TDT patients and 45.8% of NTDT patients. This study found that both patients with NTDT and TDT have low pretransfusion Hb levels. A high number of patients, especially patients with TDT, were not treated according to the current recommendations on target hemoglobin level, thereby highlighting the importance of national reference centers for improving long-term outcomes and quality of life in these patients."

Because of its rarity and overlapping symptoms, this condition is often misdiagnosed as another pregnancy complication. A 28-year-old pregnant Japanese woman presented with sudden 7.5-kg weight gain, leg edema, and increased d-dimer level. Ultrasound revealed polyhydramnios and fetal hydrops, and findings of maternal edema and blood test results were suggestive of Miller syndrome. Although, the patient was initially misdiagnosed due to a lack of information and the rarity of this disease. An emergency cesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia at 36 weeks and 2 days of- pregnancy. We could not diagnose mirror syndrome. The newborn's Apgar scores were 2 and 5 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery, respectively. The patient's SpO2 suddenly decreased to 86% during cesarean section and persisted for 2 days. Chest computed tomography revealed pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. The pleural effusions and lung edema spontaneously resolved after the cesarean section. This case reports on Miller syndrome with maternal hypoxemia onset during an emergency cesarean section and highlights the potential for better perioperative management and improvement in maternal mortality through prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment shared not only among obstetricians and pediatricians but also among anesthesiologists."

    "abstract": "Patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) with iron overload have been linked to hypercoagulability and increased platelet (PLT) activation that causes thrombosis. Green tea extract (GTE) rich in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) exerts iron-chelating and antithrombotic properties. The study aimed to assess the effects of GTE treatment on plasma coagulation state and PLT function in vitro and in patients with TDT. The subjects consumed a placebo or GTE tablets (50 mg and 2 × 50 mg EGCG equivalent) every day for two months. Blood was then collected from the treated patients for analyses of PLT numbers, agonist-induced PLT aggregation, and anti-coagulation proteins. In our findings indicate that the in vitro treatment of GTE (at least 1 mg EGCG equivalent) inhibited PLT aggregation in patients who were healthy and with thalassemia platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which was significant in the healthy PRP. Consistently, GTE treatment inhibited the PLT aggregation that had been ex vivo generated by collagen or ADP. In addition, consumption of GTE tablets greatly inhibited PLT aggregation and increased the plasma levels of proteins C and S, as well as the free protein S concentrations depending upon the time course, but not the GTE dosage. Moreover, plasma ferritin levels decreased in both green tea tablet groups in a time-dependent manner (<i>p</i> < 0.05 in the second month). In conclusion, EGCG-rich GTE diminished PLT aggregation in patients who were healthy and patients with thalassemia plasma. It also improved PLT aggregation and hypercoagulability in patients with TDT by increasing the antithrombotic activity of protein C and protein S. This would suggest an adjuvant of GTE could reduce the risk of thrombosis associated with iron overload."

Hereditary hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemias are characterized by a hepcidin deficiency, making hepcidin a novel therapeutic target for preventing and managing iron overload. Modulators of hepcidin expression and molecules mimicking hepcidin are emerging as highly promising therapeutic strategies. We present a summary of results from preclinical and clinical trials of such therapies in models of iron overload. Current treatment alternatives in iron overload fail to address the underlying hepcidin deficiency - and may even exacerbate it. Until hepcidin-targeting therapies become available, several challenges remain, including the need to optimize dosing in order to manage the narrow treatment window and improving specificity in targeting iron metabolism pathways exclusively. Long-term studies are crucial to fully assess both the benefits and risks of these therapies and to explore their potential utility in combination with existing treatment guidelines. Furthermore, these therapies are expected to have applications, particularly in addressing other iron-maldistributed disorders, as seen in anemia of chronic disease and inflammation."

A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 100 transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major patients on oral iron chelating agent-deferasirox. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) was carried out in all patients to assess the auditory side effects of the drug. Data was collected, compiled, and analyzed statistically using appropriate statistical tests. The relationship between ototoxicity and various demographic parameters such as age, sex, hemoglobin (Hb) level, S. ferritin, duration, and dose of chelation therapy was also assessed. Sixteen patients had abnormal DPOAE and the number of patients with pure tone average above 25 dB HL which was taken as hearing deficit on PTA was 13. No statistically significant relationship between hearing loss and age, gender, S. ferritin, duration of therapy, cumulative dose, Hb levels were found. Despite being a lifesaving drug, the advantages of chelating agent-Deferasirox must be weighed against its probable ototoxic effects. We could not find a relationship of ototoxicity with variable parameters (age, gender, Hb level, Ferritin level, duration, and cumulative dose of drug), thus future research is encouraged to form a definitive basis."

A total of 62 children with β-thalassemia were recruited and categorized by genotype, along with 17 healthy pediatric volunteers for analysis. The circulating ferritin content was evaluated, and plasma levels of TF, C1S, IGHG4, HBA1, and CLU were assessed using ELISA. The primary outcome of this study was the correlation between the five protein marker levels and iron overload. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. A binary logistic regression model identified independent predictors of iron overload in patients with β-thalassemia. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were employed to evaluate the model's performance. The IGHG4 protein content was significantly lower in β-thalassemia patients compared to healthy controls. The IGHG4 protein content was reduced in the β<sup>+</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> and β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> patient populations compared to controls, with no significant difference observed between the β<sup>+</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> group and healthy controls. A strong inverse relationship was identified between the IGHG4 protein content and SF concentration (<i>r</i> = -0.322, <i>p </i>= 0.004). Finally, plasma IGHG4 levels demonstrated adequate diagnostic capability, as indicated by our ROC curve analysis. In conclusion, decreased IGHG4 protein levels are significantly associated with the degree of iron overload in β-thalassemia patients and may serve as a possible biomarker for evaluating iron overload."

The identification of the beta039 mutation by Chang and Kan in 1979 marked a turning point, suggesting as main approach the molecular level by correcting the beta globin chain imbalances through gene insertion and editing. However, challenges of technology have delayed the implementation of these strategies for over four decades. In contrast, the past two decades have witnessed significant advances in the treatment of HSC disorders of the myeloid clone which are driven by a 'target cell strategy'. Many current and innovative treatments for thalassaemia are now adopting this approach, highlighting the importance of identifying suitable candidates through risk stratification. This manuscript explores the evolving understanding of thalassaemia syndromes as congenital HSC disorders of the erythroid clone and examines the implications of this perspective for the development of future treatments."

    "title": "Digital Imaging of Peripheral Blood Smear With MC-80 as a Screening Tool for Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder, poses significant global health challenges, emphasizing the importance of accurate screening methods. Traditional diagnostic tools, such as osmotic fragility and dichlorophenolindophenol tests, along with blood indices, such as mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, have limitations. Digital microscopy of peripheral blood smears is a promising alternative for objective quantification and standardization. Blood samples from 81 thalassemia screening-negative and 41 screening-positive individuals were analyzed using Mindray MC-80 Digital Morphology. Pre-classification of red blood cell (RBC) morphology using Mindray MC-80 revealed significant differences between the screening-positive and screening-negative groups. Various RBC morphologies demonstrated statistically significant variance, including hypochromic cells, schistocytes, elliptocytes, target cells, teardrop cells (p < 0.001), and ovalocytes (p = 0.002). However, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of these parameters was < 0.8, indicating a limited discriminatory power. RBC morphology showed promise in detecting subtle changes associated with thalassemia. However, it may not be sufficient for accurate screening alone, highlighting the need for complementary diagnostic approaches."

    "abstract": "Iron overload is a common complication in patients with transfusion-dependent-thalassemia that can lead to end-organ damage. Management of iron overload has considerably evolved since the early 2000s with the approval of oral iron chelators and widespread use of MRI monitoring. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 144 patients with transfusion-dependent-thalassemia treated at a single center in the US and followed since initiation of regular transfusion therapy. Patients who were receiving deferoxamine monotherapy and then switched to/added an oral chelator had a mean decrease in liver iron concentration (LIC) by 0.02 mg/g dry weight (dw) per month (0.24 mg/g dw per year) and a mean increase in cardiac T2* by 0.07 ms per month (1.68 ms per year) after starting an iron chelator (p < 0.001 for both). There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of patients with clinically-relevant cardiac iron overload (cardiac T2* < 20 ms and < 10 ms) from 2006-2010 to 2016-2020, with a trend towards a decrease in the proportion of patients with clinically-relevant hepatic iron overload (LIC > 15 mg/g dw). The introduction of oral chelators has transformed management in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and led to persistent improvements in iron burden over the years."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the detection rate of genetic abnormalities in cases of foetal gallbladder (FGB) size abnormalities to determine whether these abnormalities justify prenatal diagnosis. Two hundred and twenty-seven foetuses with gallbladder (GB) size anomalies who underwent prenatal diagnosis between January 2015 and June 2024 were included in the study. All these patients underwent chromosomal microarray and/or karyotyping, and 37 cases also underwent whole exome sequencing (WES). Two hundred and eight cases were followed up for postnatal outcomes. Then, we reviewed the literature of FGB anomalies cases with confirmed chromosomal results. The study included 227 foetuses, comprising 60 cases with isolated GB size anomalies and 167 cases with non-isolated GB size anomalies. Non-isolated GB size anomalies were associated with findings such as hyperechogenic bowel, ventriculomegaly, foetal growth restriction (FGR), cardiac anomalies, renal dysplasia and single umbilical artery. The overall diagnostic yield of genetic tests was 10.57% (24/227). Aneuploidies were identified in seven foetuses. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) were found in nine foetuses, and α0-thalassemia in five foetuses. Additionally, three pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected through WES. Foetuses with non-isolated GB size anomalies showed a higher rate of detecting genetic abnormalities compared to those with isolated GB size anomalies, with a significant difference in statistical analysis (13.2% vs. 3.3%, <i>p</i> = .033, Chi-square test). A total of eight studies, involving 407 cases met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Overall, 28 foetuses were identified to have chromosomal abnormalities (6.9%, 28/407). This study indicates that parents of foetuses with GB size anomalies should be informed about the potential for aneuploidy, pathogenic CNVs and SNVs, and genetic testing should be recommended in cases of non-isolated foetal GB size anomalies."

    "abstract": "Syphilis is a preventable and treatable disease, which continues to strike low-income countries and vulnerable populations in high-income countries. It is caused by <i>T pallidum</i>, a spirochete capable of traversing the placental barrier, with a high rate of fetal and placental infection. Congenital syphilis (CoS) has poor prognosis if left untreated. Autopsy and placental evaluation are important tools to diagnose this disease in the obstetric scenario, to reveal the correct cause of demise and prevent complications in future pregnancies. We describe the histologic findings of eleven feto-placental examinations of non-treated CoS with fetal hydrops and stillbirth. Fetal findings are variable, with hydrops, X-ray long bone metaphyseal bands and hepatic lesions as the most consistent autopsy findings. The combination of chronic and acute villitis/intervillitis is a common placental feature in CoS, and the presence of mixed inflammatory populations is a key to suspect treponemal infection. Mothers from vulnerable populations and with poor obstetric care also deserve increased efforts to rule out CoS as cause of death. This constellation of findings must lead to further testing with direct methods (PCR or tissue immunohistochemistry for <i>T pallidum</i>)."

    "abstract": "To explore the effect of the Mentzer Index (MI) in screening for children thalassemia (TT) minor. We determined the MI cutoff value of diagnosing TT minor in children by utilizing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Samples with MI values below this threshold, and no detectable gene mutations or IDA were further analyzed using Sanger sequencing or specific primer GAP-PCR. In the differential diagnosis of silent α-thalassemia (α-TT) and IDA, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the Mentzer index (MI) was 0.561. The most Youden index indicates an MI cutoff value of 16.833, with a sensitivity of 1.000 and a specificity of 0.278. For distinguishing α-TT minor from IDA, the AUC was 0.909, with an MI cutoff value of 12.24, a sensitivity of 0.875, and a specificity of 0.778. When distinguishing β-TT minor from IDA, the AUC was 0.907, with an MI cutoff value of 11.82, a sensitivity of 0.917, and a specificity of 0.768. Utilizing these MI cutoff values, three cases of rare TT genotype were identified, including a previously unreported heterozygous mutation of IVS-II-55 (T > G) in the alpha2 (α<sup>IVS-II-55(T > G)</sup>/αα). The diagnostic precision of MI is limited when differentiating between silent α-TT and IDA, but it is higher when distinguishing between α-TT minor, β-TT minor, and IDA. This study established a cutoff value for MI in our laboratory, providing reliable data for screening for TT minor and discovering rare TT genotypes among children in the local area."

    "abstract": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) is the primary cause of mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This study aimed to predict the risk of aGvHD after HCT in patients with thalassemia major using a novel predictive nomogram. A retrospective study was used to develop the prediction model. We performed retrospective analyses on 402 consecutive thalassemia patients who underwent HCT. Risk factors for aGvHD were analyzed using Cox proportional regression models. T-lymphocyte subsets were collected from 240 patients at the time of neutrophil engraftment. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression was utilized to screen the indices, with cut-off values established through restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression. The predictive model was developed by integrating these T-lymphocyte subsets with clinical features, aiming to enhance the accuracy of aGvHD risk prediction. Among 402 thalassemia patients analyzed post-transplantation, significant independent risk factors for aGvHD included matched unrelated donors, haploid-related donors, peripheral blood stem cell infusions, and donor age older than 40 years. Our RCS analysis indicated a marked increase in aGvHD risk when CD4+ T-cell counts exceeded 36 cells/μL and CD8+ T-cell counts exceeded 43 cells/μL during neutrophil engraftment. The integration of T-lymphocyte subsets with clinical risk factors into a Cox regression model demonstrated good predictive performance for assessing aGvHD risk. This study presents a novel model designed to predict aGvHD in thalassemia patients post-transplantation by utilizing T-lymphocyte data at the time of engraftment. The model facilitates the creation of personalized treatment plans, aiming to minimize the incidence of aGvHD and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "The establishment of reference systems for the standardization of hemoglobin A<sub>2</sub> (HbA<sub>2</sub>) and fetal hemoglobin (HbF), both critical for improving diagnostic accuracy in conditions such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are described. Efforts were led by the IFCC and other groups to address and reduce the variability in laboratory measurements of these hemoglobins. This document outlines the production of certified reference materials (CRMs) for HbA<sub>2</sub> and the development of a reference measurement procedure using isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Similarly, standardizing HbF is essential for supporting diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, particularly in managing sickle cell disease. HbF levels can predict disease outcomes and guide treatment plans. Significant challenges remain in achieving consistent measurement across laboratories, and the process for standardization for this minor hemoglobin has just begun. We are confident that the implementation of these reference systems will provide improved accuracy and traceability in the future."

    "abstract": "Multipotent mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) refer to a population of stem cells that exhibit distinct progenitor cell characteristics including the potential for differentiation into a wide range of cell types. MSCs have become a promising candidate for cell therapy and tissue regeneration due to their unique properties, such as their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, their capacity for expansion, self-renewal, and immune-regulatory effects. However, reports have brought attention to thrombosis-related complications associated with MSCs therapy in the last decade. As tissue factor (TF) is a powerful coagulation activator expressed by MSCs that stimulates the extrinsic coagulation pathway, we investigated the thrombotic properties of human umbilical cord MSCs (HUCMSCs) after knocking out the TF gene. MSCs populations that obtained from umbilical cord were cultured and expanded in the appropriate medium cell culture. The identity of the MSCs was verified through flow cytometry, and their ability to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Two gRNAs for Exons 1 and 2 of the TF gene have been designed and cloned into px458 vector's backbone (pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-GFP). Following transfecting of gRNAs into HUCMSCs and successfully knocking out the TF gene using GAP-PCR, the impact of normal and knockout HUCMSCs on coagulation was assessed through prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer level, clotting time (CT), and turbidity assay. Furthermore, the impact of TF knockout (TFKO) on MMP19 expression was assessed. Our results revealed that the PT was prolonged and D-dimer level was decreased in TFKO group compared to normal HUCMSCs. These findings suggest that TF gene plays a crucial role in regulating coagulation in HUCMSCs. Also, a significant reduction in MMP19 expression was observed within the TFKO group."

Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023479511). Trials from seven databases' (ClinicalTrials.gov, European Union Clinical Trials Registry, ISRCTN registry, ICTRP/trialsearch.who.int, ChiCTR.org.cn, Clinical Trial Registry India, and Cochrane Library/Trials) inception to 9 March 2024, were considered. Exclusion criteria were unrelated, duplicated, non-English, unavailable full texts, diagnostic studies, correlational studies, observational studies, abstract-only papers, reviews or conference papers. Included studies were appraised using the ten-item CASP tool to assess methodological quality. The review identified 82 RCTs utilizing CRISPR and revealed four main themes: Diseases targeted, Countries of Clinical trials, Type of interventions, and Trial trends over the years. Geographically, the United States and China lead in the number of CRISPR clinical trials, followed by the European Union. However, Africa, Asia, and South America have very few trials. Among disease classes, cancer is the most prevalent focus with 39 studies, followed by monogenetic blood diseases, like Thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia. The biological agent CTX001 and Cyclophosphamide each feature in 11 studies. The peak year for clinical trials was 2018, marked by a significant increase with 16 studies conducted. Despite conducting a comprehensive search, the majority of trials were concentrated in the United States and China. Additionally, potential oversights due to vague titles, English-only studies, and indexing issues may have occurred. Nonetheless, by incorporating data from seven distinct databases, this review significantly contributes to understanding CRISPR's utilization in therapeutic clinical trials, paving the way for future research directions. The review underscores the burgeoning interest in CRISPR-based interventions. Current trials barely tap CRISPR's potential for treating genetic diseases."

    "abstract": "Based on the relationship between the intracellular concentration of sickle hemoglobin S (HbS) and the delay that occurs prior to the onset of sickling following deoxygenation, targeting the intracellular HbS concentration is a recognized therapeutic approach for sickle cell disease (SCD). We and others have shown that restricting iron by dietary or pharmacologic means improves hematologic parameters, inflammation, and organ damage in mouse models of SCD. Clinical evidence corroborating these findings is confined to case reports and small case series studies, none of which account for treatment or <i>α</i>-thalassemia. We hypothesize that increased transferrin saturation is associated with increased mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) which in turn is associated with decreased red cell counts and worsening anemia. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the relationships between transferrin saturation and MCHC with each of the parameters that define MCHC in sickle patients (HbSS without <i>α</i>-thalassemia) and healthy volunteers (HVs). Results indicate that transferrin saturation and MCHC are positively correlated with each other in sickle patients and HV. In patients with SCD, MCHC and transferrin saturation are negatively correlated with RBC count and are not correlated with hemoglobin, whereas each is positively associated with HV. Transferrin saturation and MCHC are each positively correlated with the hemolysis marker, lactate dehydrogenase. These observations support a model where increased transferrin saturation contributes to higher intracellular HbS concentrations with subsequent increases in sickling and hemolysis in sickle patients, suggesting that pharmacologic approaches to decrease serum iron may provide a therapeutic approach for patients with SCD. <b>Trial Registration:</b> This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00011648, NCT00081523, and NCT04817670."

The identification of novel variants in globin genes and accurate assessment of hematological parameters play a crucial role in precise genetic counseling and clinical practice. Peripheral blood samples were collected for hematological analysis, including red blood cell and hemoglobin assessment, while serum ferritin levels were measured to detect iron depletion. Thalassemia carrier identification was conducted in four subjects admitted to Jiangxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital using next-generation sequencing and Gap-PCR due to the high prevalence of thalassemia in Jiangxi Province. The identified rare or novel small nucleotide variants were subsequently validated through Sanger sequencing.

Eight hundred twenty-three cardiac magnitude T2* multi-slice, multi-echo MR images from 496 thalassemia major patients (285 females, 57%), labeled for MIO level (normal: T2* > 20 ms, moderate: 10 ≤ T2* ≤ 20 ms, severe: T2* < 10 ms), were retrospectively studied. Two 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) developed for multi-slice (MS-HippoNet) and single-slice (SS-HippoNet) analysis were trained using 5-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using micro-average, multi-class accuracy, and single-class accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. CNN performance was compared with inter-observer agreement between radiologists on 20% of the patients. The agreement between patients' classifications was assessed by the inter-agreement Kappa test. Among the 165 images in the test set, a multi-class accuracy of 0.885 and 0.836 was obtained for MS- and SS-Hippo-Net, respectively. Network performances were confirmed on external test set analysis (0.827 and 0.793 multi-class accuracy, 29 patients from the CHMMOTv1 database). The agreement between automatic and ground truth classification was good (MS: κ = 0.771; SS: κ = 0.614), comparable with the inter-observer agreement (MS: κ = 0.872, SS: κ = 0.907) evaluated on the test set. The developed networks performed classification of MIO level from multiecho, bright-blood, and T2* images with good performances. Question MRI T2* represents the established clinical tool for MIO assessment. Quality control of the image analysis is a problem in small centers.

    "abstract": "Approximately 10-15% of human cancers are telomerase-negative and maintain their telomeres through a recombination-based process known as the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Loss of the alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked (ATRX) chromatin remodeller is a common event in ALT-positive cancers, but is generally insufficient to drive ALT induction in isolation. We previously demonstrated that ATRX binds to the MRN complex, which is also known to be important in the ALT pathway, but the molecular basis of this interaction remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the interaction between ATRX and MRN is dependent on the N-terminal forkhead-associated and BRCA1 C-terminal domains of NBS1, analogous to the previously reported NBS1-MDC1 interaction. A number of conserved 'SDT-like' motifs (serine and threonine residues with aspartic/glutamic acid residues at proximal positions) in the central unstructured region of ATRX were found to be crucial for the ATRX-MRN interaction. Furthermore, treatment with a casein kinase 2 inhibitor prevented the ability of ATRX to bind MRN, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues by casein kinase 2 is also important for the interaction. Finally, we show that a functional ATRX-MRN interaction is important for the ability of ATRX to prevent induction of ALT hallmarks in the presence of chemotherapeutically induced DNA-protein crosslinks, and might also have implications for individuals with ATR-X syndrome."

    "abstract": "The regulation of γ-globin expression is crucial due to its beneficial effects on diseases like β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) is a significant suppressor of γ-globin, and microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting BCL11A have been shown to alleviate this suppression. In our previous high-throughput sequencing, we identified an 11.32-fold increase in miR-129-5p expression in β-thalassemia patients. However, the regulatory mechanisms of miR-129-5p in the context of erythroid differentiation remain to be elucidated. Our study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-129-5p in γ-globin regulation and erythropoiesis. We measured miR-129-5p levels in peripheral blood from β-thalassemia major and intermedia patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, dual-luciferase reporter assays, miRNA pull down assays and western blot analyses were conducted to examine the effects of miR-129-5p on γ-globin expression and BCL11A repression. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation were assessed using cell counting kit-8, Wright-Giemsa, and benzidine staining, and flow cytometry assays. The expression levels of miR-129-5p were significantly elevated in β-thalassemia patients and positively correlated with γ-globin synthesis while negatively correlating with liver damage. miR-129- 5p enhanced γ-globin gene expression in K562 and HUDEP-2 cells by effectively repressing BCL11A. Overexpression of miR-129-5p inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/G0 phase, promoted apoptosis and stimulated erythroid differentiation and maturation. Conversely, inhibition of miR-129-5p produced opposite cellular effects. miR-129-5p acts as a positive regulator of erythroid differentiation and γ-globin synthesis. It offers a promising miRNA target for activating the γ-globin gene and reducing ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia patients."

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States, with the highest prevalence among Black or African American populations. While advances in care have improved survival, comprehensive state-level data on the prevalence of SCD remain limited, which hampers efforts to optimize health care services. To address this gap, the Colorado Sickle Cell Data Collection (CO-SCDC) program was established in 2021 as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's initiative to enhance surveillance and public health efforts for SCD. The objectives of this study were to describe the establishment of the CO-SCDC program and to provide updated estimates of the prevalence and birth prevalence of SCD in Colorado, including geographic dispersion. Additional objectives include evaluating the accuracy of case identification methods and leveraging surveillance activities to inform public health initiatives. Data were collected from Health Data Compass (a multi-institutional data warehouse) containing electronic health records from the University of Colorado Health and Children's Hospital Colorado for the years 2012-2020. Colorado newborn screening program data were included for confirmed SCD diagnoses from 2001 to 2020. Records were linked using the Colorado University Record Linkage tool and deidentified for analysis. Case definitions, adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Registry and Surveillance System for Hemoglobinopathies project, classified cases as possible, probable, or definite SCD. Clinical validation by hematologists was performed to ensure accuracy, and prevalence rates were calculated using 2020 US Census population estimates. In 2019, 435 individuals were identified as living with SCD in Colorado, an increase of 16%-40% over previous estimates, with the majority (n=349, 80.2%) identifying as Black or African American. The median age of individuals was 19 years. The prevalence of SCD was highest in urban counties, with concentrations in Arapahoe, Denver, and El Paso counties. Birth prevalence of SCD increased from 11.9 per 100,000 live births between 2010 and 2014 to 20.1 per 100,000 live births between 2015 and 2019 with 58.5% (n=38) of cases being hemoglobin (Hb) SS or HbSβ0 thalassemia subtypes. The study highlighted a 67% (n=26) increase in SCD births over the decade, correlating with the growth of the Black or African American population in the state. The CO-SCDC program successfully established the capacity to perform SCD surveillance and, in doing so, identified baseline prevalence estimates for SCD in Colorado. The findings highlight geographic dispersion across Colorado counties, highlighting the need for equitable access to specialty care, particularly for rural populations. The combination of automated data linkage and clinical validation improved case identification accuracy. Future efforts will expand surveillance to include claims data to better capture health care use and address potential underreporting. These results will guide public health interventions aimed at improving care for individuals with SCD in Colorado."

The cumulative 10-year incidence of gallstone disease was 4.2% in patients with congenital RBC disorders and 1.7% among comparators. Adjusted csHR's [95% confidence interval] were 8.1 [6.8, 9.7] for hereditary spherocytosis; 3.3 [1.6, 6.8] for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; 21.6 [10.6, 44.1] for pyruvate kinase deficiency; 3.7 [1.9, 7.0] for sickle cell disease; 0.8 [0.4, 1.6] for sickle cell trait; 1.5 [1.1, 2.2] for α-thalassemia trait; 1.8 [1.4, 2.3] for β-thalassemia minor; and 2.1 [1.8, 2.6] for other congenital hemolysis. We found a markedly higher risk of hospital-registered gallstone diseases in nearly all groups of patients with congenital RBC disorders compared with the general population."

    "title": "Coexistence of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and Sticky Platelet Syndrome: A Lethal Combination in A Young Patient with Thrombophilia and Haemorrhagic Diathesis.",
    "abstract": "The coexistence of hypercoagulability and bleeding diathesis in the same patient represents a potentially lethal combination due to its complex management. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and sticky platelet syndrome (SPS) are classified as rare diseases due to their low prevalence. vEDS is associated with bleeding tendencies caused by vascular wall fragility, while SPS is characterized by atypical arterial and venous thrombosis. We report a 27-year-old woman, smoker and regular consumer of energy drinks, with a medical history of subclinical hypothyroidism, minor thalassemia, recurrent joint sprains, high myopia, and anterior mitral valve prolapse, who was diagnosed with both vEDS and SPS type I. The patient experienced a catastrophic progression over a short time period, marked by numerous thrombotic and bleeding episodes, ultimately leading to a fatal outcome. This report documents the first known case of concurrent vEDS and SPS, highlighting the complexity and challenges in the management of these two rare conditions together. The interplay between these syndromes necessitates careful clinical consideration and the development of tailored management strategies to mitigate associated risks. This underscores the crucial role of the internist in overseeing such cases. Further studies are needed to explore new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving survival rates and outcomes for patients with this unique combination of disorders. The coexistence of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and sticky platelet syndrome (SPS) creates a unique clinical scenario where the underlying connective tissue weakness and platelet hyperaggregability synergistically increase the risk of both thrombotic and haemorrhagic events, complicating management strategies.Internists must assume a pivotal role in the integrated management of patients with vEDS and SPS, facilitating a multidisciplinary strategy that not only addresses the dual risk of thromboembolic and haemorrhagic complications but also emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment algorithms and ongoing surveillance to optimize long-term outcomes."

    "title": "Estimation of HbA1c Levels in Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia Patients in Comparison With Normal Healthy Individuals.",
    "abstract": "Introduction HbA1c values used for diagnosing and treating diabetes can be affected by factors such as red blood cell lifespan, hemolysis, red cell transfusion, and the presence of minor Hb species like HbA2 and HBF in hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease, homozygous HbC disease, HbSC disease, and β-thalassemia. This study aims to compare HbA1c levels in transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients and healthy individuals. Materials and methods This is a cross-sectional comparative study. This study comprises two population groups. The first group includes 35 TDT patients and the second group consists of 35 non-thalassemic individuals who were matched for age (±1 year), gender, and BMI (±1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The patients were selected from the pediatric outpatient department (OPD), thalassemia ward in the pediatric department, and medicine OPD. Written informed consent/assent was obtained from the participants. A 3 ml fasting venous blood sample for fasting blood sugar (FBS), HbA1c, and complete blood count (CBC) values was obtained in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials on the scheduled blood transfusion day (pretransfusion samples). Samples were then sent to an in-house accredited lab for testing and analysis. HbA1c was performed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. Data was compared using a t-test. Qualitative parameters were compared between groups by X<sup>2</sup> square analyses. A multivariate linear regression model was used to explore the independent contribution of an individual predictor to HbA1c variability. Results In the study, 85.7% of patients with TDT had HbA1c levels in the diabetic range (>6.4%). In comparison, none of the control group patients had HbA1c values in the diabetic range. The mean HbA1c level was 6.94% in TDT cases and 5.3% in the control group, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Elevated FBS levels in the prediabetic range (>100 mg/dl, <126mg/dl) were observed in 25.7% TDT cases. All 35 controls had normal FBS levels (<100 mg/dl). No significant difference was found in FBS levels between cases (92.97 (±9.141) mg/dL) and controls (89.20 (±7.584) mg/dL) (p = 0.065). However moderately positive correlation exists between FBS and HbA1C (r =.470, p = 0.004) and between age and HbA1C (r = 0.335, p = 0.049). Conclusions The use of HbA1c as a screening tool for diabetes mellitus (DM) or assessment of glycemic control is inappropriate in TDT patients. The levels could be falsely elevated, as we found out in our study. In conditions where there is a mismatch between HbA1c and FBS levels, as seen in TDT patients, plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes. It is advised to use alternative indices such as fructosamine levels, glycated albumin, and continuous glucose monitoring."

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has proven to be an effective curative intervention for children with β-thalassemia major (β-TM). They are susceptible to growth disorders due various factors. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the growth and development of children with β-TM both before and after undergoing allo-HSCT during a one-year follow-up period. According to the international reference standards for child growth established by the World Health Organization in 2006, participants were divided into two groups based on their Z scores: weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ), height-for-age Z scores (HAZ), and body mass index-for-age Z scores (BAZ) before allo-HSCT. The first group included children with normal nutritional levels (-2≤ Z scores ≤2), while the second group consisted of children with malnutrition (Z scores <-2 or >2). Measurements of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded at six time points: prior to allo-HSCT (T0), and 1 month (T1), 3 months (T3), 6 months (T6), 9 months (T9), and 12 months (T12) following the procedure. Among the 56 children diagnosed with β-TM, 25% were malnourished prior to HSCT. In the group with normal nutrition, mean WAZ (P=0.04) and HAZ (P<0.001) values were significantly higher at T12 compared to T0; however, mean BAZ was similar at T12 and T0 (P=0.61). In contrast, in the malnutrition group, no significant differences were observed in mean WAZ (P=0.12), HAZ (P=0.27), or BAZ (P=0.75) values between T12 and T0. Notably, the incidence of increased HAZ was significantly more prevalent in children aged seven years or younger than in those older than seven years (P=0.01). Children diagnosed with β-TM who had normal nutritional levels at the time of allo-HSCT showed significant growth improvements within one year of follow-up compared to their pre-transplantation state. Additionally, the age at which allo-HSCT was performed may substantially influence post-transplantation growth rates. Regular monitoring of growth and development from the time of diagnosis is crucial to ensure optimal nutritional status at the time of allo-HSCT, thereby enhancing the prognosis for these children after transplantation."

    "abstract": "Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) presents a promising therapeutic option for pediatric transfusion-dependent thalassemia, particularly in the scarcity of matched donors. Despite its potential, the comprehensive evaluation of this method through large-scale prospective studies remains lacking. This study aims to systematically summarize the efficacy and safety of haplo-HSCT in thalassemia, thereby providing further evidence-based insights for clinical practice. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through June 2024 to ensure a robust analysis of the available evidence. Data extraction was independently performed by 2 reviewers. The analysis utilized the inverse variance method with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to calculate the pooled proportion. To assess the heterogeneity among the studies, Cochran's Q test and Higgins' I-squared statistical methods were utilized. A random-effects model was employed to accommodate the variability between study results. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were explored differences in outcomes based on conditioning regimens and graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Conditioning regimens were categorized into reduced-intensity conditioning and myeloablative conditioning regimens. GVHD prophylaxis was classified into post-transplantation cyclophosphamide and non-post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed data from 10 studies encompassing 356 patients with thalassemia who underwent haplo-HSCT. Out of these, 328 patients survived until the follow-up date, resulting in a pooled overall survival rate of 92.4% (95% CI, 86.9-96.7; I² = 54.32%). The thalassemia-free survival was 84.5% (95% CI, 75.3-91.9; I² = 77.64%), and the graft failure rate was 8.1% (95% CI, 2.5-16.4; I² = 81.78%). The transplantation-related mortality stood at 7.4% (95% CI, 3.6-12.5; I² = 55.74%), with infections noted as the primary cause of death. The pooled proportion of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), grade 2-4 aGVHD, and grade 3-4 aGVHD were 29.6% (95% CI, 16.7-42.5, I² = 92.48%), 22.3% (95% CI, 10.1-42.1, I² = 80.06%), and 9.1% (95% CI, 2.8-17.7, I² = 67.92%), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant differences in these outcomes when comparing myeloablative conditioning to reduced-intensity conditioning, or post-transplantation cyclophosphamide to non-post-transplantation cyclophosphamide prophylaxis. However, variations in sample size, patient's age and geographic region among the studies suggest these factors as potential sources of heterogeneity. Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation utilizes donors who are partially HLA-matched, typically family members, making it a viable option for transfusion-dependent thalassemia when fully matched donors are not available."

    "abstract": "Patients with β-thalassemia continue to have several unmet needs. In non-transfusion-dependent patients, untreated ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia have been associated with a variety of clinical sequelae, with no treatment currently available beyond supportive transfusions. In transfusion-dependent forms, lifelong transfusion and iron chelation therapy are associated with considerable clinical, psychological, and economic burden on the patient and health care system. Luspatercept is a novel disease-modifying agent targeting ineffective erythropoiesis that became recently available for patients with β-thalassemia. Data from randomized clinical trials confirmed its efficacy and safety in reducing transfusion burden in transfusion-dependent patients and increasing total hemoglobin level in non-transfusion-dependent patients. Secondary clinical benefits in patient-reported outcomes and iron overload were also observed on long-term therapy, and further data from real-world evidence studies are awaited."

    "abstract": "India, the most populous nation in the world, also has a high frequency of the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) allele globally. The Arab Indian HbS haplotype in India is characterized by a relatively high percentage of fetal Hb, with widely varying frequencies of α-thalassemia. Hence, sickle cell disease (SCD) in India was perceived to be mild. Advances in the past decade in screening and SCD management have revealed that the severity of SCD in India is comparable to many other parts of the world. Clinical features in India include vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, renal involvement, stroke, etc, at a relatively young age. Once a fatal disease of childhood, the majority of patients born with SCD are expected to survive into adulthood, largely because of improvements in comprehensive care programs including newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis, transcranial Doppler, and hydroxyurea therapy. Several centers are performing hematopoietic stem cell transplants successfully for SCD. To address the urgent need to control and manage SCD in India's population, the Government of India launched the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission, with significant funding for large-scale measures to screen, treat, counsel, educate, and develop technologies and novel therapies and gene therapies."

    "abstract": "Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hepatic glyoxylate metabolism leading to nephrolithiasis and kidney failure. PH1 is caused by mutations on the AGXT gene encoding alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). The AGXT gene has two haplotypes, the major (Ma) and the minor (mi) alleles. This review summarizes the role of the minor allele on the molecular pathogenesis and the clinical manifestations of PH1. PH1 shows high genetic variability and significant interindividual variability. Although the minor haplotype is not pathogenic on its own, it may be crucial for the pathogenicity of some mutations or amplify the effect of others, thus affecting both symptoms and responsiveness to Vitamin B6, the only pharmacological treatment effective in a selected group of PH1 patients. In the last years, new drugs based on RNA-interference are available for patients nonresponsive to Vitamin B6, but no specific biomarkers are available to predict disease course and severity. Therefore, a clinical assessment of PH1 taking into account molecular analysis of the mutations and the allelic background and the possible synergism among polymorphic and pathogenic variants should be encouraged to promote approaches of personalized medicine that improve the management of available resources."

This systematic review examines the burden of illness and current management approaches in non-HCT SOS/VOD. We searched Embase, Medline, and grey literature sources for non-HCT SOS/VOD studies published 2002-2023. Inclusion criteria were studies of any design reporting incidence, diagnosis, underlying disease and any ongoing treatment at the time of SOS/VOD onset, management of non-HCT SOS/VOD, clinical burden, health-related quality of life, healthcare resource use, costs, and patients' unmet needs. Studies investigating pulmonary VOD or SOS/VOD related to the ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloids were excluded.Two authors independently screened results, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Motheral scale for retrospective studies, Newcastle-Ottawa scale for prospective studies and case control studies, the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials, and the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for case series. Results were synthesized narratively. Ninety-two studies were included; 57 % were retrospective cohort studies and 70 % were conducted in the US or Europe. The study populations included hematological and solid tumor cancers, various indications for liver transplant, Wilms' tumor, and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Non-HCT SOS/VOD occurs most frequently in people with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Approximately 35 % of oxaliplatin-treated CRLM patients and 5 % of ALL and AML patients have non-HCT SOS/VOD. Diagnosis varies according to initial disease setting. Defibrotide is the most frequently reported treatment. Most studies did not clearly report their data sources or methods of outcome assessment. Non-HCT SOS/VOD occurs in diverse disease conditions, therefore guidelines on diagnosis and treatment are needed to optimize management in clinical practice."

Diagnostic performance of each of red blood cell parameter and their combination derived from logistic regression analysis in predicting α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia trait were determined. The total 587 Thai pregnant women were included in the analysis, consisting of 136 cases of α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia trait and 451 normal controls. Diagnostic performance analysis revealed that, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) provided a sensitivity of 98.5 % and a false positive rate of 20.2 %.

The combined-parameters prediction model including hemoglobin (Hb), MCV, MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), and red blood cell (RBC) count, demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.992, sensitivity of 99.3 %, and much lower false positive rate of 4 %. The combined-parameter prediction model provided excellent diagnostic performance with low false positive rate. The application of the prediction model could decrease unnecessary PCR method for α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia testing, thereby decreasing the cost of investigation.

We showed that prime editing could efficiently introduce Hb CS mutations in both human erythroblast cell lines (an average frequency of 32%) and primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy donors (an average frequency of 27%). By targeting the established Hb CS homozygous erythroblasts, we achieved an average frequency of 32% <i>in situ</i> correction without selection. Notably, prime editing corrected the Hb CS mutation to wild type at an average frequency of 21% in HSPCs from three patients with hemoglobin H Constant Spring (HCS). Erythrocytes that differentiated from prime-edited erythroblasts or HSPCs exhibited a significant reduction in the amount of α<sup>CS</sup>-globin chains. Insertions and deletions on <i>HBA2</i> locus and Cas9-dependent DNA off-target editing were detected with relatively low frequency after prime editing.

In the context of thalassemias, extramedullary hematopoiesis is more frequently observed in beta-thalassemia intermedia patients, with thoracic paravertebral extramedullary hematopoiesis being relatively common. However, extramedullary hematopoiesis-related pleural effusion is a rare occurrence. Herein, we report a 43-year-old female patient, who presented with worsening dyspnea and a massive pleural effusion. Her medical history includes beta-thalassemia intermedia with known paravertebral extramedullary hematopoiesis sites and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy a month ago. The absence of pleural fluid from recent prior imaging pointed toward the rapid accumulation of fluid. After a thorough diagnostic workup, we attributed the effusion to thoracic paravertebral extramedullary hematopoiesis. The patient was effectively treated with drainage of the effusion after thoracentesis and antibiotics. On follow-up, she had a stable radiographic image without pleural fluid recurrence. Extramedullary hematopoiesis-associated pleural effusion should be in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusion, in cases of compatible medical history."

    "abstract": "In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of thalidomide by clinically observing 48 individuals with β-thalassemia who have been administered thalidomide in small and medium doses over a period of two years. Thalidomide's efficacy was gauged by tracking hemoglobin (Hb) level alterations post its administration. Liver and kidney function impact was measured through tests for alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Hemolysis effects were assessed via total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin level measurements. Thrombosis detection was performed using ultrasound examinations of deep vein vessels in the upper and lower extremities. Any adverse effects of thalidomide were recorded during the observation period. Lower dose thalidomide effectiveness was evaluated by monitoring Hb level changes following dosage reduction. The overall response rate (ORR) among the 48 participants was 91.7% (44 out of 48), with the main reaction (MaR) reaching 72.9% (35 out of 48). Hepatorenal toxicity was not monitored during the 2-year observation period, and there was no improvement in hemolysis. Most adverse effects were mild, with no instances of venous thrombosis and no cases of grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity. When the observation group was divided into three age categories (12-14 years old, 14-18 years old, and over 18 years old), there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of adverse reactions among the three groups. As there were some adverse reactions in ten cases, the treatment dose was reduced for them. The maintenance efficacy rate at one year of observation was 90% (9 out of 10). This study confirmed that thalidomide in small doses over a 2-year observation period is effective, and has no instances of grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity. Long-term maintenance with small doses is recommended for enhanced safety."

    "abstract": "Severe malaria is associated with impaired nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS)-dependent vasodilation, and reversal of this deficit improves survival in murine models. Malaria might have selected for genetic polymorphisms that increase endothelial NO signaling and now contribute to heterogeneity in vascular function among humans. One protein potentially selected for is alpha globin, which, in mouse models, interacts with endothelial NOS (eNOS) to negatively regulate NO signaling. We sought to evaluate the impact of alpha globin gene deletions on NO signaling and unexpectedly found human arteries use not only alpha but also beta globin to regulate eNOS. The eNOS-hemoglobin complex was characterized by multiphoton imaging, gene expression analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation studies of human resistance arteries. Novel contacts between eNOS and hemoglobin were mapped using molecular modeling and simulation. Pharmacological or genetic disruption of the eNOS-hemoglobin complex was evaluated using pressure myography. The association between alpha globin gene deletion and blood pressure was assessed in a population study. Alpha and beta globin transcripts were detected in the endothelial layer of the artery wall. Imaging colocalized alpha and beta globin proteins with eNOS at myoendothelial junctions. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that alpha globin and beta globin form a complex with eNOS and cytochrome b5 reductase. Modeling predicted negatively charged glutamic acids at positions 6 and 7 of beta globin to interact with positively charged arginines at positions 97 and 98 of eNOS. Arteries from donors with a glutamic acid-to-valine substitution at beta globin position 6 (sickle trait) exhibited increased NOS-dependent vasodilation. Alpha globin gene deletions were associated with decreased arterial alpha globin expression, increased NOS-dependent vasodilation, and lower blood pressure. Mimetic peptides that targeted the interactions between hemoglobin and eNOS recapitulated the effects of these genetic variants on human arterial vasoreactivity. Alpha and beta globin subunits of hemoglobin interact with eNOS to restrict NO signaling in human resistance arteries. Malaria-protective genetic variants that alter the expression of alpha globin or the structure of beta globin are associated with increased NOS-dependent vasodilation. Targeting the hemoglobin-eNOS interface could potentially improve NO signaling in diseases of endothelial dysfunction such as severe malaria or chronic cardiovascular conditions."

    "abstract": "Ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) is defined as the abnormal differentiation and excessive destruction of erythroblasts i n the bone marrow, accompanied by an expanded progenitor compartment and relative reduction in the production of reticulocytes. It is a defining feature of many types of anemia, including β-thalassemia. GATA1 is an essential transcription factor for erythroid differentiation, known to be implicated in hematological conditions presenting with IE, including β-thalassemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. However, little is known about the role of GATA1 in the erythropoietic defects recently described in sickle cell anemia (SCA). In the present study, we performed a detailed characterization of the role of GATA1 and ineffective erythropoiesis in SCA using both in vitro and in vivo assay systems. We demonstrate a significant decrease in GATA1 protein levels during SCA erythropoiesis and a concomitant increase in oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that an increase in the activity of the inflammatory caspase, caspase 1, was driving the decrease in GATA1 levels during SCA erythropoiesis and that, upon inhibition of caspase 1 activity, SCA erythropoiesis was rescued and GATA1 levels partially restored. Our study further elucidates the defect in erythropoiesis in SCA, and may therefore help in the development of novel approaches to normalize the bone marrow niche prior to stem cell transplantation, or facilitate the production of healthy stem cells for gene therapy."

Main outcomes (serum Ca, P, Ca/P ratio, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin) defined overt and subclinical HPT. Albumin-adjusted Ca was lower (p = 0.004) and P higher (p = 0.002) comparing IOD to controls. Ca/P ratio was lower in IOD than controls (p < 0.001); PTH did not change. P was higher and Ca/P lower comparing TMI to HC and controls (p < 0.001); Ca did not change. A total of 28/65 IOD (43%) had HPT (9.2% overt, 33.8% subclinical) whose prevalence was higher in TMI than HC (p < 0.001). Ca/P ratio <2.32 had sensitivity 71.4% and specificity 83.9% in detecting overt/subclinical HPT. IOD with Ca/P ratio <2.32 (1.78 in SI) had an almost 12-fold increased likelihood to be affected by HPT (OR 12.92 [3.90-42.82]; p < 0.001). Ca/P (p = 0.002) was the only independent risk factor for HPT at multivariate analysis. HPT, especially non-classical subclinical HPT, is common in adult IOD with higher prevalence in TMI than HC. Ca/P ratio <2.32 is accurate to screen for overt/subclinical HPT and should be periodically evaluated in IOD to early detect an unbalanced mineral metabolism, and to monitor a possible evolution from subclinical to overt HPT."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of anaemia and haemoglobinopathies, particularly beta-thalassemia in the tribal population of the Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district of Telangana. The sample consisted of a tribal population (Banjara) that visited voluntary blood camps set up in tribal settlements, local schools, and the Gram-panchayat office, in collaboration with local healthcare workers. Haemoglobin measurements (Anaemia) and Mentzer index of whole blood (EDTA) samples were used as diagnostic screening tools for categorising the population at risk of beta-thalassemia. HPLC was used as a confirmatory test. The study included a total of <i>n</i> = 479 (68% females and 32% males) voluntary adult participants of Banjara. Based on the haemoglobin levels, 105 females (32%) were found to be anaemic as compared to 24 males (15.5%). Among the female population, a small percentage of individuals had severe anaemia (1.9%), while most had mild (80%) or moderate anaemia (18%); on the other hand, males primarily had moderate anaemia. Out of the total screened population, 6.7% (5.2% with low Hb levels (anaemic), 3.3% by MI) were found to be thalassemia based on anaemia and Mentzer index as a screening tool. The prevalence of beta-thalassemia was found 6.7% in the Banjara population."

    "abstract": "Deferasirox (DFX) is a once-daily oral iron chelator with proven dose-dependent efficacy in patients with thalassemia major (TM). The reason for switching from DFX dispersible tablets (Exjade<sup>®</sup>) to DFX film-coated tablets (Jadenu<sup>®</sup>) was intolerance. Many patients also reported that deferasirox<sup>®</sup> did not taste good. In this study, we compared the effect of Jadenu<sup>®</sup> and Exjade<sup>®</sup> on satisfaction, convenience, cardiac/liver MRI T2*, serum ferritin levels, and biochemical profiles in patients with thalassemia major. Sixty-two patients with thalassemia over 2 years of age, who had iron overload indicated by chelation therapy, were randomly divided into two groups. The first group (n = 32) is treated with Exjade<sup>®</sup>, and the second group (n = 30) is treated with Jadenu<sup>®</sup>. Laboratory investigations included alkaline phosphatase (ALK), alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate transferase (AST), and serum ferritin levels. Cardiac/liver MRI T2* levels and patient satisfaction and convenience, were assessed before and 1 year after starting therapy. The study found that 53.3% of Jadenu<sup>®</sup> patients were satisfied with the taste of the medication compared to only 12.5% of Exjade<sup>®</sup> patients, which was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Additionally, 40% of Jadenu<sup>®</sup> patients were satisfied with the ease of taking the medication compared to 28.1% of Exjade<sup>®</sup> patients, and again, the difference was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = 0.047). A comparison of the cardiac MRI T2* levels between the two studied groups showed no significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.851). Jadenu<sup>®</sup> offers patients an improved formulation that can be taken on an empty stomach, has a better taste, and presents fewer gastrointestinal tolerability concerns. Overall, patient satisfaction is higher with Jadenu<sup>®</sup>, which may improve adherence and reduce the frequency and severity of complications associated with iron overload. This, in turn, may help mitigate cardiovascular and hepatic complications from iron overload in the long term. https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/search/result?query=IRCT20210830052346N1."

The aim of this study is to investigate the most common types of 3.7 kb deletions in the Iranian population and, on the other hand, to compare the extent of deletion of the different reported types. In this study, 50 Iranian α-thalassemia carriers in whom the 3.7 kb deletion had been previously identified by multiplex gap PCR, were further investigated by MLPA. A map of the region where the 3.7 kb deletion occurs was also created and the extents of the reported types were compared. Approximately 90% of chromosomes with 3.7 kb deletion in this study had MLPA type D and 10% had MLPA type F. This study showed that subtype I of the 3.7 kb deletion reported by Higgs and his coworkers can be classified into at least 5 MLPA types. The results of this study can be used to complete the information on the distribution of the 3.7 kb deletion subtypes in different populations. Investigation of further populations using higher resolution methods may lead to more information being obtained in this field."

This study investigated the iron deposition in different organs of transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients and its correlation. This cross-sectional study involved 54 TDT patients who underwent MRI T2* examinations of the heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and pituitary. The study analyzed the iron deposition in each organ and evaluated the correlation of iron deposition using Spearman's test. Among the 54 patients with TDT, liver iron overload was found in 49/54 (90.7%) cases, pancreas iron overload in 43/54 (79.6%) cases, spleen iron overload in 18/26 (69.2%) patients, heart iron overload in 20/54 (37.0%) cases, and kidney iron overload in 8/54 (14.8%) patients. Most patients (66.7%) with iron overload in the liver but not in the heart exhibited spleen iron abnormalities. Pituitary T2* and pancreas T2* (r = 0.790), pituitary T2* and kidney T2* (r = 0.692), kidney T2* and pancreas T2* (r = 0.672) showed positive correlation (all p < 0.05). Patients with TDT exhibited significant organ-specific iron overload. These findings highlight the importance of routine MRI screening for monitoring and managing iron overload in patients with TDT. Pituitary, pancreas, and kidney may have similar iron-loading mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Silent cerebral infarcts (SCIs) are present in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia, but the pathophysiology of SCIs is not fully understood. Previous studies mainly focused on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in patients with severe SCD (HbSS/HbSβ°) but not in milder forms of SCD (HbSC/HbSβ<sup>+</sup>) and thalassemia despite the high prevalence of SCIs in these patients. In this work, we studied the cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism, and SCI lesion load in 75 severe and 26 mild adult SCD patients, 18 thalassemia patients (as anemic comparison group), and 30 healthy controls before and after a vasodilatory challenge with acetazolamide. Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher in patients with severe SCD and thalassemia compared to patients with mild SCD and controls (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Conversely, oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) were significantly lower in patients with severe SCD and thalassemia compared to other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In contrast, no difference in SCI volumes was found between mild and severe SCD and thalassemia patients. After acetazolamide administration, oxygen delivery increased less in severe SCD and thalassemia patients compared to other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and CMRO<sub>2</sub> decreased only in severe SCD patients (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Given the reduced CMRO<sub>2</sub> values in severe SCD and thalassemia patients, we conclude that reduced cerebral oxygen consumption in these patient groups is mostly related to anemia. Our data suggest that the pathophysiology of SCIs in patients with milder forms of SCD might be more related to prior episodes of anemia or other sickle cell-related factors."

Prophylactic antigen matching is commonly used to prevent alloimmunization, but the evidence supporting this common practice is very limited. The report by Wolf et al. summarizes the latest literature on this topic and importantly finds that there is insufficient evidence to recommend prophylactic extended antigen matching (beyond ABO, RhD, RhCcEe and K). In an era of chronic blood shortages, this approach may help to assure patient access to elective surgery and cellular therapies, while preserving the supply of extensively antigen-matched red cells for patients with specific needs.

In addition, there is no clear guidance from the relevant scientific societies regarding pediatric and adolescent donors. To assess the actual use of PAD in pediatric (up to 14 years) and adolescent (aged 15-18 years) family donors in relation to BM HSC donation in the five years 2017-2021, a specific online questionnaire was administered to blood establishments and clinical units of pediatric transplantation programs responsible for BM HSC collection. Adherence to the project was 100% (18/18 centers). During the five-year period considered, 273 BM HSC donors (205 pediatric and 68 adolescent) were registered. Forty percent of the non-trait carrier donors who underwent PAD received iron therapy in preparation for BM HSC donation; only 4.8% of the pediatric and none of the adolescents had hemoglobin values below the age limit at donation. Finally, 66.4% of pediatric donors and 15.4% of non-trait carrier adolescent donors who did not undergo PAD received homologous transfusions during BM harvest. The present study highlights the highly heterogeneous criteria for the use of PAD (including calculating of the volume of whole blood collected) and the lack of a specific policy in preparation for BM HSC donation, either from non-trait carrier donors or those with sickle cell or thalassemia trait, both pediatric and adolescent."

    "abstract": "Anemia in pregnancy has negative impacts on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and has been described as an issue of health equity. The primary aim of our study was to describe the rates of anemia near delivery and assess whether this correlates with neighbourhood-level income status. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pregnant persons delivering from January 2012 through December 2022 at 2 large academic centres. We used log-binomial regression to estimate the association between neighbourhood-level income quintile and anemia near delivery, defined as a hemoglobin <110 g/L within 30 days of delivery, controlling for maternal age, parity, thalassemia trait, number of fetuses, blood group, and service provider type. Secondary maternal and fetal outcomes were analyzed descriptively. A total of 51 782 deliveries were included; the majority were singleton (97%) pregnancies delivered vaginally (61%). Although 77% of patients had a complete blood count done within 30 days of delivery, only 13% had a ferritin value checked within 9 months of delivery. Approximately 30% of all patients were anemic near delivery, with higher rates of anemia in lower income quintiles; patients in the lowest income quintile were 18% more likely to be anemic than those in the highest income quintile (relative risk 1.18; 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Even within a high-resource academic setting, anemia in pregnancy is common. Given the high rates of anemia in our study, particularly, amongst patients in lower income quintiles, widespread targeted educational and system interventions are required to ensure equitable patient care."

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the severity of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, sleep quality, and fatigue and explore the relationship between sleep quality and laboratory parameters. Twenty-eight patients and 37 healthy volunteers were included. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Fatigue Severity Scale were used.

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is an arterial blood vessel disease that begins and progresses by turning macrophages into foam cells. Uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), cholesterol esterification and cholesterol efflux are the most important factors in the formation of foam cells and play an important role in atherosclerosis. The present study is based on the data obtained from the PubMed database (1961-2024) using the MeSH search terms \"Atherosclerosis\", \"Macrophages\" and \"Foam cells\". Reviews for writing the main text and non-English-language articles were excluded. The interaction between ox-LDL and macrophages plays an important role in plaque initiation and promotion processes. Macrophages abnormally digest ox-LDL, resulting in the accumulation of lipids and formation of foam cells. This is an important step in the development of atherosclerosis. Also, several other factors such as inflammatory factors, growth factors, hormones, etc. can play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions or counteract it by affecting the formation of foam cells. Several factors can affect the progression of atherosclerosis by affecting macrophage activity or its conversion to foam cells. Also, some of these factors play a protective role against the development and atherosclerosis progression. In this paper, we reviewed some of these factors and their effect on atherosclerosis."

This research aims to investigate the relation between circulating levels of Galectin-3 and the incidence of GDM, and to evaluate its potential as a biomarker for monitoring and early detection of the disease. A thorough search of the literature has been performed using databases such as Scopus, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Library and PubMed. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compute the effect size from individual records and pooled using the Random-effect model. Our meta-analysis synthesized data from 9 studies, encompassing 1,286 participants (533 GDM patients and 753 healthy pregnant controls). The findings demonstrated a considerable increase in Galectin-3 levels among individuals diagnosed with GDM as compared to the healthy control (SMD = 0.929; CI: 0.179-1.679; <i>p</i> = 0.015), with observed heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 87%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed the influence of factors such as age, BMI, study design, and sample type on Galectin-3 levels. A meta-regression analysis further identified trends indicating that levels of Galectin-3 are linked to gestational age, specific geographical areas, and sample size. Increased levels of Galectin-3 exhibit a significant association with GDM, indicating its prospective utility as a biomarker for early detection and risk assessment. Further research is warranted to elucidate its regulation and clinical implications in GDM management. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40200-024-01461-z."

With its genetic heterogeneity, variable penetrance and expressivity, DBAS poses significant diagnostic challenges, necessitating advancements in genetic testing for improved accuracy. Here, we present the case of an 18-year-old male with a long-standing macrocytic anemia that remained undiagnosed despite standard whole exome sequencing (WES). Revisiting a family-trio WES analysis with clinical insight led to the identification of a likely pathogenic variant in the Ribosomal Protein S17 (<i>RPS17</i>) gene, previously masked due to analytical challenges and conservative filter settings. This variant, an initiation codon mutation, was confirmed in heterozygosity in both the proband and his mother through Sanger sequencing. Comprehensive imaging studies showed no malformations or organ anomalies in either individual, except for mild esophageal stenosis observed in both. <i>RPS17</i> mutations, particularly those affecting the initiation codon, have previously been linked to the DBAS phenotype, but strong pathogenic association has not yet been firmly established. Our case warns of potential underdiagnosis of <i>RPS17</i> variants in DBAS, highlighting the importance of clinical context and interdisciplinary collaboration in interpreting WES data to avoid false-negative results."

    "abstract": "Gilteritinib is a commonly used targeted drug for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the emergence of gilteritinib resistance greatly reduces the therapeutic effect. RING finger protein 38 (RNF38), a protein with RING Finger domain and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, has been implicated in tumorigenesis and drug resistance. However, the role and mechanism of RNF38 in the gilteritinib resistance of AML remains unclear. Normal AML cells were treated with gilteritinib to construct gilteritinib-resistant cells (MV4-11/Gilteritinib and MOLM-13/Gilteritinib). CCK8 assay, TUNEL staining and EdU assay were used to assess gilteritinib resistance, cell apoptosis and proliferation. The protein levels of autophagy-related markers, RNF38 and LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (LMX1A) were determined by western blot. Also, RNF38 and LMX1A mRNA levels were tested using qRT-PCR. Autophagic flux was assessed using mRFP-GFP-LC3 labeling, and autophagosome numbers was counted under transmission electron microscopy. Co-IP assay was employed to analyze interaction between RNF38 and LMX1A. The effects of LMX1A and RNF38 on AML tumorigenesis were analyzed by in vivo experiments. In gilteritinib-resistant AML cells, autophagy-related markers, mRFP-GFP-LC3 signals and autophagosome numbers were significantly enhanced. Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA could suppress gilteritinib resistance in AML cells. RNF38 knockdown inhibited gilteritinib resistance and autophagy in AML cells. Mechanistically, RNF38 reduced LMX1A expression by inducing its ubiquitination. RNF38 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of LMX1A on gilteritinib resistance and autophagy in AML cells, as well as AML tumor growth in vivo, while these effects could be abolished by proteasome inhibitor MG132. RNF38 induced autophagy to promote gilteritinib resistance in AML by increasing the ubiquitination of LMX1A."

    "abstract": "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder linked to haploinsufficiency of CREBBP (RSTS1) and EP300 (RSTS2) genes. Characteristic features often include distinctive facial traits, broad thumbs and toes, short stature, and various degrees of intellectual disability. The clinical presentation of RSTS is notably variable, making it challenging to establish a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, except for specific variants which cause the allelic Menke-Hennekam syndrome. Trio exome analysis, data collection via networking and GeneMatcher platforms, transcript processing analysis, and DNA methylation profiling were performed. We identified two unrelated patients with de novo variants in EP300 (NM_001429.4: c.3671+5G>C; c.3671+5_3671+8delGTAA) predicted to cause in-frame exon 20 skipping, confirmed in one patient. In silico 3D protein modeling suggested that exon 20 deletion (comprising 27 amino acids) likely alters the structural conformation between the RING_CBP-p300 and HAT-KAT11 domains. Clinically, both patients displayed severe RSTS2-like clinical features, including autism spectrum disorder, speech delay, hearing loss, microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, alongside ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Additionally, one patient developed early-onset colorectal cancer. DNA methylation profiling in Subject #1 confirmed RSTS but did not align with the specific episignatures for RSTS1 or RSTS2. We propose that skipping of exon 20 in EP300 is associated with a distinct form of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome featuring clinical characteristics not fully aligning with RSTS1 or RSTS2. Our findings increase the understanding of RSTS genetic and molecular basis and stress the need for further research to establish definitive genotype-phenotype correlations."

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death, is characterized by iron accumulation that results in the production of reactive oxygen species. This further causes lipid peroxidation and damage to the cellular components, eventually culminating into oxidative stress. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of ferroptosis in the pathophysiological development and progression of various diseases such as β-thalassemia, hemochromatosis, and neurodegenerative disorders like AD and PD. Extensive efforts are in progress to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the role of ferroptosis in these conditions, and chelation therapy stands out as a potential approach to mitigate ferroptosis and its related implications in their development. There are currently both synthetic and natural iron chelators that are being researched for their potential as ferroptosis inhibitors. While synthetic chelators are relatively well-established and studied, their short plasma half-life and toxic side effects necessitate the exploration and identification of natural products that can act as efficient and safe iron chelators. In this review, we comprehensively discuss both synthetic and natural iron chelators as potential therapeutic strategies against ferroptosis-induced pathologies."

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of anti-human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) antibody positivity on early hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) results in patients with thalassemia major (TM). One hundred and twenty-four HLA-matched HSCTs were performed in patients with TM between 2015 and 2022. Ninety-one patients were screened for anti-HLA antibodies by testing panel reactive antigens (PRA). Demographic and transplantation characteristics of patients were recorded. The presence of PRA was tested with the Antibody Testing Assay (Luminex LIFECODES HLA Antibody Identification System). The number of PRA-positive patients was 54. There was no relationship between acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, grade of GVHD, and viral reactivation of the patients. However, platelet engraftment took around 3 days longer in the PRA-positive group (p = 0.05). The median number of erythrocyte transfusions was significantly higher in PRA-positive patients in the post-transplant period (p = 0.003), as was the median number of platelet transfusions (p = 0.003). Treosulfan conditioning increased the stable mixed chimerism (MC) rate by 3.8-fold (p = 0.011). In contrast, reduced rates of MC were found in patients who received matched unrelated donor cells or peripherally derived stem cells (p = 0.011 and p = 0.039, respectively) in the posttransplantation period in TM patients. PRA-positivity did not affect MC (p = 0.478). However, 80% of patients who had primary graft failure (n = 5; p = 0.59) and 75% of patients who died (n = 4) were PRA positive (p = 0.64), but these results were statistically insignificant due to the low number of patients. Anti-HLA antibodies primarily delayed platelet engraftment in TM patients and increased the erythrocyte and thrombocyte transfusion requirements. Although PRA positivity was more common in patients with primary graft failure or who died, there was no statistically significant impact of PRA positivity on chimerism, acute or chronic GVHD, viral activation, or mortality rates."

Samples detected as suspicious for -α<sup>4.2</sup>deletion were rechecked by conventional Gap-PCR. Those samples suspected of having -α<sup>4.2</sup>deletions were finally confirmed with specific primers for Gap-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Of the 32,083 samples, 25 samples (0.08%) were detected as suspected of having -α<sup>4.2</sup> deletion by flow-through hybridization. However, upon reevaluation wtih conventional Gap-PCR reagents capable of detecting -α<sup>4.2</sup> deletion, all were found to be negative for the deletion. Specific primers for Gap-PCR were designed, and fusion gene fragments were amplified. DNA sequencing of the HBA gene showed a 7-base mutation corresponding to the α-thalassemia fusion gene. Among the 25 samples, 22 were heterozygous carriers. Three samples were combined: one with Hb QS, one with β-thalassemia, and one with Hb G-Honolulu.Most hematological indices and capillary electrophoresis results were in the normal reference range. The fusion gene was present in 0.08% of the population in the Guangzhou region of Guangdong province, southern China. Conventional genetic methods tend to misdiagnose the fusion gene but can be effectively screened with flow-through hybridization."

    "title": "Beta Thalassemia in Children: Established Approaches, Old Issues, New Non-Curative Therapies, and Perspectives on Healing.",
    "abstract": "Despite a decrease in prevalence and incidence rates, beta thalassemia continues to represent a significant public health challenge worldwide. In high-resource settings, children with thalassemia have an open prognosis, with a high chance of reaching adulthood and old age with a good quality of life. This is achievable if transfusion therapy is properly managed, effectively mitigating ineffective erythropoiesis and its associated complications while also minimizing excessive iron accumulation. Adequate iron chelation is essential to maintain reactive forms of iron within the normal range throughout life, thus preventing organ damage caused by hemosiderosis, which inevitably results from a regular transfusion regimen. New therapies, both curative, such as gene therapy, and non-curative, such as modulators of erythropoiesis, are becoming available for patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Two curative approaches based on gene therapy have been investigated in both adults and children with thalassemia. The first approach uses a lentivirus to correct the genetic defect, delivering a functional gene copy to the patient's cells. The second approach employs CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to directly modify the defective gene at the molecular level. No non-curative therapies have received approval for pediatric use. Among adults, the only available drug is luspatercept, which is currently undergoing clinical trials in pediatric populations. However, in many countries around the world, the new therapeutic options remain a mirage, and even transfusion therapy itself is not guaranteed for most patients, while the choice of iron chelation therapy depends on drug availability and affordability."

    "abstract": "Genetic newborn screening (NBS) has already entered the phase of common practice in many countries. In Germany, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are currently a mandatory part of NBS. Here, we describe the experience of six years of genetic NBS including the prevalence of those three diseases in Germany. Samples and nucleic acids were extracted from dried blood spot cards, commonly used for NBS. A qPCR assay was used to detect disease-causing variants for SMA and SCD, and the detection of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) was performed for SCID screening. The results of the NBS of over 1 million newborns for SMA, approximately 770,000 for SCID and over 410,000 for SCD are discussed in detail. In these newborns, we have identified 121 cases of SMA, 15 cases of SCID and syndrome-based immunodeficiencies and 77 cases of SCD or β-thalassemia. The flexibility of multiplex qPCR is assessed as an effective tool for incorporating different molecular genetic markers for screening. The processing of dried blood spot (DBS) filter cards for molecular genetic assays and the assays are described in detail; turn-around times and cost estimations are included to give an insight into the processes and discuss further options for optimization. The identified cases are in the range expected for the total number of screened newborns, but present a more exact view on the actual prevalences for Germany."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies, namely β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD), are hereditary diseases, characterized by molecular genetic aberrations in the beta chains of hemoglobin. These defects affect the normal production of hemoglobin with severe anemia due to less or no amount of beta globins in patients with β-thalassemia (quantitative disorder), while SCD is a serious disease in which a mutated form of hemoglobin distorts the red blood cells into a crescent shape at low oxygen levels (qualitative disorder). Despite the revolutionary progress in recent years with the approval of gene therapy and gene editing for specific patients, there is an unmet need for highlighting the mechanisms influencing hemoglobin production and for the development of novel drugs and targeted therapies. The identification of the transcription factors and other genetic modifiers of hemoglobin expression is of utmost importance for discovering novel therapeutic approaches for patients with hemoglobinopathies. The aim of this review is to describe these complex molecular mechanisms and pathways affecting hemoglobin expression and to highlight the relevant investigational approaches or pharmaceutical interventions focusing on restoring the hemoglobin normal function by linking the molecular background of the disease with the clinical perspective. All the associated drugs increasing the hemoglobin expression in patients with hemoglobinopathies, along with gene therapy and gene editing, are also discussed."

    "abstract": "Liver iron overload is associated with conditions such as hereditary hemochromatosis, thalassemia major, and chronic liver diseases. The liver-related outcomes, patient outcomes, and treatment recommendations of these patients differ depending on the cause and extent of iron overload. Accurate quantification of the liver iron concentration (LIC) is critical for effective patient management. This review focuses on the application of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the precise quantification and prognostic assessment of liver iron overload. In recent years, the use of dual-energy CT and the emergence of MRI-based sequences (such as UTE, QSM, Dixon, and CSE technologies) have significantly increased the potential for noninvasive liver iron quantification. However, the establishment of internationally standardized imaging parameters, postprocessing procedures, and reporting protocols is urgently needed for better management of patients with liver iron overload."

The Indonesian government has introduced supplementary food programs for stunted children, but the results have been less satisfactory. This may be due to the presence of anaemia and comorbid diseases. Haematology tests and inflammation markers are necessary to identify these conditions. This study aimed to examine the anaemia profiles and inflammation markers in stunted children under two years old. <b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional descriptive design with cluster samples and consecutive analysis was used. The study was conducted between December 2023 and March 2024 at the West Nusa Tenggara Hospital and Palabuhanratu Sukabumi Hospital laboratories. Samples were obtained from various Public Health Centres in Sukabumi, West Java, North Maluku, and West Nusa Tenggara. Data collection comprised interviews, measurements, and the assessment of haematology, biochemical, and inflammatory markers. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20, which includes descriptive analysis, correlation, comparison, and chi-square tests. <b>Results</b>: Two hundred and ten stunted children were identified with various anaemias and comorbidities. These anaemias included suspected thalassemia (38.1%), iron deficiency (18.1%), and anaemia of chronic diseases (13.3%). Based on the inflammatory markers obtained, TB was suspected (21.4%), inflammatory bowel disease (18.1%) was suspected, and allergic proctocolitis was suspected (31.9%). <b>Conclusions</b>: Analysis of the anaemia profiles and inflammatory markers revealed various types of anaemia and suspected comorbidities in stunted children. It is recommended that anaemia profiles and inflammation markers be assessed at the primary healthcare level."

Gain-of-function variants in the <i>PIEZO1</i> gene are known to cause dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) also termed hereditary xerocytosis. This is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by variable-degree anemia with a tendency toward hemolysis, erythrocyte dehydration and iron overload. While the diagnostic workflow for DHS is well-established, diagnosis is often delayed due to overlapping clinical features with other hemolytic anemias and the pleiotropic effects of PIEZO1 variants. We describe the case of a Greek patient with a compensating hemolysis since birth. DHS diagnosis was established only after a prolonged history of repeated investigations spanning from his early life to 70 years of age, when a conclusive testing was achieved."

This prospective study aimed to compare magnetic resonance imaging T2* and SWE results of the liver in children with thalassemia major (TM). Patients with TM who had regular follow-ups were included. SWE was performed first, followed by MRI T2*. In addition, a healthy control group of the same age group, known to have no liver disease, was recruited. For these participants, only SWE was performed, and their results were compared with the SWE parameters of the TM patients. The study included 38 patients and 25 individuals who made up the control group. The groups with mild, moderate, and severe iron overload according to MRI T2* were compared in terms of SWE with parameters, and no statistically significant difference was found. However, when comparing the SWE parameters between the control group and patients, the median, average, and standard values were found to be statistically significantly higher in the patient group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.026). When comparing MRI T2* results, the median, average, and standard values were found to be statistically significantly higher in the patients with normal and mild iron overload (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.033). SWE is an effective, more accessible, and easy-to-apply method for demonstrating early changes in the liver in pediatric patients with TM.

    "abstract": "Patients with betathalassemia have higher risk of various metabolic disturbances. The literature presents conflicting results about the patterns of abnormal lipid profile among patients with betathalassemia. This systematic review aimed to assess dyslipidemia patterns among patients with betathalassemia when compared with healthy individuals. The methods used were adherent to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematic searches of the literature were done across Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Regional Portal of the World Health Organization Virtual Health Library. Calculation of standardized mean difference (SMD) estimates and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were done through Jamovi software. The systematic review included 21 studies meeting the criteria for the analyses. Patients with beta-thalassemia major displayed significantly elevated triglyceride levels (SMD: 0.448, 95% CI, 0.214 to 0.682; P < .001) and reduced total serum cholesterol (SMD: -2.26 (95% CI-2.834 to -1.678; P < .001), as well as decreased levels of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (SMD: -1.88, 95% CI, -2.614 to -1.147; P < .001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (SMD: -1.32, 95% CI, -1.786 to -0.860; P < .001). Similarly, beta-thalassemia intermedia patients exhibited comparable lipid profile abnormalities to those with beta-thalassemia major. Conversely, beta-thalassemia minor patients only showed significantly lower total serum cholesterol levels (SMD: -0.66, 95% CI, -0.860 to -0.472; P < .001). Evidence indicates alterations in lipid profile markers among beta-thalassemia patients. The findings indicate the importance of assessing hypertriglyceridemia and hypocholesterolemia in these patients, especially those with major and intermedia forms, as these lipid profile abnormalities increase the risk of cardiovascular disease."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Microcytic anemia has long been associated with thyrotoxicosis, but this correlation has been largely forgotten, and few literature references to this phenomenon exist since the 1980s. No mechanism for this association has been proposed. CASE REPORT Here, we present the case of a 56-year-old man who developed clinically significant hyperthyroidism in the setting of Graves' disease and simultaneous microcytic anemia. He was treated with methimazole, and the hyperthyroidism symptoms and biochemical parameters remitted. Simultaneously, the red cell microcytosis and anemia remitted. Notably, iron deficiency as indicated by high serum ferritin was not present during the acute illness, and the ferritin level decreased with methimazole treatment. CONCLUSIONS The supraphysiological concentration of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) gained entry to the cells, bound to hormone receptors (TR), activating a set of responsive genes, via thyroid response elements (TREs). In red cell precursors, which were notably not iron deficient, proteotoxic stress was induced, leading to activation of HRI kinase activity as part of the integrated stress response. The phosphorylation of eIF2 on the critical Ser51 led to depletion of the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA) by preventing eIF2 from exchanging GDP for GTP. Formation of the preinitiation complex was hampered, and translation of the abundant globin mRNA was attenuated. Decreased globin synthesis in turn was coupled to smaller red cell size, as occurs in thalassemia."

In this Prospective study, we have compared the efficacy of three chelation regimens being used in our country. It has been conducted at PBTS, Fatmid Foundation and Children Hospital Lahore. 60 thalassemia major patients, were divided into 3 groups according to their mode of chelation. Patients in group I were on oral iron chelator deferiprone, 7 days per week. Thalassemics in group II were on parenteral iron chelator deferoxamine given subcutaneously for 4 days a week, and group III patients were on combination therapy, deferiprone for 5 days & deferoxamine given twice weekly. The assessment of chelation was done by measurement of serum ferritin and 24-hour urinary iron excretion at the start of the study and then after six months of follow-up. To assess the hepatic iron, hepatic MRIs were also performed. Ferritin levels were maximally decreased in group II, followed by group III, with no significant reduction in group I. However, a statistically significant difference in mean urinary iron excretion (increased) was seen in group III. The hepatic iron was very high in all three groups as shown by the hepatic MRI. Combination chelation therapy is the most effective chelation therapy in iron-overloaded patients. It helps to improve compliance and increases urinary iron excretion. Patients on DFX had the lowest degree of hepatic siderosis even though it was considerably higher than the normal population."

Reverse dot blot hybridization (RDB-PCR), Gap-PCR and nested PCR were used to detect the thalassemia genotype. Clinical and hematological parameters of 1076 individuals of thalassemia were collected to analyze the correlation between genotype and phenotype. Among 2997 subjects, 1076 cases diagnosed as thalassemia gene carrier or patients, with detection rate 35.9 %, among which Southeast Asian deletion (--<sup>SEA</sup>)/αα was the most common α-thalassemia genotype (48.4 %) and one rare genotype was detected: HKαα/--<sup>SEA</sup> (0.1 %). Subjects with thalassemia alone showed the least severe symptoms of anemia with higher red blood cell count (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb), lower red blood cell distribution width (RDW) than those with iron deficiency (ID) or iron overload (IO) (p < 0.05). The Hb, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) levels in gene carriers of α-thalassemia were higher than those of β-thalassemia, while RBC, RDW and serum ferritin (SF) levels were lower than the later(p < 0.05). Among individuals with --<sup>SEA</sup>/αα, the Hb, MCV, MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and SF levels of subjects≥19 years old were higher than those of ≤18 years old.

A single sample K-S test was used to determine the normality of the data. We used the multiple logistic regression model. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported for both bivariate and multivariable analyses. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study screened a total of 916,295 participants, comprising 452,474 in 2021 and 463,821 in 2022. The sex distribution was 51.7% male and 48.3% female, with a mean age (± standard deviation) of 43 (±11.8) in 2021 and 41 (±11.9) in 2022. Among the participants, there were 196 sickle cell disease (SCD) cases and 4610 carriers. Additionally, 1069 participants tested positive for infectious diseases. Sex was a notable factor in SCD, HIV, HBV, and HCV cases. Our findings highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and intervention efforts through programs such as premarital screening and genetic counseling programs. These initiatives are crucial for identifying at-risk individuals and reducing the burden of genetic disorders and infectious diseases with targeted public health strategies.

Here, we describe the case of a 24-week-old fetus from a Chinese family with healthy parents. The fetus presented with hydrops fetalis and abnormal limb posturing. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed that the fetus had a heterozygous 17p12 deletion, which is associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Trio-based exome sequencing (ES) analysis revealed that the deletion was inherited from the father, who has a normal phenotype. Trio-based ES identified a novel nonsense variant (c.229C>T, p.Q77*) and a rare nonsense variant (c.325C>T, p.R109*) in the mediator complex subunit 11 (MED11) gene. Both parents were heterozygous carriers for one of the variants in MED11. This is the first study to report the presence of hydrops fetalis and abnormal limb posturing phenotypes in fetuses with MED11 variants. These results expand the prenatal phenotypic spectrum of NDDRSB, which is helpful for genetic counseling and early prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities.

Effective treatment plans typically require the comprehensive integration of cell morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology. These plans also consider patient-specific factors such as disease stage, age, and genetic mutation status. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), more \"AI + medical\" application models are emerging. In clinical practice, many AI-assisted systems have been successfully applied to the diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases, enhancing precision and efficiency and offering valuable solutions for clinical practice. This study summarizes the research progress of various AI-assisted systems applied in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases, with a focus on their application in morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology diagnosis, as well as prognosis prediction and treatment. Using PubMed, Web of Science, and other network search engines, we conducted a literature search on studies from the past 5 years using the main keywords \"artificial intelligence\" and \"hematological diseases.\" We classified the clinical applications of AI systems according to the diagnosis and treatment. We outline and summarize the current advancements in AI for optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases, as well as the difficulties and challenges in promoting the standardization of clinical diagnosis and treatment in this field. AI can significantly shorten turnaround times, reduce diagnostic costs, and accurately predict disease outcomes through applications in image-recognition technology, genomic data analysis, data mining, pattern recognition, and personalized medicine. However, several challenges remain, including the lack of AI product standards, standardized data, medical-industrial collaboration, and the complexity and non-interpretability of AI systems. In addition, regulatory gaps can lead to data privacy issues. Therefore, more research and improvements are needed to fully leverage the potential of AI to promote standardization of the clinical diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases. Our results serve as a reference point for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of hematological diseases and the development of AI-assisted clinical diagnosis and treatment systems. We offer suggestions for further development of AI in hematology and standardization of clinical diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Gaucher is an autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage disorder. The incidence of this disease is rare with a global estimate of around 1 in 57,000 to 1 in 75,000. Gaucher's disease is caused by a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene. Common symptoms of this disease include hepatosplenomegaly, moderate neurological symptoms, and late‑onset skeletal alterations. However, Gaucher can sometimes have rare presentations that lead to a delayed diagnosis in patients. This report discusses two adult cases of Gaucher's disease (type 1) with the same mutation but with unusual symptoms. One patient was a 44-year-old man who had been experiencing chronic cough since he was 10 years old, and the other patient was a 27-year-old woman with itching, both atypical symptoms of Gaucher. Bronchodilators and prednisolone were administered for chronic cough and antihistamines and prednisolone were given for the itching, but little to no improvement was seen. Sonography tests revealed that both cases had splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and liver malfunction, characteristic of Gaucher's disease. Bone marrow aspiration tests confirmed the presence of Gaucher's cells in their bones. The level of glucocerebrosidase enzyme in both cases was less than 1.5 nmol/mL/hour. Whole exon sequencing confirmed a mutation on exon 8 of the GBA1 gene in a homozygous form in both cases, resulting in a transversion mutation (C > G) at position c.798, leading to the substitution of phenylalanine 266 with leucine. Both patients were of Bakhtiyari ethnicity and had parents who were in a consanguineous marriage. After receiving Cerezyme treatment, both cases experienced a disappearance of their cough and itching symptoms. This report highlights the importance of recognizing the unusual presentation of Gaucher's disease especially in regions with high rates of consanguineous marriage and thalassemia. This knowledge can aid physicians in making accurate diagnoses and providing appropriate treatment."

    "title": "G-quadruplex stabilizer CX-5461 effectively combines with radiotherapy to target α-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked-deficient malignant glioma.",
    "abstract": "Inactivation of α-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) represents a defining molecular feature in large subsets of malignant glioma. ATRX deficiency gives rise to abnormal G-quadruplex (G4) DNA secondary structures, enhancing replication stress and genomic instability. Building on earlier work, we evaluated the extent to which pharmacological G4 stabilization selectively enhances DNA damage and cell death in ATRX-deficient preclinical glioma models. Using the G4 stabilizer CX-5461, we treated patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) in vitro and GSC flank and intracranial murine xenografts in vivo to evaluate efficacy as both a single agent and in combination with ionizing radiation (IR), the latter a central element of current treatment standards. CX-5461 promoted dose-sensitive lethality in ATRX-deficient GSCs relative to ATRX-intact controls. Mechanistic studies revealed that CX-5461 disrupted histone variant H3.3 deposition, enhanced replication stress and DNA damage, activated p53-independent apoptosis, and induced G2/M arrest to a greater extent in ATRX-deficient GSCs than in ATRX-intact counterparts. These data were corroborated in vivo, where CX-5461/IR treatment profoundly delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing ATRX-deficient flank xenografts. Histopathological analyses revealed decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and significant G4 induction, replication stress, and DNA damage in CX-5461-treated tumors, both alone and in combination with IR. Finally, despite suboptimal blood-brain-barrier penetration, systemic CX-5461 treatment induced tangible pharmacodynamic effects in ATRX-deficient intracranial GSC models. In totality, our work substantively demonstrates efficacy and defines mechanisms of action for G4 stabilization as a novel therapeutic strategy targeting ATRX-deficient malignant glioma, laying the groundwork for clinical translation."

    "title": "Impacts of economic sanctions on population health and health system: a study at national and sub-national levels from 2000 to 2020 in Iran.",
    "abstract": "Formal evidence regarding the effects of sanctions on population health status and the health system is scarse in Iran. Given the intricate and multifaceted nature of sanctions, a nuanced understanding of their impact is imperative. We aimed to investigate the magnitude and effects of sanctions on population health and healthcare system during the last two decades in Iran. This is a mixed-methods research. We quantified the impact of sanctions using 28 indicators, i.e. macroeconomic, healthcare resources and health outcomes indicators from 2000 to 2020. The concurrent qualitative study aimed to explore the pathway of the effect by considering perceptions of both patients and health policy makers towards sanctions; Interview data was analyzed using content analysis. This study was conducted in Iran at both national and sub-national levels. Our findings revealed that the trend of 11 indicators (39.2%) had changed after the change point in 2009; four indicators (14.2%) significantly deteriorated after the change point. Further, five indicators revealed significant increases during the sanctions period: Out-of-Pocket payment (OOP), household expenditure on food and mortality rates due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), thalassemia and hypertension. Our qualitative analysis revealed that patients identified availability, cost and quality of medicines and healthcare services as the most significant challenges that compromised population's health. From the policy makers' perspective, the effect of sanctions on health system functions and infrastructures, i.e. economic, political, social, educational and research had significant repercussions on population health. We could not find compelling evidence to establish significant associations between the imposition of sanctions and the trend of population health. Nevertheless, our qualitative study revealed people's deteriorating life experiences, e.g. increasing catastrophic health expenditure, limited access to necessary medicine, medical equipment, procedures and interventions, imposed by sanctions, with ultimate reducing impact on the overall quality of life. It seems that sanctions have negatively affected financial and physical access to medication and healthcare services. Nonetheless, Iran has demonstrated remarkable resilience against their highly detrimental effects, maybe due to its established economic infrastructure and healthcare system."

    "title": "Effect of voxelotor on cerebral perfusion and cerebral oxygen metabolism and cardiac stress in adult patients with sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is complicated by silent cerebral infarcts (SCIs), for which anemia is an important risk factor. Despite normal oxygen delivery (OD), cerebral vascular reserve (CVR), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) are diminished in SCD, possibly causing the formation of SCIs. Voxelotor inhibits polymerization by increasing the hemoglobin oxygen binding, ameliorating hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, anemia is related to cardiac complications. Our aims were to assess the effect of voxelotor on markers of cerebral perfusion, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and markers of cardiac stress in SCD patients. Cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism were measured with MRI before and after 3 months of voxelotor treatment (1500 mg/day) in 18 adults with SCD (HbSS/HbSβ<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia). Hemoglobin levels significantly increased (p = .001) and markers of hemolysis decreased (p < .05). OD increased from 6.5 (IQR, 6.0-7.1) mL O<sub>2</sub>/100 g/min to 8.1 (IQR, 7.2-8.7) mL O<sub>2</sub>/100 g/min (p = .001). CBF and CVR did not change. CMRO<sub>2</sub> decreased from 2.0 (IQR, 1.9-2.1) mL O<sub>2</sub>/100 g/min to 1.9 (IQR, 1.6-2.1) mL O<sub>2</sub>/100 g/min (p = .03). N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels decreased (p = .048) and maximum tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity (TRV<sub>max</sub>) normalized in all but one patient with increased TRV<sub>max</sub>. Voxelotor treatment in patients with severe SCD did not decrease CBF despite increased Hb levels. Cerebral oxygen metabolism slightly decreased, despite raised OD, most likely due to drug-induced increase in oxygen binding. Nonetheless, voxelotor improved clinically validated markers of cardiac stress."

    "abstract": "Objective This study aimed to identify the risk factors for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Child Health, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from March 25, 2024, to September 25, 2024. A total of 300 patients under 18 years of age, diagnosed with TDT, were included in the study. Relevant demographic, clinical, and laboratory investigations were conducted for each patient, with AIHA diagnosed based on the Coombs test. Risk factors, including demographic data, disease characteristics, transfusion history, clinical factors, and laboratory parameters, were recorded and analyzed. The significance of these risk factors was assessed by using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the independent t-test for continuous variables, comparing Coombs test-compatible and incompatible patients. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The mean±SD age of participants in this study was 6.82±4.2 years with an age range of one to 16 years. The male gender was 56.33%. The results of the Coombs test showed that 48.66% of these children had developed AIHA. The comparison between incompatible and compatible patients at Coombs test showed that age of patients (5.87±3.93 vs. 7.68±4.28 years, p = 0.00), age at the time of diagnosis (2.21±0.99 vs. 4.64±3.03 years, p = 0.00), age at the time of first infusion (3.05±1.28 vs. 5.49±3.2 years, p = 0.00), transfusion interval < 3 weeks (48.6% vs. 37%, p = 0.04) and duration of transfusion (2.87±3.2 vs. 2.21±1.93 years, p = 0.03) were the significant risk factors in the development of AIHA. Conclusion The patient's age, age at diagnosis, age at the time of first transfusion, the transfusion interval, and the duration of blood transfusion are the significant risk factors influencing the development of AIHA."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (TDβT) is a genetic disorder characterised by reduced or absent β-globin chain synthesis, resulting in chronic anaemia. Treatment consists of regular blood transfusions and chelation therapy to limit iron overload and its negative effects on organs (e.g. heart, lungs and liver). Despite improved life expectancy with transfusions and chelation therapy, TDβT patients experience poor quality of life and impaired exercise capacity (mainly due to muscle deconditioning and reduced cardiac inotropism). The aims of this review are (i) to discuss the role of organ dysfunction in the impairment of exercise capacity and reduced quality of life of TDβT patients; and (ii) to discuss physical activity as a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the multifactorial impact of the disease."

    "title": "RAS signaling pathway is essential in regulating PIEZO1-mediated hepatic iron overload in dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis.",
    "abstract": "PIEZO1 encodes a mechanoreceptor, a cation channel activated by mechanical stimuli. Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in PIEZO1 cause dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS), or xerocytosis, a pleiotropic syndrome characterized by anemia and iron overload. DHS patients develop hepatic iron overload independent of the degree of anemia and transfusion regimen. PIEZO1-GoF variants suppress hepcidin expression in both hepatic cellular model and constitutive/macrophage-specific Piezo1-GoF mice model. Therefore, PIEZO1-GoF variants regulate hepcidin expression by a crosstalk between hepatocytes (HCs) and macrophages with a still unknown mechanism. Transcriptomic and proteomics analysis in the human hepatic Hep3B cells engineered for the PIEZO1-R2456H variant (PIEZO1-KI) revealed alterations in the actin cytoskeleton regulation, MAPK cascade, and RAS signaling. These changes mainly occur through a novel key regulator, RRAS, whose protein and mRNA levels are regulated by PIEZO1 activation and inhibition. This regulation was further confirmed in C57BL/6 mouse primary HCs treated with Yoda-1 and/or GsMTx-4. Indeed, PIEZO1-KI cells exhibited hyper-activated RAS-GTPase activity that is rescued by PIEZO1 inhibition, restoring expression of the hepcidin gene HAMP. A negative correlation between RAS signaling and HAMP regulation was confirmed by inhibiting RAS-GTPase and MEK1-2 activity. Conversely, rescued HAMP gene expression requires downregulation of RRAS, confirming negative feedback between RAS-MAPK and BMP/SMADs pathways in HAMP regulation. We demonstrated that PIEZO1-GoF variants influence the actin cytoskeleton organization by activating the hepatic RAS signaling system. Understanding the role of RAS signaling in regulating iron metabolism could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies in DHS and other conditions characterized by iron overload."

    "abstract": "Diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34R/V-mutant (DHG-H3G34) is characterized by poor prognosis and lack of effective treatment options. DHG-H3G34R further harbor deactivation of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX; DHG-H3G34R_ATRX) suggesting a unique interaction of these 2 oncogenic alterations. In this study, we dissect their cell biological interplay, investigate the impact on telomere stabilization, and consequently validate a targeted therapy approach. We characterized patient-derived primary pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) models for telomere-maintenance mechanisms, DNA damage stress (including protein expression, pH2AX/Rad51 foci, cell-cycle arrest) and their sensitivity towards poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) combinations. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used for modeling the disease. The anticancer activity of PARPi combinations in vivo was studied in Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) and orthotopic in vivo experiments. Finally, we treated a DHG-H3G34R_ATRX patient with PARPi combination therapy. We elaborate that alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a key characteristic of DHG-H3G34R_ATRX. A dominant cooperative effect between H3G34R and ATRX loss in ALT activation also became apparent in iPSCs, which endogenously exert telomerase activity. In both, patient-derived DHG-H3G34R_ATRX models and H3G34R+/ATRX- iPSCs, the ALT-phenotype was associated with increased basal DNA damage stress, mediating synergistic susceptibility towards PARPi (talazoparib, niraparib) combinations with topoisomerase-I inhibitors (topotecan, irinotecan). In a first-of-its-kind case, treatment of a DHG-H3G34R_ATRX patient with the brain-penetrant PARP inhibitor niraparib and topotecan resulted in significant tumor reduction. Our preclinical and clinical data strongly support the further development of PARPi together with DNA damage stress-inducing treatment regimens for DHG-H3G34R_ATRX."

The current study utilized cross sectional research design. A representative group of children with Thalassemia (n=60) and children undergoing dialysis (n=60) with ages ranging from 6-14 years were included in the sample. The sample was drawn from Children's Hospital and Sundas Foundation from February 2023 to August 2023 through a purposive sampling technique. Psychological distress significantly correlates negatively with general health (-.34**) and life satisfaction (-.44**) in Children with Thalassemia. A significant negative relationship is also observed between psychological distress and general health (-.43**) and life satisfaction (-.54**) in Children undergoing Hemodialysis. Children undergoing hemodialysis experience more psychological distress whereas children with thalassemia have better general health. However, no significant difference was found in life satisfaction. The findings of the present study will be helpful for healthcare professionals and clinical psychologists to develop strategies and training programs which can increase resilience among patients. Training the patients and caregivers regarding how to fight chronic illnesses will lead to an improvement in their quality of life. Psychological distress is higher in children undergoing hemodialysis and general health is also not good but the level of satisfaction is almost equal between the two groups. This is justified that chronic illnesses do not preclude children from leading happy and satisfying lives."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a group of genetic disorders that result in a lack of hemoglobin (Hb) production. Children with thalassemia rely on regular blood transfusions for survival, which places a significant burden on their families and negatively impacts their quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to assess QOL from the perspective of parents of thalassemic children in Medina City, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 52 parents in Medina through September and October 2023 using a socio-demographic and clinical characteristic questionnaire and an assessment of parents' QOL. The study was conducted among 52 parents in Medina, with a mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 44.4 (9.5). Most participants (63.5%) were males, 90.4% were married, and 61.5% had one child with thalassemia. The majority (84.6%) had a blood transfusion every three weeks, and 80.8% had Hb before transfusion less than 9 gm/dL. The mean (SD) QOL and health score was 246.4 (51.2) out of 400. The parent's low income (p<0.001) and being non-Saudi parents (p=0.017) were significant factors for low QOL and health. Parents with thalassemic children revealed moderate QOL and health in Medina City, Saudi Arabia. Low income and expatriation negatively affected the parents' QOL and health. These results emphasize the need for financial support through assistance programs to alleviate the financial burden on these families. Additionally, specialized thalassemia treatment centers should be established to ensure easy access to comprehensive healthcare services."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease are among the most prevalent genetic blood disorders globally. These conditions arise from mutations in the β-globin gene, leading to defective hemoglobin production and resulting in anemia. Current treatments include γ-globin inducers (eg, Hydroxyurea), blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Recently approved disease-modifying agents and promising gene therapies offer hope, yet their broad application is constrained by scalability challenges. Traditionally, research and development for β-globinopathies have focused on γ-globin induction. However, the ε-globin variant, which is active during early embryonic development and subsequently silenced prenatally, was once considered noninducible by postnatal pharmacological means. Recent studies indicate that, akin to γ-globin, enhancing ε-globin expression could compensate for impaired β-globin synthesis, potentially ameliorating the clinical manifestations of β-globinopathies. This review critically examines the viability of ε-globin induction as a therapeutic strategy for β-thalassemia and sickle cell diseases. It also delves into the burgeoning research on the mechanisms governing ε-globin silencing and its pharmacological reactivation. We conclude with a discussion of prospective research directions and drug development initiatives aimed at exploiting ε-globin's therapeutic promise."

    "abstract": "Pathological cardiac hypertrophy stands as a pivotal mechanism contributing to diverse cardiovascular diseases, ultimately leading to heart failure. Despite its clinical significance, the intricate molecular mechanisms instigating pathological cardiac hypertrophy remain inadequately understood. In this study, we aim to further reveal its complex pathogenesis by exploring the role of Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2) in modulating pathological cardiac hypertrophy. We used phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and also generated cardiac-specific knockout mice and adeno-associated virus serotype 9-Faim2 mice to evaluate the function of FAIM2 in pathological myocardial hypertrophy. Furthermore, unbiased RNA-sequencing analysis was used to identify the direct target and corresponding molecular events contributing to FAIM2 function. Ultimately, our study revealed a downregulation of FAIM2 expression in phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and pressure overload-induced hypertrophic hearts. FAIM2 exhibited a significant attenuation of phenylephrine-induced enlargement of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, whereas FAIM2 knockdown aggravated the hypertrophic response. Furthermore, <i>Faim2</i> gene knockout significantly exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and heart fibrosis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations unveiled that FAIM2 exerts its inhibitory effect by suppressing TAK1-JNK1/2-p38 MAPK signaling cascades, thereby mitigating cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings position FAIM2 as a novel negative regulator of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through its inhibitory action on mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling activation. This identification of FAIM2's role provides crucial insights that may pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating pathological cardiac hypertrophy, addressing a critical need in cardiovascular disease management."

Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Thailand, the UK and the USA. Adults (N=145; mean age 39.9 years) with NTDT who were transfusion-free ≥8 weeks before randomisation. Score changes from baseline to weeks 13-24 in PROs used as anchors (correlation coefficient ≥0.3): NTDT-PRO T/W and SoB scores, Patient Global Impression of Severity, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (Fatigue Subscale, item HI12 and item An2) and Short Form Health Survey version 2. The eCDF curves support the use of estimates from the improvement by one level group for all anchors to determine the threshold(s) for meaningful within-patient improvement. Mean (median) changes from these groups and estimates from distribution-based analyses suggest that a ≥1-point reduction in the NTDT-PRO T/W or SoB domains represents a clinically meaningful improvement. Meaningful between-group difference threshold ranges were 0.53-1.10 for the T/W domain and 0.65-1.15 for the SoB domain. The optimal symptomatic threshold for the T/W domain (by maximum Youden's index) was ≥3 points.

    "abstract": "Metabolic requirements vary during development, and our understanding of how metabolic activity influences cell specialization is incomplete. Here, we describe a switch from glutamine catabolism to synthesis required for erythroid cell maturation. Glutamine synthetase (GS), one of the oldest functioning genes in evolution, is activated during erythroid maturation to detoxify ammonium generated from heme biosynthesis, which is up-regulated to support hemoglobin production. Loss of GS in mouse erythroid precursors caused ammonium accumulation and oxidative stress, impairing erythroid maturation and recovery from anemia. In β-thalassemia, GS activity is inhibited by protein oxidation, leading to glutamate and ammonium accumulation, whereas enhancing GS activity alleviates the metabolic and pathological defects. Our findings identify an evolutionarily conserved metabolic adaptation that could potentially be leveraged to treat common red blood cell disorders."

A total of 258 samples with 54 different β-thalassemia genotypes related to 32 mutations were gathered and evaluated. A library was constructed with the BTSeq<sup>TM</sup> kit and sequencing was performed on the Illumina NGS machine. The validation results showed 98.45% concordance with conventional genotypes. Less discordant results (1.55%) were limited to insertional mutations and included one case of each of the following: <i>HBB</i>:c.27dupG, <i>HBB</i>:c.85dupC, <i>HBB</i>:c.216dupT, and <i>HBB</i>:c.440_441dupAC. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms that derived from the NGS results were also analyzed in terms of allele frequency and revealed significant differences between the wild types and other β-genotypes. Furthermore, this paper is the first to describe rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms including IVS II-109 (C/T), IVS II-258 (G/A), IVS II-613 (T-C), and IVS II-806 (G/C). Interestingly, the C allele of IVS II-806 was found to have 100% linkage with two cases of Hb Tak. The haplotype and phylogenetic analysis was also constructed based on variants and revealed three clusters in the Hb variants, which represented their evolution and genetic background. Finally, NGS with the barcode-tagged method has a high throughput, which is suitable for large population screening. Its cost effectiveness and less complicated process promote its application in further works."

She received two transfusions of 2 units of negative crossmatched washed red blood cells (RBCs) each, but shortly after she experienced a transfusion reaction. Symptoms included chest tightness, dyspnea, chills, and soy sauce colored urine. A post-transfusion specimen was sent to the blood type reference laboratory (BTRL) for investigation, which revealed the presence of anti-Le<sup>a</sup> and anti-Le<sup>b</sup> antibodies causing the immediate acute hemolytic transfusion reaction; interestingly, the patient's Le<sup>a</sup> antibody was found to be IgM, while the Le<sup>b</sup> antibody was both IgM and IgG. This combination of antibodies is rare and highlights the potential for clinically insignificant Lewis cold antibodies to cause serious reactions. It is important to not overlook these antibodies and to select antigen-negative units rather than relying solely on blood crossmatching. The use of polybrene in crossmatching blood tests may have limitations in the presence of Lewis antibodies, so alternative methods should be considered in difficult cases to ensure safe and effective transfusions. This case emphasizes the need for thorough testing and careful selection of blood products to reduce the risk of transfusion reactions and improve overall transfusion safety."

    "title": "Utility of caregiver signaling questions to detect neurocognitive impairment in children with sickle cell disease.",
    "abstract": "The American Society of Hematology cerebrovascular guidelines for sickle cell disease (SCD) recommend surveillance using signaling questions to screen for neurocognitive difficulties, although the clinical utility of these signaling questions has yet to be established. This study aimed to determine the clinical utility of caregiver signaling questions for detecting significant neurocognitive impairment (defined as >1.5 standard deviation [SD] below the normative mean on ≥2 measures) and domain-specific impairment (defined as >1.5 SD below the normative mean) in children and adolescents with SCD. A total of 421 caregivers of children with SCD aged 8 to 17 years (62% hemoglobin SS (HbSS) or hemoglobin S-beta zero (HbSβ0) thalassemia) were asked 7 signaling questions. Children completed performance-based neurocognitive and academic measures. Children who were reported to have repeated a grade, did not obtain primarily A/B grades in school, had a history of learning difficulties, or whose caregiver reported concern for their learning were more likely to have significant neurocognitive impairment and obtained lower scores across all measures (all q < 0.05). History of learning difficulties emerged as the most sensitive and specific signaling question for detecting significant neurocognitive impairment (sensitivity, 0.64; specificity, 0.77) and domain-specific impairment (sensitivity range, 0.56-0.77; specificity range, 0.63-0.72). Cumulative caregiver report improved prediction of neurocognitive impairment beyond demographic/clinical factors alone. Although performance-based screening for all patients with SCD is the most effective means to identify those with neurocognitive or academic impairment, use of caregiver signaling questions represents a brief and low-cost method to improve the detection of patients with SCD in need of support."

    "abstract": "This study investigated the associations of the rs4671393, rs1427407, and rs11886868 genetic variants of the <i>BCL11A</i> gene and the rs9399137 variant of the <i>HBS1L-MYB</i> gene with thalassemia in patients from the population of Punjab, Pakistan. A cohort of 600 participants, comprising 300 patients with thalassemia and 300 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, was recruited from various hospitals in Punjab, Pakistan. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples from all participants. Specific DNA regions containing four genetic variants of interest were amplified with polymerase chain reaction. The genotypic frequencies of the rs4671393 SNP of <i>BCL11A</i> indicated that the heterozygous (AG) genotype of this SNP was significantly associated with a nearly two-fold increased thalassemia risk, with respect to the control group (OR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.77-2.80; p = 0.01). Combining all genotypes into a joint model further confirmed their significant association with thalassemia risk. Similarly to the findings for rs4671393, the heterozygous (CT) genotype of rs11886868 exhibited a significant association with thalassemia risk (approximately two-fold increased risk. Analysis of both genotypes together revealed a marginally significant association (one-fold increased risk) with thalassemia in individuals carrying any variant allele of rs11886868. The allelic distribution of the rs1427407 SNP of <i>BCL11A</i> indicated that the heterozygous (GT) genotype of this SNP was significantly associated with thalassemia (approximately two-fold increased risk, with respect to the control group). Combining all genotypes into a joint model confirmed a significant association between the presence of any variant allele of rs1427407 and thalassemia (two-fold increased risk). The genotypic distribution frequencies of the heterozygous (CT) genotype for the rs9399137 SNP of <i>HBS1L-MYB</i> was similar to that of rs1427407, and exhibited a highly significant association with thalassemia risk (nearly two-fold increased risk). Analysis of both genotypes together revealed a significant association with thalassemia risk (one-fold increase) for individuals carrying any variant allele of rs9399137. <i>BCL11A</i> and <i>HBS1L-MYB</i> polymorphisms were significantly associated with increased thalassemia risk."

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a definitive cure for eligible patients with thalassemia major, and calcineurin inhibitors are essential for preventing graft-versus-host disease. Although invaluable, there are few reports of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions associated with calcineurin inhibitors. These reactions are generally rare but seem to be more prevalent among patients with thalassemia. Herein, we retrospectively report four cases of patients with thalassemia major who developed hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral cyclosporine. The cases include one 19-year-old Caucasian female and three Caucasian males, aged 17, 10, and 20 years, respectively. The patients exhibited symptoms of varying severity, necessitating different management strategies. The reactions occurred either immediately or within a few minutes after the onset of cyclosporine infusion and were often worsened by rechallenge. In all cases, cyclosporine was eventually replaced with tacrolimus or sirolimus. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate the basis of severe immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to calcineurin inhibitors in patients with thalassemia major undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Several immunogenic factors may potentially increase the susceptibility of these patients to hypersensitivity reactions to Cremophor-containing medications. While severe reactions to calcineurin inhibitors remain rare, clinicians should be aware of the potential for serious adverse events in patients with thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Presentation of a novel case of a patient with Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis, which was accurately identified by SMRT sequencing leading to expand the mutation spectrum of α-thalassemia. A 26-year-old pregnant woman and her husband underwent molecular analysis of thalassemia due to abnormal hematological results. The molecular analysis showed that the pregnant woman carried -α<sup>3.7</sup>/--<sup>SEA</sup>, while her husband exhibited a negative result. Accordingly, the pregnant woman continued the pregnancy until the 19-week gestational age. She was subsequently referred to our department for genetic counseling due to abnormal ultrasound findings in the fetus. A novel deletional α-thal mutation was detected for the husband by MLPA, and the precise location of the mutation was determined through SMRT sequencing, which revealed a 45.2 kb deletion. Later, an interventional umbilical cord blood puncture was offered for the pregnant woman. The cord blood was subjected to capillary electrophoresis, which revealed apparent Hb Bart's and Hb Portland peaks associated with Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome. It is imperative that Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome be diagnosed with the utmost expediency. If results of molecular analysis are not consistent with the clinical hematological findings, the presence of a novel thalassemia could be suspected. To identify the novel genotype, the SMRT sequencing represents an effective method for achieving an accurate diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The differential diagnosis between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia trait (TT) remains a significant clinical challenge. This study aimed to develop a machine learning-based multi-class model to differentiate among Microcytic-TT(TT with low mean corpuscular volume), Normocytic-TT (TT with normal mean corpuscular volume), IDA, and healthy individuals. A comprehensive dataset comprising 1,819 individuals was analyzed using six distinct machine learning algorithms. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was ultimately selected to construct the MultiThal-Classifier (M-THAL) model. SMOTENC (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous features) was employed to address data imbalance. Model performance was evaluated using various metrics, and SHAP values were applied to interpret the model's predictions.Additionally, external validation was conducted to assess the model's robustness and generalizability. After performing 1000 bootstrap resamples of the test set, the average performance metrics of M-THAL and the 95 % confidence interval(CI) were as follows, sensitivity 90.27 % (95 % CI: 84.88-95.26), specificity 97.87 % (95% CI: 97.10-98.55), PPV 93.42 % (95 % CI: 89.34-96.48), NPV 97.82% (95 % CI: 97.00-98.53), F1-score 91.50 % (95% CI: 87.29-95.34), Youden's index 88.15 % (95 % CI: 82.33-93.70), accuracy 97.06 % (95% CI: 96.06-97.99), and AUC 94.07 % (95 % CI: 91.17-96.84).Feature importance analysis identified mean corpuscular volume(MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin(MCH), red cell distribution width - standard deviation(RDW-SD), and hemoglobin (HGB) were identified as the most important features. External validation confirmed the model's robustness and generalizability. The M-THAL effectively distinguishes Normocytic-TT, Microcytic-TT, IDA, and healthy individuals using hematological parameters, offers a rapid and cost-effective screening tool that can be readily implemented in diverse healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "Red blood cell (RBC) antigen matching beyond ABO and RhD is commonly recommended for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia. We present an updated systematic literature review to inform evidence-based guidelines on RBC matching. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was used to develop recommendations. Six new observational studies (4 prospective, 2 retrospective) were identified. The six studies reported on 583 patients in total, including cross-over designs, with sample sizes from 10 to 343. Studies were heterogeneous, utilising varying degrees of RBC matching and different definitions for 'extended' matching. All reported on alloimmunisation. One study reported on molecular matching. The reported prevalence of alloimmunisation using limited matching was 0%-50% and with extended matching was 0%-24%. Eighty-two patients were alloimmunised before study entry. The risk of bias across studies was moderate to critical. The guideline panel recommends that ABO, RhDCcEe, and K-compatible RBCs are selected for individuals with SCD and thalassaemia, even in the absence of alloantibodies, and that RBCs which are antigen-negative to already existing clinically significant antibodies are chosen. There is a need for comparative research to define the benefit, impact, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of extended RBC matching strategies to prevent alloimmunisation."

    "abstract": "To assess gonadal function in adolescent male patients with β-thalassemia who underwent earlier successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Fifty-two male patients with β-thalassemia, aged ≥10 years, who had undergone HSCT ≥2 years previously were included. Clinical data, such as age, genital Tanner (GT) stage at HSCT and enrollment, and serum ferritin levels, were collected. Gonadal function was evaluated through measurements of serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, inhibin B levels, and semen analysis. Age at enrollment and HSCT were 17 (10-31) and 9 (1-19) years, respectively. The duration from HSCT to enrollment was 7.5 (2-20) years. Of 52 patients, 46 (88%) exhibited Sertoli cell dysfunction. Thirty-one patients had relatively small testes for their GT stage, 34 of 44 with GT V had elevated FSH of ≥5 IU/L, and 20 of 49 with GT stages 2-5 had low serum inhibin B levels. None of the patients with GT stage 5 showed Leydig cell dysfunction or gonadotropin deficiency. Serum FSH ≥8 IU/L showed the best diagnostic accuracy for detecting oligo- and azoo-spermia. All 39 patients who underwent semen analysis had >1 abnormal parameters. Having relatively small testes for GT stage and serum FSH ≥8 IU/L were associated with oligospermia or azoospermia (p<0.01). Male patients with β-thalassemia after HSCT experienced universal impaired spermatogenesis and frequent Sertoli cell dysfunction but their Leydig cell function appeared to be preserved. Male patients and/or their guardians should be informed of the high likelihood of future subfertility before HSCT."

    "abstract": "The global prevalence of α-thalassemia necessitates effective newborn screening strategies due to its severe clinical consequences. Traditional methods such as liquid chromatography (LC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and isoelectric focusing (IEF) face limitations, including low separation efficiency, poor sensitivity for detecting Hb Bart's, and time-intensive operations, particularly with dried blood spots (DBS). These limitations hinder timely and accurate screening. This study addresses the need for a more efficient, sensitive, and rapid method for detecting Hb Bart's in newborns. We enhanced IEF separation and sensitivity by designing a microfluidic IEF (mIEF) system with shortened columns and employing a coelution sample loading technique using oil-sealed blood spots for rapid sample pretreatment. Our experiments demonstrated significant improvements: the total analysis time was reduced from 1110 min (IPG IEF) and 46 min (LC) per batch to 36 min per batch. For individual samples, the focusing time decreased from 6 min (previous mIEF) to 3 min, with the microcolumn length shortened by 50 %, from 30 mm to 15 mm. The developed method showed excellent consistency with clinical Bart's detection and PCR diagnosis, achieving 100 % sensitivity and 98 % specificity for α-thalassemia screening. Our novel mIEF method provides an efficient, sensitive, and rapid tool for screening newborns for α-thalassemia. This advancement addresses the limitations of traditional techniques, improving early diagnosis and intervention strategies and ultimately enhancing health outcomes for at-risk newborns."

NIHF refers specifically to cases where maternal antibodies against red blood cell antigens are excluded. Early identification of the underlying causes is essential for managing pregnancy and deciding on treatment. The prognosis depends on the causes, both in the short and long term. Each case should be considered individually. We describe a case of severe fetal hydrops first identified at 35 weeks of gestation. In this instance, a definitive diagnosis could not be reached during pregnancy.

While their complete pathophysiology remains unclear, factors such as changes in chorioallantoic membranes, placentitis, or fetal abnormalities may contribute. Hydrops present as a medical emergency that can cause complications for the mare. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the mare's prognosis, as fetal survival is often poor. This report describes a case of hydroallantois in a 9-year-old pregnant Quarter mare at 271 days of gestation, leading to dystocia of a non-viable foal with multiple congenital abnormalities. Given the poor prognosis for fetal survival, transcervical gradual fluid drainage and pregnancy termination were performed. The malformed fetus was subsequently delivered and humanely euthanized. Necropsy findings revealed a schistosomus fetus with palatoschisis, a wry nose, prognathism, and unilateral ovarian agenesia. The case underscores the importance of timely intervention in managing hydroallantois. The report contributes to understanding horses' clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of hydroallantois."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia (TDT) is a severe disease, resulting in lifelong blood transfusions, iron overload, and associated complications. Betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel) gene therapy uses autologous haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) transduced with BB305 lentiviral vector to enable transfusion independence. HGB-212 was a non-randomised, multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 3 study of beti-cel in patients with TDT conducted at eight centres in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the UK, and the USA. Patients with β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup>, β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>, or β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>/β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup> genotypes, clinically stable TDT, and a transfusion history of at least 100 mL/kg per year of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) or at least eight transfusions of pRBCs per year in the 2 years before enrolment were eligible for participation. After undergoing HSPC mobilisation and busulfan-based, pharmacokinetic-adjusted myeloablative conditioning, patients were infused with beti-cel and followed up for 24 months. The primary efficacy outcome was transfusion independence, defined as weighted average haemoglobin level of 9 g/dL or above without pRBC transfusions for 12 or more months. The primary outcome was measured in all patients who received an infusion of beti-cel (transplant population); safety was evaluated in all patients who initiated study treatment (intention-to-treat population). Patients were eligible to enrol in the ongoing 13-year long-term follow-up study (for a total of 15 years), LTF-303 (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02633943). This trial, HGB-212, was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03207009), and is complete. From June 8, 2017, to March 12, 2020, 20 patients were screened for eligibility. One patient was ineligible and one withdrew consent before HSPC mobilisation and myeloablative conditioning. Of the 18 patients who received beti-cel, ten (56%) were male and eight (44%) were female; 13 (72%) were younger than 18 years at the time of informed consent, and five (28%) were older than 18 years. 12 (67%) patients had β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> genotypes, three (17%) had β<sup>0</sup>/ β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>, and three (17%) had β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>/β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>. As of Jan 30, 2023, all patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study and the median follow-up was 47·9 months (range 23·8-59·0). All 18 patients were evaluable for transfusion independence, with 16 (89%) of 18 reaching and maintaining transfusion independence to last follow=up (estimated effect size 89·9% [95% CI 65·3-98·6]). All patients had at least one adverse event after beti-cel infusion. There were no serious adverse events considered to be related to beti-cel, and no deaths. These data demonstrate that beti-cel can allow patients with genotypes that cause severe β-thalassaemia (β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup>, β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>, or β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>/β<sup>+IVS-I-110</sup>) to reach transfusion independence. Beti-cel offers the potential to attain near-normal haemoglobin levels for those with severe forms of TDT, and a potentially curative option without the risks and limitations of allogeneic HSPC transplantation. Patients are being followed up for a total of 15 years to assess the durability of transfusion independence and long-term safety profile of beti-cel. Bluebird Bio, Somerville, MA, USA."

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and early diagnosis via gadolinium ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) significantly impacts patient outcomes. However, patient anxiety during MRI can affect image quality. This study investigates the impact of pre-examination video education on anxiety, satisfaction and image quality in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI. We prospectively enrolled 480 patients who underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI from January 2022 to May 2023 at our hospital. Patients were divided into study and control groups in order of odd and even days, with 240 cases in each group. Before the examination, the radiology staff provided routine verbal guidance and breathing training to the patients in the control group, while the study group was given additional video education. The state anxiety scores, satisfaction scores of the provided information and motion artefact scores of the images before and after the examination were compared between the two groups. The state anxiety scores of both groups of patients were lower than before the examination (all P < 0.05), but the change value of the study group was significantly greater than that of the control group (P = 0.004). The satisfaction rate of the information provided before the scan in the study group was significantly higher (P < 0.001). The image quality scores of the arterial phase were similar between the two groups (P = 0.403), but the image quality of the study group in the pre-contrast, portal phase, transitional phase and hepatobiliary phase was significantly better than that of the control group (all P < 0.05). Supplementing routine pre-scan care with video guidance for Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI offers several benefits, including reduced patient anxiety, increased satisfaction and improved image quality. These results suggest the potential for widespread application of video-based interventions to enhance the MRI experience for patients."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent <i>β</i>-thalassemia (TDT) is a hereditary blood disorder that often leads to complications affecting growth, nutritional status, and muscle mass in children. This study aims to investigate the associations between age, nutritional status, and muscle mass in children with TDT, providing insights into the progressive impact of age on these parameters. One hundred twenty-two children with TDT from March 2023 to March 2024 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Their nutritional status was assessed using the 2006-2007 World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Charts, and their muscle mass was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Data related to age, gender, weight, height, fat-free mass (FFM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and soft lean mass (SLM) of children were collected for comparative analysis from the hospital record room. Furthermore, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and regression analyses were utilized to investigate the associations between age and both nutritional status and muscle mass. The results of this study revealed negative correlations between age and wasting (<i>r</i> = -0.26, <i>p</i> < 0.001), stunting (<i>r</i> = -0.28, <i>p</i> < 0.001), FFM (<i>r</i> = -0.3, <i>p</i> < 0.001), SMM (<i>r</i> = -0.23, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and SLM (<i>r</i> = -0.36, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The regression analysis indicated that age was an independent predictor of wasting, stunting, and reduced muscle mass in these children (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). Our study observed a trend of worsening stunting, wasting, and muscle loss in children with TDT as they age. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring both nutritional and muscular health in TDT patients. Early detection and comprehensive nutritional management may improve outcomes in this population."

    "abstract": "Programmed silencing of γ-globin genes in adult erythropoiesis is mediated by several chromatin remodeling complexes, which determine the stage-specific genome architecture in this region. Identification of cis- or trans-acting mutations contributing to the diverse extent of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) might illustrate the underlying mechanism of γ-β-globin switching. Here, we recruit a cohort of 1142 β-thalassemia patients and dissect the natural variants in the whole β-globin gene cluster through a targeted next-generation sequencing panel. A previously unreported SNP rs7948668, predicted to disrupt the binding motif of IKAROS as a key component of chromatin remodeling complexes, is identified to be significantly associated with higher levels of Hb F and age at onset. Gene-editing on this SNP leads to the elevation of Hb F in both HUDEP-2 and primary CD34<sup>+</sup> cells while the extent of elevation is amplified in the context of β-thalassemia mutations, indicating epistasis effects of the SNP in the regulation of Hb F. Finally, we perform ChIP-qPCR and 4C assays to prove that this variant disrupts the binding motif of IKAROS, leading to enhanced competitiveness of HBG promoters to locus control regions. This study highlights the significance of common regulatory SNPs and provides potential targets for treating β-hemoglobinopathy."

    "abstract": "Congenital anemias include a broad range of disorders marked by inherent abnormalities in red blood cells. These abnormalities include enzymatic, membrane, and congenital defects in erythropoiesis, as well as hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. These conditions range in presentation from asymptomatic cases to those requiring frequent blood transfusions, exhibiting phenotypic heterogeneity and different degrees of severity. Despite understanding their different etiologies, all of them have a common pathophysiological origin with congenital defects of erythropoiesis. We can find different types, from congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA), which is a bone marrow failure anemia, to hemoglobinopathies as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, with a higher prevalence and clinical impact. Recent efforts have focused on understanding erythropoiesis dysfunction in these anemias but, so far, deep gene sequencing analysis comparing all of them has not been performed. Our study used Quant 3' mRNA-Sequencing to compare transcriptomic profiles of four sickle cell disease patients, ten thalassemia patients, and one rare case of SLC25A38 CSA. Our results showed clear differentiated gene map expressions in all of them with respect to healthy controls. Our study reveals that genes related to metabolic processes, membrane genes, and erythropoiesis are upregulated with respect to healthy controls in all pathologies studied except in the SLC25A38 CSA patient, who shows a unique gene expression pattern compared to the rest of the congenital anemias studied. Our analysis is the first that compares gene expression patterns across different congenital anemias to provide a broad spectrum of genes that could have clinical relevance in these pathologies."

    "title": "Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) Levels and F-Cell Numbers: A Systematic Review of Genome-Wide Association Studies.",
    "abstract": "Elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is partly controlled by genetic modifiers, ameliorates disease severity in β hemoglobinopathies. Understanding the genetic basis of this trait holds great promise for personalized therapeutic approaches. PubMed, MedRxiv, and the GWAS Catalog were searched up to May 2024 to identify eligible GWAS studies following PRISMA guidelines. Four independent reviewers screened, extracted, and synthesized data using narrative and descriptive methods. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Q-Genie tool. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on gene lists derived from the selected GWAS studies. Out of 113 initially screened studies, 62 underwent full-text review, and 16 met the inclusion criteria for quality assessment and data synthesis. A total of 939 significant SNP-trait associations (<i>p</i>-value < 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) were identified, mapping to 133 genes (23 with overlapping variant positions) and 103 intergenic sequences. Most SNP-trait associations converged around <i>BCL11A</i> (chr.2), <i>HBS1L-MYB</i>, (chr.6), olfactory receptor and beta globin (<i>HBB</i>) gene clusters (chr.11), with less frequent loci including <i>FHIT</i> (chr.3), <i>ALDH8A1</i>, <i>BACH2</i>, <i>RPS6KA2</i>, <i>SGK1</i> (chr.6), <i>JAZF1</i> (chr.7), <i>MMP26</i> (chr.11), <i>COCH</i> (chr.14), <i>ABCC1</i> (chr.16), <i>CTC1</i>, <i>PFAS</i> (chr.17), <i>GCDH</i>, <i>KLF1</i>, <i>NFIX</i>, and <i>ZBTB7A</i> (chr.19). Pathway analysis highlighted Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways related to olfaction, hemoglobin and haptoglobin binding, and oxygen carrier activity. This systematic review confirms established genetic modifiers of HbF level, while highlighting less frequently associated loci as promising areas for further research. Expanding research across ethnic populations is essential for advancing personalized therapies and enhancing outcomes for individuals with sickle cell disease or β-thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and the β-thalassemia trait (BTT) are two main causes of hypochromic-microcytic anemia worldwide. Researchers have described many red blood cell (RBC) indices as screening tests for presumptive differentiation, based on differences observed in complete blood count (CBC) data for each condition. There are few BTT reports in Chile, and neither laboratories nor clinical staff have widely used these indices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 29 RBC indices in 182 patients (51 BTT and 131 IDA) and compare CBC results in both groups. A retrospective search was carried out in the Laboratory Information System between January 2021 and February 2024 to collect results from CBC, and 29 RBC indices were calculated for each patient. Then, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, Youden's index, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated using MedCalc©. The Green and King, Wongprachum, and Keikhaei indices showed the best discriminatory power with Youden index values of 0.923, 0.908, and 0.896, respectively, and significant differences were observed in all CBC parameters between BTT and IDA patients (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The Green and King, Wongprachum, and Keikhaei indices showed the best performance; therefore, they can be used as screening for the differential diagnosis between BTT and IDA in order to improve diagnosis given the important therapeutic and epidemiological implications. In this way, clinical laboratories could have a main role in the investigation of these patients."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies represent the most commonly inherited autosomal recessive blood disorders in the world. The aim of this study was to determine the carrier frequency and molecular basis of hemoglobinopathies among blood donors in eastern Morocco. This is the first study of its kind for this country. Healthy blood donors of the BRO Biobank were included in this study. Blood samples were analyzed using an automatic blood cell analyzer for complete blood counts. Hemoglobin fractions were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and serum ferritin was measured on a chemical and immunological analyzer. Suspected hemoglobinopathy carriers were further characterized by Sanger sequencing, Gap PCR and PCR-RFLP. The study involved 2013 blood donors, of whom 1063 were male and 950 were female (sex ratio male-to-female of 1.1). The median age of these donors was 35 years. The overall carrier frequency of hemoglobinopathies was 1.84 %, with β-thalassemia carriers being the most prevalent (0.65 %) followed by HbAC (0.55 %), α-thalassemia carriers (0.30 %), HbAS (0.1 %), HbAG-Philadelphia (0.1 %), HbAD-Ouled Rabah (0.05 %) and HbAO-Arab (0.05 %). Additionally, novel β-thalassemia variants (C6(-G) and -83(A > G)) and a structural variant (Hb D-Ouled Rabah) were discovered for the first time in Morocco. This study provided the first report on carrier frequency and molecular basis of hemoglobinopathies among healthy donors in Morocco. These findings are valuable for the implementation of carrier screening and genetic diagnosis for hemoglobinopathies. Furthermore, these results justify the need to introduce pre-donation screening for hemoglobinopathy carriers in Morocco, particularly in areas with a high prevalence of carriers to enhance the overall quality of the national blood supply."

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 volunteer blood donors who met the national standard criterion of blood donation. Various tests were performed, including complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin, sickling test, G6PD assay, NESTROF test and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The prevalence of hematological abnormalities among blood donors reached 68.9%, with functional RBC abnormalities at 51.9%, leukopenia at 10.4%, thrombocytosis at 1.9%, and thrombocytopenia at 4.7%. Additionally, hemoglobinopathies were found in 21.7% of donors, with β-thalassemia trait at 3.8%, sickle cell trait at 1.9%, and suspected α-thalassemia trait at 16%, while G6PD deficiency and iron deficiency were present in 12.3% and 17.9% of donors, respectively. The NESTROF test, MCV and MCH demonstrated a sensitivity rate of 100%. MI and MCH exhibited the highest specificity followed by NESTROF test in the screening of β-thalassemia trait. The prevalence of hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency appear to be common among Yemeni blood donors. These results emphasize the necessity of comprehensive blood donation screening programs to safeguard the blood supply and promote early detection and management of hemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency in Yemen."

    "abstract": "Central nervous system tumors are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The most prevalent type of primary brain tumor is glioma. The exploration of significant genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional abnormalities has not only improved our understanding of glioma pathogenesis but has also revealed that these molecular alterations can serve as useful diagnostic markers for more precise classification and are linked to better treatment response and prognosis. Hence, incorporating molecular markers into routine tumor classification is a major priority in modern glioma diagnostics. The aim is to assess the mutation status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1, alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), and tumor protein 53 in glioma, and look for their association with various clinicopathological features. A single-center prospective cohort study, where all biopsies of glioma (January 2019 to July 2020) were evaluated, and immunohistochemistry was performed to assess the expression of IDH-1, ATRX, p53, and Ki-67 index. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS-24 software. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 123 consecutive cases of glioma. IDH-1 mutation was noted in 54 (43.9%) cases and these patients frequently presented with \"seizures\" (P = 0.006). The expression was maximum in World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2 tumors (65.4%) (P < 0.001), with the highest frequency in oligodendrogliomas (100% in WHO grade 2 and 3). Furthermore, these tumors showed lower proliferative indices (P = 0.001). ATRX mutation was noted in 59 (48%) and p53 overexpression was noted in 76 (61.8%) cases. These mutations were significantly associated with astrocytic phenotype (P = 0.03). Molecular characterization of glioma is an important step in modern glioma diagnostics and immunohistochemistry can play an important role. IDH-1 mutation is commonly observed in adults, frontal lobe location, patients presenting with seizures, and WHO grade 2 tumors with the highest frequencies in oligodendrogliomas. ATRX and p53 can be used as surrogate markers for tumors of astrocytic lineage."

In this study we aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Gazelle, a point-of-care (POC) testing device, in screening for BTT in hospital laboratory setting. Methods Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines were followed in developing study design, recruiting study participants and sample size calculation for the current research. A consecutive sample of 446 participants was recruited for this study and was tested for the reference test Gazelle as well as the gold standard cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (CE-HPLC). Low serum ferritin levels are known to interfere with the production of HbA2 and in turn lead to false negative results. Hence, the study population was divided into two categories with respect to a cut off value of 15ng/dl of serum ferritin and the results were analyzed. Results Overall diagnostic accuracy of Gazelle for detecting BTT was found to be 95.3 per cent with a confidence interval (CI) of (92.9 - 97.1) and the sensitivity was 94.5 per cent with a 95% CI of (84.8 - 98.8). When analyzed by the serum ferritin level the diagnostic accuracy was found to be 94.7 per cent (91.1% - 97.1%) and 95.7 per cent (91.8% - 98.1%) for participants with serum ferritin level as > 15 ng/ml and < 15 ng/ml, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions This study found Gazelle to be a good screening tool for β-thalassemia trait with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. However, it is recommended that the final confirmation of the diagnosis done by a diagnostic test like HPLC or Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE)."

    "abstract": "Β-thalassemia major (TM) patients underwent regular transfusions to prevent complications of chronic anemia. However, these regular transfusions result in progressive iron accumulation in vital organs, including the heart. Myocardial iron overload can lead to cardiac dysfunction and ultimately to heart failure. Diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction in β-TM patients is usually made through clinical examination, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), through the measurement of T2* relaxation time, represents the diagnostic modality of choice for assessing myocardial iron overload and guiding the iron chelation therapy. Despite a tailored chelation therapy reducing myocardial iron overload, heart failure remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality even in well-treated β-TM patients. Advances in CMR, including myocardial strain, parametric mapping (T1, T2, and extracellular volume), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) measurements, have expanded its role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and follow-up of these patients. This review seeks to offer a thorough overview of the potential uses of CMR in β-TM, extending beyond the established role of T2* measurement in guiding chelation therapy. It delves into the emerging applications of new CMR imaging biomarkers that could improve the overall management of β-TM patients."

    "abstract": "Inactivating mutations in chromatin modifiers, like the α-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked (ATRX)-death domain-associated protein (DAXX) chromatin remodeling/histone H3.3 deposition complex, drive the cancer-specific alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Prior studies revealed that HIRA, another histone H3.3 chaperone, compensates for ATRX-DAXX loss at telomeres to sustain ALT cancer cell survival. How HIRA rescues telomeres from the consequences of ATRX-DAXX deficiency remains unclear. Here, using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN), we establish that HIRA-mediated deposition of new H3.3 maintains telomeric chromatin accessibility to prevent the detrimental accumulation of nucleosome-free single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in ATRX-DAXX-deficient ALT cells. We show that the HIRA-UBN1/UBN2 complex deposits new H3.3 to prevent TERRA R-loop buildup and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs) at telomeres. Furthermore, HIRA-mediated H3.3 incorporation into telomeric chromatin links productive ALT to the phosphorylation of serine 31, an H3.3-specific amino acid, by Chk1. Therefore, we identify a critical role for HIRA-mediated H3.3 deposition that ensures the survival of ATRX-DAXX-deficient ALT cancer cells."

    "abstract": "A number of case reports have documented the occurrence of acute hepatic and renal toxicity during treatment with deferasirox (DFX). The precise mechanisms underlying these adverse events remain unclear, with the time to toxicity varying considerably between patients-some experiencing it within weeks of treatment initiation, while others after several years. Recent studies have underscored the association of pharmacogenetic variants in genes responsible for the metabolism and clearance of DFX (<i>ABCC2</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, and <i>UGT1A1</i>) in the development of toxicity. We present the case of an 8-year-old patient with beta thalassemia major who developed acute hepatic failure years after the initiation of DFX therapy. After ruling out the most likely causes, we performed a pharmacogenetic analysis, which suggested a possible link between the patient's genotype and the development of toxicity. Sanger sequencing was performed for the most extensively studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) studied associated with changes in transporter/enzyme function: <i>ABCC2</i> rs717620 (c.-24C>T), rs2273697 (c.1249G>A), rs8187710 (c.4544G>A), rs369192412 (g.99781071delG); <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231142 (c.421C>A); <i>UGT1A1 *6</i> rs4148323 (c.211G>A), <i>*28</i> rs3064744 (g.233760235TA[8]), <i>*36</i> rs3064744 (g.233760235TA[6]) and <i>*37</i> rs3064744 (g.233760235TA[9]). The patient is heterozygous for two <i>ABCC2</i> variants, namely rs717620 (c.-24C>T) and rs2273697 (c.1249G>A). These variants have the potential to cause a reduction in transporter function, which could in turn result in decreased drug clearance and increased toxicity. The precise mechanism by which toxicity developed in this case remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. However, it is probable that the presence of SNPs in the gene <i>ABCC2</i> played a substantial role. Our findings align with those of previously published reports of remarkably similar cases, where patients also exhibited genetic variants in the gene <i>ABCC2</i>."

Participants underwent assessments using subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale and a computerized task-switching paradigm with concurrent event-related potential (ERP) recordings, both before and after the treatment period. Assessments focused on processing speed, working memory, attention and executive function. ERP measurements targeted brain response changes during task switching. Memantine treatment enhanced cognitive test performance, especially in processing speed as shown by the Digit-Symbol Coding and Symbol-Search tests. Results indicated improved visuospatial and graphomotor speed, working memory and attention. The task-switching test revealed reduced error rates, suggesting decreased cognitive load and enhanced executive control. Electrophysiological changes in P1 and P3 amplitudes at frontal and parietal locations post-treatment pointed to more efficient neural processing in tasks requiring cognitive flexibility. These preliminary findings from a Phase II clinical study serve as a 'proof of concept', exploring the feasibility and potential effectiveness of memantine treatment in SCD-a previously uninvestigated context. They support the rationale for more extensive investigations to confirm these results and assess memantine's broader effectiveness."

Several studies have shown different results regarding the occurrence of kidney complications in thalassemia patients who received iron-chelating agents. In this study, we were looking for kidney complications by examining human NAG urine/serum and NGAL urine/serum in thalassemia community in East Java community. The study was conducted cross-sectionally in the thalassemia community in East Java with a total sample of 91 patients aged 13-48 years. All thalassemia patients filled in demographic data, transfusion routines, duration of taking iron chelating agents, and length of time diagnosed with thalassemia. Laboratory tests included routine blood tests for ferritin, ureum, serum creatinine, human NAG urine or serum, and human NGAL urine or serum. Comparison tests (<i>t</i>-test, Mann-Whitney, and ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis) were conducted to see if there were significant differences in the levels of human NAG urine and human NGAL urine serum based on age, sex, blood group, duration of transfusion, routine of transfusion, duration of taking iron chelating agents, and types of iron chelating drugs. Multivariate analysis was conducted to see whether some of these categories were related to abnormalities in human NAG urine or serum and human NGAL urine or serum. All 91 patients had normal creatinine values, yet some had abnormal serum NAG. There is a significant difference in urine human NAG and urine human NGAL levels at ages over 23 years (<i>p</i> = 0.05 and <i>p</i> = 0.01). Significant differences in human NGAL serum were also found in working and student patients (<i>p</i> = 0.028). Serum NGAL also differed in those taking deferasirox (<i>p</i> = 0.030) and significantly different human NGAL urine was also found in iron overload status (Ferritin ≥ 1000 ng.ml) (<i>p</i> = 0.006). There is no difference between human NAG urine/serum and human NGAL urine/serum based on sex, body mass index, blood type, hemoglobin less than 10 g/dl, routine transfusion once a month, duration of using iron chelation for more than 10 years, or splenomegaly status (splenomegaly, splenectomy, or no splenomegaly). The multivariate logistic regression results showed that age above 23 was a factor associated with abnormal urine human NAG levels (aOR = 3.79, 95% CI = 1.08-13.28). Students (aOR = 4.89, 95% CI = 1.48-16.16) with ages above 23 years (aOR = 3.69, 95% CI = 1.09-12.43) showed higher risk for an abnormal serum human NGAL levels. Patients with beta-thalassemia major exhibit noticeable tubular damage. Further research is encouraged to determine other factors behind tubular damage in the thalassemia community, particularly in Indonesia."

Gene editing has the potential to be a powerful tool for the treatment of human diseases including HIV, β-thalassemias, and sickle cell disease. Recent advances have begun to overcome one of the major limiting factors of this technology, namely delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing machinery, by utilizing viral vectors. However, gene editing therapies have yet to be implemented due to inherent risks associated with the DNA viral vectors typically used for delivery. As an alternative strategy, we have developed an RNA-based Sendai virus CRISPR-Cas9 delivery vector that does not integrate into the genome, is temperature sensitive, and does not induce a significant host interferon response. This recombinant SeV successfully delivered CRISPR-Cas9 in primary human CD14+ monocytes <i>ex vivo</i> resulting in a high level of CCR5 editing and inhibition of HIV infection."

    "abstract": "In this article, we present two cases of severe fetal hemolytic anemia based on a beta-thalassaemia trait inherited from a single parent. These cases, presented at 20 and 28 weeks' gestation, necessitated intra-uterine blood transfusions. This occurrence is remarkable because it challenges the common assumption that beta-thalassaemia typically has no prenatal implications regarding fetal anemia. Both fetuses inherited a rare heterozygous mutation from their mother, resulting in gamma-thalassaemia-related anemia. In the first case, the anemia was related to a deletion in the beta locus control region (βLCR) and in the second case, a deletion on chromosome 11p15.4 was the cause. These mutations not only affect the beta chain production, but also the gamma chain production, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of HbF, ineffective erythropoiesis and consequently, perinatal hemolytic anemia. Clinicians should be vigilant regarding these rare mutations in families with a history of beta-thalassaemia as the fetal clinical consequences can be severe and intra-uterine blood transfusions may prove life-saving for these fetuses."

Included patients had a diagnosis of β-thalassemia prior to the index date, ≥8 RBCTs per year for ≥2 consecutive years, and ≥1 year of follow-up data available from the index date. Each eligible patient was exact matched with up to 5 controls in the CPRD. Proportions of deaths and rates of mortality, acute and chronic complications, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) were calculated during the follow-up period. Of 11,359 identified patients with β-thalassemia, 237 patients with TDT met the eligibility criteria and were matched with 1184 controls. The mean age at the index date was approximately 25 years in the patient and control groups. The proportion of deaths (7.17% vs 1.18%; P < 0.05) and mortality rate (1.19 deaths per 100 person-years vs 0.20 deaths per 100 person-years) were higher among patients with TDT compared to controls. Endocrine complications and bone disorders were the most prevalent complications among patients with TDT (58.23%) and included osteoporosis (29.11%), diabetes mellitus (28.27%), and hypopituitarism (28.27%). Patients with TDT had a mean of 13.62 RBCTs per patient per year (PPPY). HCRU was substantially higher among patients with TDT, wherein patients with TDT had higher rates of prescriptions recorded in primary care (24.09 vs 8.61 PPPY), outpatient visits (16.69 vs 1.31 PPPY), and inpatient hospitalizations (17.41 vs 0.24 PPPY) than controls. Inpatient hospitalizations were primarily <1 day, with 16.62 events PPPY lasting <1 day and 0.79 events PPPY lasting ≥1 day. Patients with TDT aged ≥18 years had increased rates of mortality, clinical complications, and HCRU than those aged <18 years. Patients with TDT in England have higher mortality than matched controls, substantial disease-related clinical complications, and substantial HCRU. High mortality and clinical complications highlight the need for additional innovative therapies for TDT."

    "title": "Hemoglobinopathies in the Neonate.",
    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies in neonates constitute a group of disorders influenced by genetic mutations in the human globin genes. They are often broadly categorized into quantitative defects or qualitative defects, though they are not mutually exclusive. In quantitative defects, the mutation causes insufficient production of a normal globin chain, which can range from no production to mild deficiency. These are typically referred to as thalassemias. In qualitative defects, the structure of the hemoglobin is altered. The most common structural hemoglobinopathy is sickle cell disease. During fetal development, distinct globin chains are synthesized, which undergo a progressive switch to adult globin chains perinatally. This affects the timing of the clinical presentation of these disorders and thus, our ability to diagnose them. In this review, we focus on the epidemiology, genetic causes, clinical presentation, and general overview and management of common hemoglobin disorders that may be encountered in the neonatal period."

Data were limited when comparing clinical phenotypes between these two patient groups. We conducted a Thai multicentre study and enrolled 588 patients [median (IQR) age 13.0 (6.7-20.3) years], including those with deletional HbH disease with (n = 47) and without (n = 187) co-inherited HbE mutation and non-deletional HbH disease with (n = 101) and without (n = 253) co-inherited HbE mutation. Patients with HbH disease with co-inherited HbE mutation suffered more severe manifestations than those without. This observation was more pronounced in patients with non-deletional HbH disease. A greater proportion of patients with non-deletional HbH disease with co-inherited HbE mutation (43.6%) eventually required regular transfusions compared to those without (30.4%, p = 0.019). Among those with non-deletional HbH disease who did not require regular transfusions, Hb levels were lower in patients with co-inherited HbE mutation [8.1 (7.2-8.6) vs. 8.8 (8.2-9.5) g/dL, p < 0.001]. Among patients requiring regular transfusions who underwent splenectomy, 11/12 patients with non-deletional HbH disease stopped transfusion compared with 1/3 in non-deletional HbH disease with co-inherited HbE mutation group (p = 0.024). These findings provide insights for the clinical monitoring and management of HbH disease in the region."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by reduced hemoglobin production, leading to chronic anemia. A major complication of thalassemia is iron overload, primarily due to regular blood transfusions and increased gastrointestinal iron absorption, which can lead to iron overload cardiomyopathy, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in thalassemia patients. This review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying iron overload cardiomyopathy in thalassemia, examining how excessive iron accumulation disrupts cardiac function through oxidative stress, cellular damage, and altered calcium homeostasis. Clinical manifestations, including fatigue, arrhythmias, and heart failure, are discussed alongside diagnostic strategies such as echocardiography and cardiac MRI for early detection and monitoring. Management approaches focusing on iron chelation therapy, lifestyle modifications, and advanced interventions like gene therapy are explored. The review also highlights the importance of early diagnosis, regular monitoring, and patient adherence to therapy to prevent the progression of cardiomyopathy. Recent advances in treatment and future research directions, including personalized medicine, and gene editing technologies, are presented. Addressing the challenges in managing iron overload in thalassemia patients is crucial for improving outcomes and enhancing quality of life."

We analyzed patients with intermediate and severe β-thalassemia treated at our hospital from February 2019 to February 2024. Patients who received treatment for more than 3 months were included. The efficacy of thalidomide was assessed by comparing changes in hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, bilirubin, and Hb electrophoresis before and after treatment. Adverse drug reactions during treatment were also recorded. A total of 42 β-thalassemia patients were included, with thalidomide dosages ranging from 75 to 150 mg/d. The response rates at 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment were 73.8% (31/42), 75.0% (24/32), and 94.7% (18/19), respectively. The increase in Hb levels was primarily attributed to fetal hemoglobin (HbF). After 1 month of treatment, the HbF percentage increased from a baseline of 34.04 ± 27.58% to 56.25 ± 28.40% (P < .001). At 3 and 6 months, HbF further increased to 67.21 ± 27.12% (P < .001) and 73.93 ± 22.96% (P < .001), respectively. The average duration of thalidomide treatment was 25.3 ± 9.2 months (range: 4-60 months), with 6 patients treated for over 60 months and 18 patients for over 48 months. Two homozygous patients who failed thalidomide treatment achieved Hb levels above 100 g/L and discontinued transfusion therapy after 3 months of hydroxyurea treatment. The most common adverse reaction was somnolence, which was mild and tolerable. Thalidomide demonstrates significant and sustained therapeutic effects in β-thalassemia patients. The adverse reactions are mild and tolerable, allowing patients to continue treatment."

Previous studies revealed a link between the unfolded protein response (UPR) and miRNAs with acquired drug resistance. This study aimed to determine the expression profile of XBP1, hsa-miR-34c-5p, hsa-miR-214, and hsa-miR-30c-2* in resistant and sensitive multiple myeloma cell lines to a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. After establishing bortezomib-resistant cells, the expression level of XBP1, hsa-miR-214, hsa-miR-34c-5p, and hsa-miR-30c-2* in both cell lines were assessed by qRT-PCR. Hsa-miR-34c-5p was suppressed to study its effect on the expression profile of Bax/Bcl-2. Statistical analysis was done by t-test in two clinically resistant and sensitive cells to bortezomib. MTT assay confirmed the creation of the resistant cell line. The qRT-PCR screening showed a significant difference between XBP1 and miR-34c-5p levels in resistant and sensitive cells. Following hsa-miR-34c-5p blockage, while Bax was overexpressed, Bcl-2 expression was reduced in the resistant cell line, overcoming cells resistant to bortezomib. Our findings demonstrate miR-34c-5p is differentially expressed between bortezomib-sensitive and -resistant MM cells. Inhibiting miR-34c-5p re-sensitized resistant cells to bortezomib by modulating Bax/Bcl-2 expression, suggesting this miRNA regulates apoptosis and drug resistance and may be a promising therapeutic target for overcoming proteasome inhibitor resistance in MM."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) is a severe inherited disorder. Without regular treatment, patients with TDT experience complications that can significantly shorten life expectancy and severely impact both their quality of life and that of their families. The condition has attracted significant attention in global health discussions. Due to the challenges of blood supply shortages, the high costs of iron chelation therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), TDT presents a serious health risk to patients and imposes a substantial burden on families and society. However, research on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of thalassemia patients in China remains limited. This study evaluated the factors affecting the HRQoL of these patients, with the goal of developing strategies to improve their quality of life. In this cross-sectional study, children with TDT were recruited from five treatment centers in Guangxi, a province with a high prevalence of thalassemia in China. Structured questionnaires were employed to gather relevant data on sociodemographic variables, disease characteristics, treatments, and associated costs. The HRQoL was assessed using the Transfusion-Dependent Quality of Life (TranQoL) questionnaire, with a proxy version for patients aged 0-11 years and a child version for those aged 12-18 years. The study included 418 participants, yielding an overall TranQoL score of 60.6 ± 16.3 among thalassemia patients. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a negative correlation (P < 0.05) between overall TranQoL scores and several factors: increasing patient age, the presence of multiple thalassemia patients within a family, and undergoing HSCT. Conversely, adherence to regular treatment was positively correlated with higher TranQoL scores (P < 0.05). The study demonstrates that HRQoL among Chinese patients with TDT is at a low level. Age, treatment adherence, family support, and socioeconomic status were identified as key determinants influencing HRQoL. It is essential to further enhance and optimize health insurance policies and medical services to support comprehensive treatment strategies for these patients."

Patients with TDT had ≥ 1 iron chelation treatment, ≥ 8 red blood cell transfusions (RBCTs) during any 12-month period, and ≥ 12 months of available data pre- and post-index (i.e., first RBCT claim). Patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs had ≥ 2 VOCs/year in ≥ 2 consecutive years and ≥ 12 months of available data pre- and post-index (second VOC claim in the second of 2 consecutive years). Patients were propensity score matched to five controls by age, sex, geographic area, and index year. Clinical and HCRU outcomes were evaluated post-index. In total, 214 patients with TDT and 111 patients with SCD with recurrent VOCs were matched to 1070 and 555 controls, respectively. Both patient groups had substantially higher mortality rates than controls (TDT: 4.8 versus 0.8 deaths per 100 person-years; SCD: 1.6 versus 0.4 deaths per 100 person-years). Clinical complications were prevalent in both patient groups. Compared with controls, both patient groups had significantly higher mean rates of all-cause hospitalizations (TDT: 1.4 versus 0.1; SCD: 2.0 versus 0.1) and outpatient services (TDT: 21.9 versus 1.6; SCD: 6.2 versus 1.0) per patient per year (all: p < 0.05). Management of TDT and SCD in Italy is associated with significant clinical and health system burden, highlighting the need for new treatments that eliminate RBCTs and VOCs."

The prevalence of cancer is higher in IEI patients compared to the immunocompetent population and cancers are considered as an important and common cause of death in IEI patients. To systematically review demographic, genetic and cancer-related data of IEI patients with a history of malignancy. Moreover, we performed a meta-analysis aiming to determine the frequency of cancer in patients with different types of IEI. We conducted electronic searches on Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus (until September 2023) introducing terms related to IEI and cancer. Studies with human subjects with confirmed IEI who had developed at least one malignancy during their lifetime were included. A total number of 4607 IEI patients with a cancer history were included in the present study. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) had the highest number of reported cases (1284 cases), mainly due to a higher relative proportion of patients with predominantly antibody deficiencies (PAD) and their increased life expectancy contributing to the higher detection and reporting of cancers among these patients. The most common malignancy was hematologic/blood cancers (3026 cases, mainly diffuse large B cell lymphoma). A total number of 1173 cases (55.6%) succumbed to cancer, with the highest rate of bone marrow failure (64.9%). Among the patients with monogenic defects in IEI-associated genes, the majority of cases had ATM deficiency (926 cases), but the highest cancer frequency rate belonged to NBS1 deficiency (50.5%). 1928 cases out of total 4607 eligible cases had detailed data to allow further statistical analysis that revealed BRCA2 deficiency had the earliest cancer development (~ 38 months), lowest cure frequency, and highest fatality rate (85%), while ATM deficiency had the lowest cure frequency and highest fatality rate (72%) among total cases reviewed with exclusion of Fanconi anemia. The overall reported cancer frequency in the cases reviewed with and without exclusion of Fanconi anemia was 11.1% (95% confidence interval: 9.8-12.5%) and 12.0% (95% confidence interval: 10.6-13.5%), respectively. Our study revealed that the incidence of cancer is significantly dependent on the molecular and pathway defects in IEI patients, and individualized early screening and appropriate treatment, might improve the prognosis of these patients."

In the case of thalassemia, a cure is not currently accessible, and lifelong treatment is required. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is considered a crucial health outcome. This study aims to assess the HRQoL of children and adolescents with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) and compare it with that of beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) and healthy subjects. This case-control study included 88 patients with NTDT and 153 age- and gender-matched healthy children and adolescents. In addition, we included 70 registered patients with β-TM. We used the short-form health survey questionnaire to assess HRQoL. Of the 88 patients, 41 were diagnosed with alpha-thalassemia intermedia (α-TI; hemoglobin H disease), and 47 were with beta-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI). HRQoL domains were significantly higher in healthy children and adolescents compared to NTDT patients (P<0.001); the role emotion domain was the most affected in NTDT patients (51.92 ± 3.37), followed by general health (52.72 ± 3.05) and role physical (53.59 ± 3.13). α-TI patients had significantly higher HRQoL domains than patients with β-TI. The study also indicated that NTDT patients had significantly better QoL scores compared to β-TM patients (P<0.001) across all domains. NTDT patients have a lower HRQoL compared to healthy controls. However, their HRQoL scores are significantly better than those of patients with β-TM. Among NTDT patients, those with α-TI have significantly better HRQoL scores compared to patients with β-TI."

Children with beta thalassemia disease have several mutations. Prevention and premarital examination are still the most effective measures to lessen the burden of beta thalassemia. This study primarily aimed to determine the beta thalassemia carriers in relatives of beta thalassemia major children, the role of gene study in the confirmation of beta thalassemia trait diagnosis, and to detect the genetic defect in the relatives of beta thalassemia major children. The cross-sectional study was conducted on 109 healthy children, aged between six months and 18 years, who were the relatives (second and fourth degree) of beta thalassemia major cases. Gene screening, using the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), covered the most common 22 alleles in the Mediterranean region, and was successful in detecting 61.5% of beta-globin chain mutations of studied participants, in addition to high prevalence (34.8%) of beta thalassemia carriers among the relatives of beta thalassemia children. The beta thalassemia carrier rate was found to be highly prevalent among relatives of beta thalassemia major children. Despite the accuracy of gene screening in the detection of beta thalassemia carriers, the use of the most common 22 alleles can only detect 61.5% of carriers; hence, the value of tested gene study is still limited in the detection of carrier rates."

    "title": "A Rare Case of Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Carcinoma in Transfusion-dependent Thalassemia Patient: Clinical Presentation, Management, and Implications.",
    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is often accompanied by complications related to iron overload and the development of malignant solid tumors or hematological malignancies. The occurrence of Neuroendocrine carcinoma, specifically in the respiratory tract, is very rare, with a prevalence of approximately 25%. Therefore, this study presented a case of a 42-year-old male with a beta-thalassemia major at 28 years, complaining of shortness of breath. This case was reported due to its rarity in providing information about solid tumors in thalassemia patients. The physical examination revealed several symptoms, including tachycardia, tachypnea, anemia, icteric sclera, elevated jugular venous pressure, coarse wet Ronchi in the medial to basal areas of both lungs, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly (Schuffner 4). The patient regularly received blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy. A thoracic CT scan showed a lung mass and a biopsy of the mass revealed Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Carcinoma with high-grade proliferation and, large cell type. The patient also passed through cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy for 6 cycles every 21 days. There is almost no data on pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma in thalassemia patients, so it is hoped that this case report can provide information about malignant solid tumors that can occur in thalassemia patients."

    "abstract": "We present a never-transfused girl with thalassemia intermedia who was admitted for febrile aplastic crisis due to human parvovirus B19. After a first transfusion of packed red blood cells, she developed pulmonary oedema. She improved with supportive care including the use of intravenous diuretics. Due to severe anaemia, she received a second blood transfusion, antibiotics for febrile neutropenia and intravenous γ globulin for control of the parvovirus infection. She had an uneventful recovery. The first of her male blood donors had an antibody against a patient's human leukocyte antigens type II antigen with a high mean fluorescent intensity. Our patient had clinical features and supportive laboratory evidence for mild transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). However, she also met the criteria for transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). We conclude that our patient likely suffered from TRALI/TACO, a consensus term proposed in 2019 for patients in whom TRALI cannot be distinguished from TACO or in whom both conditions occur simultaneously."

    "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Adrenal insufficiency (AI) can be a significant concern in patients with transfusion-dependent homozygous beta thalassemia (bThal) due to the chronic disease burden and frequent blood transfusions that these patients require. The prevalence of AI in this population remains unclear, with studies often lacking control groups for comparison. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the proportion of patients with transfusion-dependent bThal who exhibit evidence of AI. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines identified 19 studies for analysis. <i>Results</i>: Despite the variability in the diagnostic methods used to ascertain AI, the meta-analysis revealed that approximately one-third of patients had evidence of AI, with the prevalence rising to 50% in studies focused on adults with bThal. <i>Conclusions</i>: These findings suggest an increased risk of AI in patients with bThal compared to the general population. Clinicians should consider tailored management strategies, including glucocorticoid coverage during surgical procedures, to mitigate the risk of adrenal crises in this vulnerable patient group. Further research is needed to optimize adrenal surveillance and management in patients with bThal."

    "abstract": "Myeloid sarcoma (MS), an extramedullary form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare tumor mass of myeloid blasts. It can disseminate to any one or multiple anatomical sites, with (synchronous MS) or without (isolated MS) bone marrow (BM) involvement. The aim of this review is to describe the most recent advances in MS regarding diagnosis, molecular background, various clinical manifestations from several organs, and treatment approaches. Due to the lack of prospective, randomized clinical trials, therapeutic decisions are a challenge for the clinician. In the era of novel targeted AML treatments, a critical analysis of how to decide the best option for individual patients, also covering the possible central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis is provided. For the majority of the patients, AML induction chemotherapy, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is generally recommended. This paper discusses the role of radiotherapy, the treatment of refractory and relapsed disease, along with the therapeutic approach of difficult-to-treat patients, due to specific problems related to different anatomical sites of MS."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin H/Constant Spring (Hb H/CS) disease represents a form of non-deletional Hb H disease characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia that ranges from moderate to severe and may lead to transfusion-dependent thalassemia. To study the underlying mechanisms of this disease, we conducted an analysis of erythropoiesis and gene expression in erythroid progenitor cells derived from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from patients with Hb H/CS disease and normal controls. Twelve patients with Hb H/CS disease and five normal controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples were collected to isolate CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells for the analysis of cell proliferation and differentiation. Six samples from patients with Hb H/CS disease and three controls were subsequently studied for gene expression by next generation sequencing analysis. Erythroid progenitor cells derived from patients with Hb H/CS disease exhibited a trend towards increased rates of erythroid proliferation and decreased cell viability compared to those from controls. Moreover, erythroid progenitor cells derived from patients with Hb H/CS disease demonstrated delayed terminal differentiation. Gene expression profiling revealed elevated levels of genes encoding molecular chaperones, including the heat shock protein genes (<i>HSP</i>s) and the chaperonin containing TCP-1 subunit genes (<i>CCT</i>s) in the Hb H/CS disease group. In summary, erythroid progenitor cells derived from patients with Hb H/CS disease exhibit a trend towards heightened erythroid proliferation, diminished cell viability, and delayed terminal differentiation. Additionally, the increased expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones was observed, providing information on potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."

    "title": "Impact of met-haemoglobin and oxidative stress on endothelial function in patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Transfusion dependent β-thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by chronic anaemia. Blood transfusion is lifesaving but comes at a cost. Iron overload emerges as a prime culprit as a free radicals damage endothelial cells. Chronic anaemia further disrupts oxygen delivery, exacerbating the oxidative stress. Increased levels of met-haemoglobin and malondialdehyde compromise endothelial function. This research sheds light on the impact of met-haemoglobin and oxidative stress on endothelial function in 50 patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia major compared to 50 healthy individuals as control. Blood samples were collected & subjected to CBC, biochemical analysis including creatinine, ferritin, CRP, LDH, and HCV antibodies. Oxidative stress was assessed using met-haemoglobin & malondialdehyde. Endothelial dysfunction was evaluated by endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX). EASIX, met-haemoglobin and malondialdehyde were significantly increased in patients (1.44 ± 0.75, 2.07 ± 0.2, 4.8 ± 0.63; respectively) compared to the control (0.52 ± 0.24,0.88 ± 0.34,0.8 ± 0.34; respectively). Significant strong positive correlation was found between EASIX and met-haemoglobin, malondialdehyde, serum ferritin and CRP (P = 0.00, r = 0.904, P = 0.00, r = 0.948, P = 0.00, r = 0.772, P = 0.00, r = 0.971; respectively. Met-haemoglobin as well as EASIX should be routinely estimated to assess endothelial function especially before the decision of splenectomy. Antioxidant drugs should be supplemented."

    "title": "Increased Cadmium Load, Vitamin D Deficiency, and Elevated FGF23 Levels as Pathophysiological Factors Potentially Linked to the Onset of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: A Review.",
    "abstract": "The preventability of acute lymphocytic leukemia during childhood is currently receiving great attention, as it is one of the most common cancers in children. Among the known risk factors so far are those affecting the development of gut microbiota, such as a short duration or absence of breastfeeding, cesarean section, a diet lacking in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the use of antibiotics, absence of infection during infancy, and lack of pets, among other factors. Namely, it has been shown that iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and lack of vitamin D may cause intestinal dysbiosis, while at the same time, both increase the risk of hematological malignancies. The presence of IDA and vitamin D deficiency have been shown to lead to a decreased proportion of Firmicutes in stool, which could, as a consequence, lead to a deficit of butyrate. Moreover, children with IDA have increased blood concentrations of cadmium, which induces systemic inflammation and is linked to the onset of an inflammatory microenvironment in the bone marrow. Finally, IDA and Cd exposure increase fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) blood levels, which in turn suppresses vitamin D synthesis. A lack of vitamin D has been associated with a higher risk of ALL onset. In brief, as presented in this review, there are three independent ways in which IDA increases the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) appearance. These are: intestinal dysbiosis, disruption of vitamin D synthesis, and an increased Cd load, which has been linked to systemic inflammation. All of the aforementioned factors could generate the appearance of a second mutation, such as ETV6/RUNX1 (TEL-AML), leading to mutation homozygosity and the onset of disease. ALL has been observed in both IDA and thalassemia. However, as IDA is the most common type of anemia and the majority of published data pertains to it, we will focus on IDA in this review."

    "title": "Upregulation of miR‑6747‑3p affects red blood cell lineage development and induces fetal hemoglobin expression by targeting BCL11A in β‑thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "In β‑thalassemia, excessive α‑globin chain impedes the normal development of red blood cells resulting in anemia. Numerous miRNAs, including miR‑6747‑3p, are aberrantly expressed in β‑thalassemia major (β‑TM), but there are no reports on the mechanism of miR‑6747‑3p in regulating red blood cell lineage development and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression. In the present study, RT‑qPCR was utilized to confirm miR‑6747‑3p expression in patients with β‑TM and the healthy controls. Electrotransfection was employed to introduce the miR‑6747‑3p mimic and inhibitor in both HUDEP‑2 and K562 cells, and red blood cell lineage development was evaluated by CCK‑8 assay, flow cytometry, Wright‑Giemsa staining and Benzidine blue staining. B‑cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) was selected as a candidate target gene of miR‑6747‑3p for further validation through FISH assay, dual luciferase assay and Western blotting. The results indicated that miR‑6747‑3p expression was notably higher in patients with β‑TM compared with healthy controls and was positively related to HbF levels. Functionally, miR‑6747‑3p overexpression resulted in the hindrance of cell proliferation, promotion of cell apoptosis, facilitation of cellular erythroid differentiation and γ‑globin expression in HUDEP‑2 and K562 cells. Mechanistically, miR‑6747‑3p could specifically bind to the 546‑552 loci of BCL11A 3'‑UTR and induce γ‑globin expression. These data indicate that upregulation of miR‑6747‑3p affects red blood cell lineage development and induces HbF expression by targeting BCL11A in β‑thalassemia, highlighting miR‑6747‑3p as a potential molecular target for β‑thalassemia therapy."

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism of hyperammonemia is thought to be multifactorial, but is not yet fully understood. No studies have yet reported hyperammonemia combined with Fanconi syndrome caused by deferasirox. A 10-year-old girl was admitted for vomiting and altered consciousness. Blood testing revealed hyperammonemia and normal liver and coagulation functions. During hospitalization, the patient also exhibited hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypophosphatemia. Additionally, urinalysis revealed glucose and protein levels clinically consistent with Fanconi syndrome. The patient had a history of severe beta-thalassemia and had received intermittent blood transfusions for approximately ten years. The patient had been administered oral deferasirox at a 400 mg/day dose at the age of four, which had been gradually increased to the current 750 mg/day dosage. Upon admission, deferasirox was discontinued and treatment including mechanical ventilation, continuous blood purification therapy for ammonia reduction and acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance corrections was administered. Subsequently, serological markers returned to normal, urine test findings improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of hyperammonemia with Fanconi syndrome owing to deferasirox. For effective management and long-term follow-up of chronic diseases in children, pediatricians must master standardized treatments and the adverse reactions of various drugs. When symptoms are difficult to explain clinically, we must trace the source and adjust the treatment plan to maximize improving the patient's prognosis."

    "abstract": "Beta thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that results in inefficient erythropoiesis due to genetic mutation that leads to the reduction or absence of the hemoglobin beta-globulin protein. Approximately 8.5% of UAE residents suffer from β-thalassemia, a significant health and financial problem. The treatment options available for β-Thalassemia major are limited and associated with a wide range of complications. β-thalassemia gene therapy is emerging as a potential novel treatment option that eliminates the complications caused by the current long-term treatment modalities and the associated economic burden. This paper reviews the scientific literature related to emerging gene therapy for β-Thalassemia by analyzing all the articles published from January 2010 to December 2023 in the English language on Databases like PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, and CINAHL. The use of gene therapy has demonstrated promising outcomes for a permanent cure of β-Thalassemia. To conclude, gene therapy is an innovative solution. It demonstrates a promising future, but does come with its own setbacks and is something that must be tackled in order to revolutionize it in the medical world. FDA-approved ZYNTEGLO is a potentially one-time curative treatment for β-Thalassemia. Although cutting-edge, its use is limited because of the high cost-a price of USD 2.8 million per patient."

    "abstract": "Renal tubular dysfunction is common in transfusion-dependent β thalassemia (β-TM). Iron overload, chronic anemia, and hypoxia are precipitating factors for renal insult. However, gut microbiota engagement in the renal insult has not been explored. Our work aimed to assess the potential link between iron overload, gut leakage/dysbiosis, and kidney dysfunction in these children. We enrolled 40 children with β-TM and 40 healthy controls. Gut leakage/dysbiosis biomarkers (trimethylamine-N-oxide [TMAO] and fecal short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs]), oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, TMAO-regulated proteins such as serum sirtuin 1 (S.SIRT1) and serum high mobility box group-1 (S.HMGB1), and tubular dysfunction biomarkers were assessed. Correlations and regression analysis were performed to assess the relation between different parameters. Iron overload, redox imbalance, and generalized inflammation were evident in children with β-TM. Renal tubular dysfunction biomarkers and S.TMAO were significantly elevated in the patient group. Furthermore, fecal SCFAs were significantly lower with upregulation of the investigated genes in the patient group. The correlation studies affirmed the close relationship between circulating ferritin, TMAO, and renal dysfunction and strongly implicated SIRT1/HMGB1 axis in TMAO action. Gut dysbiosis may have a role in the pathogenesis of renal injury in children with β-TM. Renal tubular dysfunction is a prominent health issue in β thalassemia major (β-TM). Iron overload, chronic anemia, and hypoxia are known precipitating factors. However, gut microbiota engagement in renal insult in these patients has not yet been explored. We aimed to assess potential link between iron overload, gut leakage/dysbiosis, and kidney dysfunction in β-TM children and to highlight the SIRT1/HMGB1 axis, a signal motivated by the gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), involvement in such insults. We found that gut leakage/dysbiosis may have a role in kidney dysfunction in β-TM children by exacerbating the iron-motivated oxidative stress, inflammation, ferroptosis, and modulating SIRT1/HMGB1 axis."

    "title": "Prevalence and risk factors of alloimmunization in multi-transfused pediatric patients: A cross-sectional study from a sub-Himalayan tertiary care hospital in Uttarakhand India.",
    "abstract": "Packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion is critical in managing pediatric patients with conditions requiring frequent transfusions, such as leukemia, thalassemia, and bone marrow disorders. Alloimmunization, the formation of antibodies against foreign antigens present in the donor's blood, is a significant complication of repeated transfusions. Further, auto/alloimmunization is influenced by multiple factors, including antigenic differences between donor and recipient and the recipient's immune status. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of auto/alloimmunization among pediatric patients undergoingmultiple PRBC transfusions in a tertiary care hospital in the sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 113 multi-transfused pediatric patients aged 4 months to 18 years who received more than one PRBC transfusion between September 2022 and August 2023. Antibody screening and identification were performed using column agglutination techniques. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate associations between demographic, clinical factors, and antibody detection. Alloimmunization was observed in 5.31% of patients, with the majority developing antibodies against the MNS blood group system. Autoantibodies were more common, detected in 17.7% of patients. Significant associations were found between the history of prior PRBC transfusions and the formation of alloantibodies (p = 0.005). Age, gender, and ethnicity did not show a statistically significant association with antibody detection. The study reveals a relatively higher prevalence of autoimmunization among multi-transfused pediatric patients. The history of PRBC transfusions was a significant risk factor, indicating the need for extended RBC phenotyping and tailored transfusion strategies to reduce alloimmunization risks in these patients. Most patients and blood donors in this region belong to the local Garhwali community. This homogeneity may help explain the lower rate of alloimmunization observed, suggesting a degree of antigenic similarity among the blood donors and the recipients."

Thirty-four NTDT patients, including 28 NTDT iron chelation without and 6 NTDT with iron chelation, together with 15 normal controls, underwent MRI examination between December 2022 and July 2024 were enrolled in the study. Measured T2* of the pituitary gland, kidney cortex, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen. Liver and spleen volumes were evaluated. Of the 28 patients in NTDT without iron chelation group, 19 patients with iron overload in the liver, 9 patients with iron overload in the kidneys, and 4 patients with iron overload in the spleen. Most patients with abnormal kidney and spleen iron (76.9 %) had liver iron overload. Compared with the control group, NTDT without iron chelation patients had lower T2* in the liver, kidney, and spleen (p < 0.05). And heart T2* was correlated with kidney T2* (r = 0.480, p = 0.010) and pancreas (r = 0.411, p = 0.037). Liver T2* was correlated with spleen T2* (r = 0.479, p = 0.011). Pancreas T2* was correlated with pituitary T2* (r = -0.433, p = 0.031). NTDT patients exhibit significant organ-specific iron overload, particularly in the liver, kidneys, and spleen. The correlations between iron levels in different organs suggest interconnected mechanisms of iron accumulation. These findings highlight the importance of regular MRI screening to monitor and manage iron overload in NTDT patients."

Several reports have shown that <i>KLF1</i> gene mutations are associated with increased levels of Hb F and Hb A<sub>2</sub>. However, scarce population studies have analysed common <i>KLF1</i> variations. This study examines the potential association with Hb F and Hb A<sub>2</sub> levels in β-thalassemia (β-thal) carriers of Portugueseancestry of the four common <i>KLF1</i> gene variants: -251C>G (rs3817621) and -148G>A (rs79334031), in the promoter region; and c.115A>C (p.Met39Leu) (rs112631212) and c.304T>C (p.Ser102Pro) (rs2072597), in exon 2. Ninety-two Portuguese β-thal carriers (43 males and 49 females) aged 2 to 77 years old (mean 32.55 years) were engaged in the study. Hb F levels range from 0.2 to 12.5% and Hb A<sub>2</sub> was above the normal level, ranging from 3.6 to 6%. The Hb A<sub>2</sub> and Hb F levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Minor allele frequencies for SNPs rs3817621 (G), rs79334031 (A), rs112631212 (C) and rs2072597 (C) were 0.196, 0.016, 0.011 and 0.169, respectively. Basic simple linear regression in the total population showed no significant associations with the levels of Hb F (<i>P</i>>0.05). For the low-frequency variant -148A, a statistically significant association was found with increased levels of Hb A<sub>2</sub> (β = 0.855; <i>P</i> = 0.017). In conclusion, an association signal with Hb A<sub>2</sub> levels was observed for the variant -148A>G (rs79334031). The complex pattern of SNP interactions related to their influence on the <i>KLF1</i> transcriptional activity mayexplain the absence of association with Hb F levels."

Observational studies that evaluated cortical and trabecular bone patterns in dental routine radiographs were selected from six bibliographic databases. Risk of bias was analyzed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists. Quality of evidence was verified using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Two hundred three studies were initially retrieved from databases. Three cross-sectional studies, encompassing a total of 129 thalassemic patients, were deemed eligible after applying the inclusion criteria. Bone mineral density (BMD) evaluations were performed using panoramic radiographs and considered the following radiomorphometric indexes: mandibular cortical index (MCI), mandibular cortical width (MCW), panoramic mandibular index (PMI). Fractal dimension analysis (FDA) and simple visual estimation (SVE) were also employed. Overall, FDA and MCW from thalassemia individuals were lower than controls. FDA and MCW are frequently altered in patients with thalassemia and may be employed as screening tools for reduced BMD. However, the certainty of evidence for this outcome was very low, mainly due to methodological flaws."

However, the effects of underlying genetic diseases, replication stress and ageing on haematopoietic reconstitution and lineage specification remain unclear. In this study, we analysed haematopoietic reconstitution in 53 patients treated with lentiviral-HSC-GT for diverse conditions such as metachromatic leukodystrophy<sup>2,3</sup> (MLD), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome<sup>4,5</sup> (WAS) and β-thalassaemia<sup>6</sup> (β-Thal) over a follow-up period of up to 8 years, using vector integration sites as markers of clonal identity. We found that long-term haematopoietic reconstitution was supported by 770 to 35,000 active HSCs. Whereas 50% of transplanted clones demonstrated multi-lineage potential across all conditions, the remaining clones showed a disease-specific preferential lineage output and long-term commitment: myeloid for MLD, lymphoid for WAS and erythroid for β-Thal, particularly in adult patients. Our results indicate that HSC clonogenic activity, lineage output, long-term lineage commitment and rates of somatic mutations are influenced by the underlying disease, patient age at the time of therapy, the extent of genetic defect correction and the haematopoietic stress imposed by the inherited disease. This suggests that HSCs adapt to the pathological condition during haematopoietic reconstitution."

Protein C and protein S were significantly lower in patients with β-thalassemia major in comparison to control. Prothrombin time was significantly prolonged in patients with β-thalassemia major. D. dimer was significantly increase in β-thalassemia major than control. Protein C and protein S level were significantly higher in cases with frequent blood transfusion than in those with non -frequent patient. Prothrombin time and D. dimer also significantly elevated in patients with non-frequent transfusion. These findings suggest that patients with β-thalassemia major may be at a higher risk for coagulation abnormalities and should be closely monitored. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between β-thalassemia major and coagulation parameters."

However, the association between gut/blood microbiome, cognition, and iron burden in thalassemia patients has not been thoroughly investigated. We aimed to determine those associations in thalassemia patients with different blood-transfusion regimens. Sixty participants: healthy controls, transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients, and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) patients, were recruited to evaluate iron overload, cognition, and gut/blood microbiome. TDT patients exhibited greater iron overload than NTDT patients. Most thalassemia patients developed gut dysbiosis, and approximately 25% of the patients developed minor cognitive impairment. Increased Fusobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota with decreased Fibrobacterota were observed in both TDT and NTDT groups. TDT patients showed more abundant beneficial bacteria: Verrucomicrobia. Iron overload was correlated with cognitive impairment. Increased Butyricimonas and decreased Paraclostridium were associated with higher cognitive function. No trace of blood microbiota was observed. Differences in blood bacterial profiles of thalassemia patients and controls were insignificant. These findings suggest iron overload plays a role in the imbalance of gut microbiota and impaired cognitive function in thalassemia patients. Harnessing probiotic potential from those microbes could prevent the gut-brain disturbance in thalassemia patients."

    "abstract": "Approximately one third of the German population has a migration background.According to the federal office for migration, in 2022 around 2,7 million people have taken refuge or have immigrated to Germany, causing major challenges for our health system. In this article, important infectious diseases, and non-infectious conditions like hemoglobinopathies are presented. To date, especially the latter are not common in Germany and must therefore move more into focus when taking care of migrants. Furthermore, new treatment options for hemoglobinopathies have been approved in the last couple of years, starting with the introduction of Luspatercept a few years ago for Beta-Thalassemias and in 2023 the introduction of Voxelotor for sickle cell disease. In 2024 the gene therapy with Exagamglogen-Autotemcel using the CRISPR/Cas molecular scissor was authorized as a new promising treatment for both conditions."

    "title": "Impact of Empagliflozin on the Outcomes of β-Thalassemia Major in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The THALEMPA Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) is a genetic disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolytic anemia, necessitating lifelong blood transfusions and leading to severe complications. This study, termed THALEMPA by the authors, investigated the effect of empagliflozin (EMPA) on β-TM outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), focusing on disease severity and associated complications of iron overload and hyperuricemia. This study conducted a single-center prospective observational investigation involving adults diagnosed with β-TM and T2DM. A total of 20 carefully selected patients were stratified into two groups based on their medical condition: the EMPA group, receiving 10 mg of empagliflozin, and a control group, receiving standard care. This focused cohort size was chosen to ensure a detailed, in-depth analysis of the treatment effects within this specific patient population. Over three months, both groups were closely monitored for β-TM outcomes. The study assessed β-TM severity parameters such as hemoglobin levels, blood transfusion frequency, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), left ventricular ejection fraction percentage, and spleen size. Additionally, β-TM complications were evaluated through serum ferritin and uric acid levels. Our analysis revealed that EMPA increased hemoglobin levels by up to 0.56 g/dL compared to baseline (<i>P </i>< 0.05). Liver enzyme levels significantly improved with EMPA by the third month. AST and ALT decreased by 36.22% and 33.36%, respectively, from baseline levels (<i>P </i>< 0.05), highlighting EMPA's potential benefits for β-TM severity. Serum ferritin and uric acid levels decreased by 27.93% and 21.29%, respectively, over three months on EMPA (<i>P </i>< 0.05). However, other parameters did not show significant changes post-EMPA. This study demonstrates the significant impact of EMPA treatment over three months on β-TM patients with T2DM, evidenced by notable improvements in hemoglobin levels and reductions in liver enzymes, as well as in complications related to iron overload and hyperuricemia. Future research should confirm these benefits over longer durations and assess broader patient outcomes such as quality of life."

    "abstract": "Concurrent recurrence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) in a thalassemia intermedia patient is rare and underscores the complexity of autoimmune disorders. This case emphasizes the importance of considering ADEM in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with PSGN accompanied by neurological symptoms. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is a common group A streptococcal (GAS) infection sequela. The pathophysiology of PSGN involves immune complex deposition, with type 3 hypersensitivity reaction triggered by GAS. Certain neurological conditions may also arise following a GAS infection, possibly due to molecular mimicry in the brain, a pathophysiology similar to rheumatic fever, another common sequel of GAS infection. We present the case of a child with β-thalassemia intermedia who exhibited the classic triad (edema, hypertension, hematuria) of PSGN along with neurological manifestations, including a low glasgow coma scale (GCS) score and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain indicated changes consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Initially treated with methylprednisolone, the patient eventually received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) due to lack of response. The patient had a good outcome, with complete resolution of all symptoms and no residual neurological deficits. This case underscores the importance of considering ADEM in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with neurological signs and symptoms following a recent throat infection with GAS. Furthermore, given the increased risk of infection in thalassemia, patients with thalassemia who have a throat infection and neurological symptoms should be evaluated for the possible presence of ADEM."

The prevalence of β-thalassemia minor among the screened individuals was found to be 3.0%, while those of Hemoglobin E, and δβ-thalassemia carrier states were 0.05%, and 0.03% respectively. Molecular characterization of the β-thalassemia mutations was achieved by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization, followed by next generation sequencing for those left uncharacterized by the former technique. Among 19 β-thalassemia mutations identified, seven were the most frequent, namely: IVS-II-1 (G > A), codon 8/9 (+G), IVS-I-6 (T > C), IVS-I-110 (G > A), IVS-I-I (G > A), IVS-I-5 (G > C) and codon 44 (-C) accounting for 78.5% of the mutations. This study further illustrates the heterogeneity of the spectrum of β-thalassemia in different parts of Iraq, and provides an essential step to facilitate prenatal diagnosis in the setting of a future national thalassemia prevention program."

Iron deficiency anaemia has been associated with most of the common pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, low birthweight and small-for-gestational age infants, and impacts long-term neurocognitive and developmental outcomes in the offspring. Increased adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes are also found with high haemoglobin, thalassaemia and sickle cell traits, and the non-O blood groups especially group AB. Total white cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts and platelet indices can help to predict gestational diabetes mellitus. Results from these tests can be useful by themselves or used in combination with demographics and biomarkers to enhance the screening for high-risk pregnancies."

The carrier rates of β-/α-compound thalassaemia were 7.32% in Li and 0.73% in Han. Additionally, there were regional differences in the distribution of thalassemia among the Li and Han within Hainan Province. Epidemiological characteristics and molecular spectrum of thalassaemia among the Li and Han ethnic groups in Hainan were revealed in this study. These findings can provide a scientific basis to develop and implement prevention strategies for thalassaemia in Hainan."

    "abstract": "Anaemia in sickle cell disease (SCD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, but few studies have reported on the burden and outcome of very severe anaemia. This study described the epidemiology of very severe anaemia by determining the prevalence and incidence, investigating associated clinical and laboratory factors, and assessing outcomes in SCD. A 10-year prospective cohort study involving SCD patients of all ages was conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital in Tanzania between 2004 and 2013. SCD included Homozygous SS-Sickle cell anaemia and Sβ<sup>0</sup> thalassemia at clinics and during hospitalization visits. Very severe anaemia was defined as Haemoglobin <5 g/dL at steady-state which was a period when a patient was stable with no blood transfusion in past 3 months or accute pain report in the previous month. There were 28,293 (92.9%) clinic visits and 2158 hospitalisations amongst 3586 patients. Mean haemoglobin concentration at clinic was 7.4 g/dL, (95% CI: 7.4-7.5) compared to hospitalisation [6.4 g/dL, 95% CI: 6.3-6.5], p < 0.001. Prevalence of very severe anaemia at the clinic was 4.1%, and 23.8% during hospitalization, while the overall incidence was 114.1 (95% CI: 108.2-120.2) events per 1000 person years. Risk ratio of dying for patients with very severe anaemia was 4.78 times higher (95% CI: 3.65-6.25, p < 0.001) than in individuals without very severe anaemia. The risk ratio for mortality was highest in children aged <2 years, and was decreasing steadily with increase in age, from HR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.39-1.35) in children aged 2-4 years to HR of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.20-0.71) in patients in age group 10-17 years when compared to those aged 0-1 years. Mortality risk ratio was higher (HR = 6.76 [95% CI: 4.31-10.62, p < 0.001]) in patients with steady-state haemoglobin <5 g/dL and presenting with very severe anaemia before death compared to those with steady state haemoglobin ≥5 g/dL and haemoglobin ≥5 g/dL before death. The burden of very severe anaemia in SCD was high, especially during hospitalization, and was independent predictor of mortality. There is an urgent need to improve prevention, diagnosis, and interventions for very severe anaemia in SCD in Africa. More research to elucidate the aetiology and mechanisms of anaemia in this population is required.

    "abstract": "Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is known for its variable clinical course, even within families. However, the extent of this heterogeneity has not been well-studied. We aimed to analyze intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity and disease course among siblings in a large cohort of familial PH1 cases. A retrospective registry study was performed using data from OxalEurope. All PH1 families with 2 or more affected siblings were included. A 6-point PH1 clinical outcome scoring system was developed to grade heterogeneity within a family. Intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity was defined as a score ≥2. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to analyze differences in kidney survival between index cases and siblings. We included 88 families, encompassing 193 patients with PH1. The median interquartile range (IQR) follow-up time was 7.8 (1.9-17) years. Intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity, as defined by our score, was found in 38 (43%) PH1 families. In 54% of the families, affected siblings had a better outcome than the index case. Clinically asymptomatic siblings at the time of their diagnosis had a significantly more favorable clinical outcome based on the authors' scoring system than siblings with clinical signs and index cases (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that index cases reached kidney failure at an earlier age and earlier in follow-up compared to siblings (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Intrafamilial clinical heterogeneity was found in a substantial number of familial PH1 cases. Compared to index cases, siblings had significantly better clinical outcomes and kidney survival; thereby supporting the policy of family screening to diagnose affected siblings early to improve their prognosis."

This descriptive/analytical study was conducted in 2019 on children and adolescents with thalassemia aged 7-18 years in Ahvaz, Iran. Overall, 160 patients with the target inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned into four groups (n=40) of people with thalassemia minor, thalassemia major, iron deficiency anemia and healthy individuals. The level of ferritin and vitamin D was assessed. Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon test and Spearman's correlation test were used as well as SPSS Statistics V21. The mean age of the participants was 13.07 ± 3.82 yr and 100 people (62.5%) were male. In terms of vitamin D deficiency, 16 people (40%) had severe deficiency in iron deficiency group. The highest level of ferritin was found in thalassemia major group and the lowest in iron deficiency group. Regarding the level of vitamin D and ferritin in the healthy group, there was a statistically significant difference between mean vitamin D and serum ferritin levels (<i>P</i>=0.027). In iron deficiency group, this level of ferritin was observed with mild deficiency (<i>P</i>=0.017). In thalassemia major group, the increase in ferritin was associated with severe vitamin D deficiency (<i>P</i>=0.05. Severe vitamin D is seen in thalassemia major due to the increase in ferritin, but moderate deficiency of this vitamin in healthy people and mild deficiency in iron deficiency anemia group was observed considering the normal levels of ferritin."

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of macrophage polarization can prevent the invasion of trophoblast cells and further limit spiral artery remodeling in preeclampsia (PE). However, its mechanism is obscure. HTR8-/Svneo cells were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the culture supernatants were extracted. Next, the cells were incubated with those EVs to investigate their effects on trophoblasts. A co-culture system consisting of HTR8-/Svneo cells and macrophages was used to reveal how the trophoblast-derived EVs affected the macrophage subtype. Finally, a PE mouse model and miR-141-3p knockout mice were used to verify the function of miR-141-3p in PE. Hypoxia induced abnormal increases in the levels of miR-141-3p in HTR8-/Svneo cells and EVs. EVs from hypoxia-treated HTR8-/Svneo cells could downregulate PTEN, a potential target of miR-141-3p, and inhibit trophoblast mitophagy and invasion. However, HTR8-/Svneo cells transfected with an miR-141-3p inhibitor could attenuate the influence of EVs. In an HTR8-/Svneo cell plus macrophage co-culture system, hypoxia-pretreated cells promoted the transformation of macrophages into the M1-phenotye, and HTR8-/Svneo invasion was inhibited by the macrophages. MiR-141 from EVs could target and downregulate dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) expression in macrophages, induce formation of the M1 macrophage phenotype in THP-1 cells, downregulate DUSP1 expression, and upregulate TAB2/TAK1 signaling. These results were also demonstrated in normal pregnant mice and PE pregnant mice. A hypoxic environment could upregulate miR-141 expression in the EVs of HTR8-/Svneo cells, and THP-1-derived macrophages could uptake EVs releasing miR-141 to downregulate DUSP1 expression and induce the formation of M1 macrophages, which can lead to the development of PE."

BCL11A binds at a cognate recognition site (TGACCA) in the γ-globin gene promoter and represses its expression. DNA-binding is mediated by a triple zinc finger domain, designated ZnF456. Here, we report comprehensive investigation of ZnF456, leveraging X-ray crystallography and NMR to determine the structures in both the presence and absence of DNA. We delve into the dynamics and mode of interaction with DNA. Moreover, we discovered that the last zinc finger of BCL11A (ZnF6) plays a different role compared to ZnF4 and 5, providing a positive entropic contribution to DNA binding and γ-globin gene repression.

    "abstract": "A high amount of iron in β-thalassemia patients can lead to oxidative stress and organ dysfunction, especially liver, the main iron accumulated organ. Iron catabolism causes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering liver inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Deferiprone-resveratrol hybrid (DFP-RVT) is chemically synthesized by combining deferiprone (DFP) and resveratrol (RVT) which shows an iron-chelating property along with antioxidant activity. This study explored the hepatoprotective effect of DFP-RVT in iron overloaded β-knockout (BKO) thalassemic mice. The results revealed that DFP-RVT treatment improved liver function in iron-overloaded BKO mice by reducing liver enzymes and increasing hepcidin levels compared to iron overload control mice. Both DFP alone and DFP-RVT treatment groups demonstrated iron chelation effects by decreasing liver iron content (LIC), iron profiles, and iron deposition in the liver. Moreover, DFP-RVT powerfully showed antioxidant properties by decreasing liver and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and increasing reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Interestingly, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), which can contribute to chronic liver disease through liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, is highly expressed in iron-overloaded mice. However, both DFP and DFP-RVT treatment significantly reduced TGFβ1 levels compared to the iron-overloaded group. Therefore, DFP-RVT could be a potent hepatoprotective compound through the mobilization of iron, reduction of ROS, improvement of liver enzymes, and alleviation of liver damage, potentially relieving liver dysfunction in iron-overloaded BKO mice."

    "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is regulated by the differential expression of many genes. Besides being transcriptionally regulated, these genes are also with the oath of epigenetic regulation by the microRNAs (miRNAs), in particular. Various miRNAs appear to be very important for the normal process of erythropoiesis and various hematological abnormalities in humans. Therefore, the review aims to summarize the significance of miRNAs in erythropoiesis and different hematological diseases with clinical importance. Our analysis indicates that specific miRNAs regulate erythropoiesis in a stage-specific manner from hematopoietic stem cells to differentiated erythrocytes. Further, many miRNAs have been reported to be linked with various hematological diseases. The importance of miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets for various hematological disorders like anemia, β-thalassemia, and leukemia has been revealed through various clinical studies and clinical trials. The miR-34a mimic and miR-155 inhibitor demonstrate promising therapeutic effects in various hematological malignancies. Additionally, miR-34a, miR-538e, miR-193e, and miR-198 exhibit diagnostic potential in acute myeloid leukemia, while miR-451, miR-151-5p, and miR-1290 show diagnostic potential in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, this review encompasses the latest observations and implications of specific miRNAs in erythropoiesis and various hematological disorders. However, challenges persist in developing safe and efficient delivery strategies to target miRNAs specifically, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Future mechanistic pre-clinical and clinical research would contribute to overcoming these challenges."

    "abstract": "Children often develop phobia toward needle pricks and invasive procedures. It is difficult for medical personnel to manage children's pain when they are in the hospital. When it comes to assessing and treating children's discomfort, nurses interact with them the most. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Buzzy Bee device on pain perception among children undergoing invasive needle pricks as part of their treatment. The study used a quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental design employing simple random sampling. A post-test-only design was used. After obtaining ethical clearance, data collection was done in the pediatric outpatient department and pediatric wards of Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between February 2020 and August 2021. Faces Pain Rating Scale for children was used to rate the pain during the procedure, which is a standardized tool. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 23. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were done to analyze the data. Totally, 120 children along with their parents were interested in the study. After taking appropriate parental consent and children's assent, the participants were recruited by simple random sampling. They were equally divided into 60 in the experimental group and 60 in the control group. The mean age was 8.14 (+/-2.3) in both groups. Among the 120 samples, 63 (52.5%) of them were males and 57 (47.5%) were females. The majority of them had diagnoses like thalassemia, leukemia, and sickle cell and were getting cannulated for blood transfusion therapy. <i>t</i>-test shows that 51.7% (31 samples) reported no pain in the experimental group and 33.3% (20 samples) reported only mild pain, whereas in the control group, only 5.0% (3 samples) reported no pain and 21.7% (13 samples) reported mild pain. About 26.7% of the samples reported very much pain as against the 7% who reported very much pain in the interventional group. There was a statistically significant difference in the pain scores between the control group and the experimental group (likelihood ratio test, <i>P</i> = 0.0001). The Buzzy Bee method significantly reduced the pain. The introduction of a toy-like, child-friendly device, which works on the mechanism of vibrations and cold application, lessened the pain intensity during the procedure and acted as a good distractive therapy for children."

    "title": "Iron overload and liver function in patients with beta thalassemia major: A cross sectional study.",
    "abstract": "In thalassemia major, repeated blood transfusions result in iron overload causing organ damage. The objective of this study was assessment of liver enzymes in patients with Thalassemia major and to observe their association with ferritin. A cross-sectional study was performed, at Islamabad Medical and Dental College and its affiliated Akbar Niazi Teaching Hospital from November 2021 till August 2022. Serum ferritin, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin levels were determined, in 135 patients of beta thalassemia major receiving transfusions. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. For categorical variables, calculation of frequencies and percentages was performed. Mean (± standard deviation) was determined for quantitative variables. ANOVA with post hoc Tukey's test was used for determining association between liver enzymes and serum ferritin. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. The correlation between ferritin and LFTs was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Patients had an age range of 7-30 years, and males constituted 51% of sample. Mean level of ferritin was 6062.61 + 3641.79 ng/ml, with an insignificant difference between the genders (<i>p</i> =0.366). The levels of AST, ALT and bilirubin were perceived to show a significant increase in patients with ferritin levels >5000ng/ml, when compared with patients having ferritin levels < 2,500 ng/ml. A significant positive correlation of increasing serum ferritin levels was observed with ALT (r= 0.682), to a lesser extent with AST (r = 0.532), and only a weak correlation with serum bilirubin (r = 0.350). Liver damage was caused by increased iron deposition. LFTs should be performed regularly to detect and reduce liver damage by increasing chelation therapy, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality due to thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder that poses significant challenges for affected children and their families. Caregivers, particularly mothers, often experience difficulties in managing their child's condition. Understanding their current experience is crucial for improving care and support. This study aimed to explore the experiences of mothers caring for children with thalassemia in Banten, Indonesia. A qualitative descriptive approach was employed, involving semi-structured in-depth interviews with eleven mothers of children diagnosed with thalassemia. Data were collected from April to May 2023. The interviews were audio recorded, and the data were analyzed verbatim using Colaizzi's method to identify key themes related to the experiences. Three themes were developed: 1) Perception of thalassemia as a genetic condition, 2) Emotional, logistical, and practical caregiving challenges, and 3) Support received by mothers in caring for children with thalassemia. The findings highlight the multifaceted challenges faced by mothers of children with thalassemia and emphasize the need for improved communication, emotional support, and care coordination from nurses and healthcare providers. Future research should focus on expanding support systems and exploring effective interventions to enhance the quality of life for families navigating the complexities of chronic illness."

    "title": "AZD8055 Is More Effective Than Rapamycin in Inhibiting Proliferation and Promoting Mitochondrial Clearance in Erythroid Differentiation.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> As an important downstream effector of various signaling pathways, mTOR plays critical roles in regulating many physiological processes including erythropoiesis. It is composed of two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which differ in their components and downstream signaling effects. Our previous study revealed that the inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin significantly repressed the erythroid progenitor expansion in the early stage but promoted enucleation and mitochondria clearance in the late stage of erythroid differentiation. However, the particular roles and differences of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the regulation of erythropoiesis still remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the comparative effects of dual mTORC1/mTORC2 mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 and mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin on erythroid differentiation in K562 cells induced by hemin and erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia mouse model. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In vitro erythroid differentiation model of hemin-induced K562 cells and β-thalassemia mouse model were treated with AZD8055 and rapamycin. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect cell viability. The cell proliferation, cell cycle, erythroid surface marker expression, mitochondrial content, and membrane potential were determined and analyzed by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation was measured by RT-qPCR. The mTORC2/mTORC1 and autophagy pathway was evaluated using western blotting. <b>Results:</b> Both AZD8055 and rapamycin treatments increased the expression levels of the erythroid differentiation-specific markers, CD235a, <i>α</i>-globin, <i>γ</i>-globin, and <i>ε</i>-globin. Notably, AZD8055 suppressed the cell proliferation and promoted the mitochondrial clearance of hemin-induced K562 cells more effectively than rapamycin. In a mouse model of <i>β</i>-thalassemia, both rapamycin and AZD8055 remarkably improve erythroid cell maturation and anemia. Moreover, AZD8055 and rapamycin treatment inhibited the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced autophagy, whereas AZD8055 enhanced autophagy more effectively than rapamycin. Indeed, AZD8055 treatment inhibited both mTORC2 and mTORC1 pathway in hemin-induced K562 cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> AZD8055 is more effective than rapamycin in inhibiting proliferation and promoting mitochondrial clearance in erythroid differentiation, which might provide us one more therapeutic option other than rapamycin for ineffective erythropoiesis treatment in the future. These findings also provide some preliminary information indicating the roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in erythropoiesis, and further studies are necessary to dissect the underlying mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective hemoglobin synthesis, leading to severe complications such as iron overload and multi-organ dysfunction. This study aims to elucidate the distinctive clinical and biochemical profiles of TDT patients compared to healthy controls, with an emphasis on cardiovascular risk assessment using novel markers such as the Plasma Atherogenic Index (PAI) and Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index. This cross-sectional study included 32 TDT patients and 36 healthy controls, matched for age and gender. Comprehensive demographic, laboratory, and imaging data were collected and analyzed. TDT patients were further stratified based on cardiac involvement and ferritin levels. Key assessments included hemoglobin levels, liver enzymes, lipid profiles, and cardiac imaging. The PAI and TyG index were calculated to evaluate cardiovascular risks. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 27.0, employing Student's <i>t</i>-test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, and Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. No significant differences in basic demographic parameters were observed between groups; however, TDT patients exhibited significant clinical and laboratory differences. Notably, these patients had lower hemoglobin levels, higher platelet counts, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and markedly increased ferritin levels. Lipid profiles were significantly altered, with lower levels of total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL but elevated triglycerides. Importantly, the PAI was significantly higher in TDT patients, suggesting an increased atherosclerotic risk. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with cardiac involvement had worse metabolic profiles, higher TyG indices, and prolonged QT intervals, indicating heightened cardiovascular risk. As the iron burden increases, the TyG index and PAI may lose their sensitivity in distinguishing between varying levels of iron overload, suggesting that their effectiveness plateaus beyond a certain threshold of iron accumulation. TDT patients show significant hematological and metabolic deviations, including elevated cardiovascular risk markers like PAI and TyG index. As iron burden increases, these markers lose discriminative power, and cardiac involvement escalates rapidly once a critical iron threshold is surpassed, as supported by studies showing a non-linear relationship between iron load and cardiac complications. Comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and tailored management are essential for these patients. Future studies should focus on tracking cardiovascular risk progression and the effects of targeted interventions."

    "abstract": "Neutrophil dysfunction is a form of immune suppression in patients with β-thalassemia (Beta-thal), although data on this are limited. In this study, blood from patients and healthy volunteers was analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an increase in immature neutrophils (CD16- CD62L+) and aged (senescent) neutrophils (CD16+ CD62L-) in Beta-thal patients compared to healthy volunteers. The Beta-thal neutrophils demonstrated less prominent chemotaxis and phagocytosis than healthy neutrophils at the baseline. With phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulations, some of the indicators, including the flow cytometry markers (CD11b, CD62L, CD66b, CD63, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs; detected by anti-citrullinated histone 3 immunofluorescence), were lower than the control. Additionally, low-density neutrophils (LDNs), which are found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction, were observed in Beta-thal patients but not in the control group. The expression of CD11b, CD66b, CD63, arginase I, and ROS in LDNs was higher than the regular normal-density neutrophils (NDNs). The proliferation rate of CD3+ T cells isolated from the PBMC fraction of healthy volunteers was higher than that of the cells from patients with Beta-thal. The incubation of red blood cell (RBC) lysate plus ferric ions with healthy NDNs transformed the NDNs into the aged neutrophils (decreased CD62L) and LDNs. In conclusion, iron overload induces neutrophil diversity along with some dysfunctions."

We carried out a retrospective study involving 140 patients with TDT. The mean patient age was 8.7 ± 3.2 years, with a median serum ferritin (SF) level of 3791.4 ng/ml (IQR: 2424.1-5733.3 ng/ml). Pulmonary function abnormalities were detected in 46.43 % (65 out of 140) of patients, primarily manifesting as diffusion dysfunction (26.43 %), followed by ventilatory dysfunction (5.0 %), and mixed pulmonary dysfunction (15.0 %). A serum ferritin level above 2500 ng/ml significantly correlated with the occurrence of these abnormalities(OR = 3.187, 95%CI:1.312-7.741, P = 0.010), while higher hemoglobin concentrations demonstrated a protective effect (OR = 0.966, 95%CI: 0.943-0.989, P = 0.004). Our study highlights diffusion dysfunction as the most prevalent type of pulmonary function abnormalities in TDT patients. Furthermore, it establishes a correlation between elevated serum ferritin levels and pulmonary dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a heterogenous group of hemoglobinopathies; intermediate thalassemia's phenotype can be very variegated due to different genetic matching. Before NGS-era, diagnosis often mismatched with phenotypes, hiding some genetic findings that nowadays could completely explain clinical presentation. In this report, we emphasize the importance of reevaluating genetic testing to achieve a correct diagnosis in case of phenotype mismatch thalassemia. Starting from a suspect of δ/β thalassemia heterozygosity, reevaluating revealed heterozygosity for α-gene triplication combined to δ and β heterozygosity, a new finding that completely suited patient's clinical manifestation. This case provided the opportunity to underline that an extended study on total globin genes is essential for correct diagnosis of thalassemia, especially when clinical onset phenotypes are more divisive and questionable at a first clinical work-up."

    "abstract": "Obstructive azoospermia commonly is caused by CBAVD(Congenital Bilateral Aplasia of the Vas Deferens), mainly due to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G2(ADGRG2) mutations. The genetic landscape for Chinese CBAVD patients is unclear, leading to debates over genetic screening, counseling, and assisted reproduction strategies. This study investigates the prevalence of CFTR and ADGRG2 mutations in a southern Chinese cohort of CBAVD patients and evaluates the impact of CFTR mutations on intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes. CFTR mutations were identified in 71.4% (30/42) of CBAVD patients, with a total of 36 CFTR mutation sites across 13 types identified, including two novel mutations. A novel ADGRG2 mutation was also detected. Betweenthe CFTR mutation-CBAVD group and the non-CBAVD OA group, a significant difference was observed only in the 2 Pronuclei(2PN) rate (79.5% vs 86.2%, P = 0.0065), while fertilization rates, pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, and live birth rates showed no significant differences. Between the CFTR mutation-CBAVD group and the CBAVD group without CFTR mutation, there were no significant differences in fertilization rates, 2PN rates, pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, or live birth rates. Chinese CBAVD patients primarily exhibit mutations in the CFTR and ADGRG2 genes. Therefore, targeted gene testing for CFTR and ADGRG2 is more suitable compared to WES for CBAVD patients. Considering that the genetic factors of approximately 30% of CBAVD patients remain unknown, it is recommended to perform massive parallel sequencing for patients who test negative for CFTR and ADGRG2 gene screening. Despite these genetic factors, ICSI outcomes were not adversely affected, except for the 2PN rate. However, genetic counseling remains crucial for Chinese CBAVD patients before undergoing assisted reproduction."

This prospective cohort study was conducted on 228 ICU hospitalized patients. The risk of VTE was estimated using the Autar and Padua scales during the first 48 hours after admission. The predictive accuracy of the above two risk assessment scales for VTE in ICU patients was compared based on the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Results of ROC analysis indicated the area under the curve (AUC) values for the Autar (0.61 ± 0.05) and Pauda (0.53 ± 0.06). Log-rank test showed no difference in AUCs (<i>P</i> = 0.19). Moreover, the accuracy of the Autar scale and Padua obtained 24% and 14% respectively. Both scales had 100% sensitivity but their specificity was low (Autar 14% and Padua 3%). The positive likelihood ratios (LR+) were 1.17 for Autar and 1.03 for Padua. The negative likelihood ratios (LR-) were 0 for Autar and 0.89 for Padua. Inter-rater agreement values obtained 0.99 and 0.95 respectively for the the Autar and Padua scales. The AUC, accuracy, and LR+ of the Autar risk assessment scale were higher than the Padua scale in predicting VTE. However, both scales had excellent reliability, high sensitivity and low specificity. It is recommended that the risk of VTE is recorded by the Autar scale for patients admitted to ICUs. It can help the healthcare team in the use of prophylaxis for those that are at high risk for VTE."

We conducted a retrospective study of pregnant adolescents' medical records and laboratory data recorded during their first prenatal consultation. The laboratory workout was performed in the Thalassemia Prevention Unit of the Hippokration Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece, from 2013 to 2022. Two hundred nine of the adolescents were of Greek Nationality (88.3 %) (86 Greek natives of the general population; 41.1 %, 112 members of the Roma community; 53.5 %, 11 members of the Muslim minority of Thrace; 5.2 %) and 29 (11.6 %) were immigrants from the Balkans, Middle East, and Asia. The mean age (± standard deviation) of the 238 pregnant women in our study's cohort was 16.67 ± 1.67 years, and the majority of them (90 %) were approximately between 15-19 years, and 10 % were between 12-14 years.

For effective management, it is vital to distinguish between these two conditions. Existing diagnostic methods have some limitations due to their inaccessibility and high cost. This study aims to evaluate novel hematological indices for distinguishing IDA from TT, offering potential improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Objective To compare the efficacy of novel hematological indices in differentiating IDA from TT, and to assess their sensitivity and specificity in clinical practice. Methods This cross-sectional observational study included 80 anemia patients (40 diagnosed cases of IDA and 40 of TT each). Hematological parameters were measured using the Sysmex XN-1000 analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan), and statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney test, Pearson correlation coefficient (r), and correlation matrix. Results Significant differences were observed between IDA and TT patients in the indices studied. The Green and King Index demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 82%. The red cell distribution width (RDW) Index exhibited similar diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 77%. The England and Fraser Index showed a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 80%, with a large effect size (r = -0.60). The correlation matrix revealed strong associations between key parameters, including a negative correlation between hemoglobin and RDW Index (r = -0.61) and a positive correlation between mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and Shine and Lal Index (r = 0.82). On the other hand, our study found that indices like Shine and Lal and Srivastava had limited diagnostic value, with smaller effect sizes (r = 0.28 and r = -0.005, respectively). Conclusion Hematological indices, such as the Green and King, RDW, and England and Fraser indices, show strong potential for differentiating IDA from TT, with high sensitivity, specificity, and large effect sizes. The correlation matrix further supports the diagnostic utility of these indices. These tools can enhance diagnostic precision in resource-limited settings and improve patient outcomes."

    "title": "Exosomes with Engineered Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor on Their Surfaces Can Proliferate Menstrual Blood Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells: Targeted Delivery for a Protein Drug.",
    "abstract": "Despite the efficacy of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neuro-regenerative medicine, it can't pass the blood-brain barrier. Recently, exosomes have been harnessed for targeted delivery of therapeutics into brain. Given these facts, an engineered exosome capable of BDNF expression on the surface would be an amenable tool for drug delivery. The BDNF gene was cloned into a plex-lamp lentiviral vector and virus particles were packaged using the Torano method. HEK293T cells were transduced by the purified viruses to produce and purify recombinant exosomes displaying the fusion protein on their surfaces. Western blot, Zeta sizer, TEM, and ELISA methods were used for exosome characterization. The effect of engineered exosomes on menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Mens-MSCs) proliferation was evaluated by cell counting assay, MTT assay, and qPCR on the bcl2 and nestin genes. Approximately, 1.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> TdU/ml of the viral particles was purified from the transfected cells and transduced into the HEK293T. Western blot and ELISA methods confirmed the surface display of the LAMP-BDNF fusion. TEM graphs and Zeta sizer results confirmed the morphology and the size of purified exosomes. Treatment of Mens-MSCs with the targeted exosomes augmented the expression level of bcl2 and nestin genes, increased the cell proliferation, and elevated the cell number. Chimeric BDNF on the exosome surface could retain its biological activity and elevate the expression of bcl2 and nestin genes. Moreover, these exosomes are capable of elevating the Mens-MSCs proliferation."

    "title": "Differential gut microbiota composition in β-Thalassemia patients and its correlation with iron overload.",
    "abstract": "Recent research highlights the significant impact of the gut microbiota on health and disease. Thalassemia, a hereditary blood disorder, requires regular blood transfusions, leading to an accumulation of iron in the body. Such changes could potentially alter the intestinal microbiota, thereby increasing the susceptibility of thalassemic patients to infection. In this study, we analyzed the fecal microbiota of 70 non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) β-thalassemia/HbE patients and 30 healthy controls. Our findings indicate that iron chelation intervention had no detectable effect on the microbiome profile of thalassemic patients. However, the cross-sectional analysis revealed that the bacterial diversity and community structure in patients were significantly less diverse and distinct compared to those of healthy subjects. Using reference frames, we were also able to demonstrate that bacterial taxa that are known to produce short chain fatty acids, from the genera Alistipes, Coprococcus, and Oscillospira, and those from the family Ruminococcaceae, were less prevalent in the patients. In contrast, bacterial taxa associated with an unhealthy gut, including the genus Clostridium and those from the families Fusobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Peptostrptococcaceae, were more prevalent in patients and found to be correlated with higher levels of ferritin. Collectively, these changes in the microbiota could be regarded as markers of raised ferritin levels, and therefore, awareness should be exercised as they could interfere, albeit indirectly, with the treatment of the co-morbidities of thalassemia."

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing has long been recognized as a powerful tool to expand the diversity of the transcriptome and the proteome. The study of hematopoiesis, from hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation into committed progenitors to maturation into functional blood cells, has led the field of stem cell research and cellular differentiation for decades. The importance of aberrant splicing due to mutations in cis has been exemplified in thalassemias, resulting from aberrant expression of β-globin. The simultaneous development of increasingly sophisticated technologies, in particular the combination of multicolor flow cytometric cell sorting with bulk and single-cell sequencing, has provided sophisticated insights into the complex regulation of the blood system. The recognition that mutations in key splicing factors drive myeloid malignancies, in particular myelodysplastic syndromes, has galvanized research into alternative splicing in hematopoiesis and its diseases. In this review, we will update the audience on the exciting novel technologies, highlight alternative splicing events and their regulators with essential functions in hematopoiesis, and provide a high-level overview how splicing factor mutations contribute to hematologic malignancies."

    "abstract": "Nuclear receptor TR4 (NR2C2) was previously shown to bind to the -117 position of the γ-globin gene promoters in vitro, which overlaps the more recently described BCL11 transcription factor A (BCL11A) binding site. The role of TR4 in human γ-globin gene repression has not been extensively characterized in vivo, whereas any relationship between TR4 and BCL11A regulation through the γ-globin promoters is unclear at present. We show here that TR4 and BCL11A competitively bind in vitro to distinct, overlapping sequences, including positions overlapping -117 of the γ-globin promoter. We found that TR4 represses γ-globin transcription and fetal hemoglobin accumulation in vivo in a BCL11A-independent manner. Finally, examination of the chromatin occupancy of TR4 within the β-globin locus, compared with BCL11A, shows that both bind avidly to the locus control region and other sites, but only BCL11A binds to the γ-globin promoters at statistically significant frequency. These data resolve an important discrepancy in the literature and, thus, clarify possible approaches to the treatment of sickle cell disease and β-thalassaemia."

To establish the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing for single-gene disorders in unexplained NIHF and to evaluate the clinical utility of data reanalysis. A series of 53 unexplained cases of NIHF were enrolled, including 39 cases met a strict definition of NIHF and 14 cases with increased nuchal translucency (NT) and/or cystic hygroma in combination with other fluid collections. Trio ES from fetal samples and parental blood was performed, and clinical reports were returned by geneticists and genetic counselors. Multidisciplinary team forums were conducted for accurate diagnoses and improved patient management. The clinical follow-up assessments were conducted, and the reanalysis was performed for cases with a non-positive result. Diagnostic variants were identified in 22.6% (12/53) of the cases, and variants of potential clinical significance were detected in an additional 13.2% (7/53) of the cases. Of them, three possible diagnoses (3/41, 7.3%) were obtained during reanalysis. Notably, half of the diagnosed cases were from the group exhibiting only skin edema and increased NT and/or cystic hygroma. The diagnostic rate in this group was 42.8% (6/14), while in the classically defined NIHF group, the rate was 15.4% (6/39). The pregnancy termination and live birth rates of the cases with positive genetic testing results were found to be statistically significantly different from those with negative results (91.7% vs. 53.6% and 8.3% vs. 36.6%, P < 0.05 for both). ES provides high incremental diagnostic yield for NIHF after standard-of-care testing, and reevaluating non-diagnostic exomes in light of updated knowledge can maximize diagnostic yield. Identifying the etiology of NIHF facilitates prenatal diagnosis, improves the management of NIHF cases and predicts recurrence risk in future pregnancies."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among the caregivers of pediatric patients with betathalassemia major in blood transfusion centres in Bangalore, India. Their knowledge, attitude, and acceptance regarding bone marrow transplantation were assessed using a validated questionnaire. The study aimed to identify factors that influence caregivers' decision about bone marrow transplantation. The knowledge, attitude, and acceptance of the caregivers towards bone marrow transplantation are shown to depend on gender, education and socio-economic status. The results of this study reveal that male caregivers generally exhibited higher levels of knowledge and had a better attitude towards it as compared to their female counterparts. Higher education and socio-economic status were associated with better knowledge, more favourable attitudes and a higher acceptance towards the procedure."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) is one of the global public health concerns highlighted by the World Health Organization. Patients with TDT require regular blood transfusion to survive. However, the availability of blood resources is extremely limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate transfusion burden and willingness to pay (WTP) for temporary remission of anemia status among patients with TDT and to explore the associated factors. Adult patients with TDT were recruited through cluster sampling across several high-incidence provinces in China. Consenting patients completed online questionnaires on demographic information, transfusion burden and WTP with real-time WeChat communication assistance from researchers. The guiding techniques of double-bounded dichotomous choices and open-ended questions in the contingent valuation method (CVM) were used to obtain participants' WTP for 1 unit of leukocyte-depleted red blood cells. WTP calculations were performed using maximum likelihood estimation, with further insights gained through subgroup analysis based on gender, family monthly income level and convenience of blood transfusion. The analysis included 149 TDT patients from five high-incidence provinces, with an average monthly income of $198.5. Patients received an average of 3.7 units per transfusion, 15.4 times annually, with an average WTP of $70.4 per unit (95% CI [62.0, 78.9]). Estimated WTP for temporary anemia alleviation per transfusion totaled $260.6, exceeding monthly income by 1.32 times. Higher WTP was observed among males, higher-income households, and those with at least junior education. Lower WTP was noted among patients with lower transfusion volumes and those needing to travel for transfusion or during hospitalization for blood transfusion. High WTP indicated a strong desire for temporary anemia relief. Most TDT patients faced significant economic and transfusion burden. The evident gap in meeting clinical needed underscores the urgent demand for innovative treatments to reduce transfusion dependency, potentially transforming TDT care and improving socioeconomic well-being and clinical outcomes. These findings supported evidence-based decision-making for TDT pharmacoeconomics and efficient healthcare resource allocation in China."

    "abstract": "Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) is one of the most common tumours of the female reproductive system. CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is a member of the transcription factor family involved in regulating processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and the immune response. However, the role of CEBPA in UCEC has not been clarified. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis to explore the expression level, prognostic value, immune infiltration and biological function of CEBPA in UCEC. In this study, we found that CEBPA expression was upregulated and associated with poor prognosis in UCEC patients. KEGG and GO analyses revealed that the genes positively correlated with CEBPA were enriched primarily in immune regulation and oxidative phosphorylation. Immune infiltration analysis revealed that CEBPA is strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration in UCEC. RT-qPCR indicated that CEBPA may regulate the OXPHOS level in Ishikawa cells. CCK-8, cell cycle, Transwell and scratch wound healing assays revealed that CEBPA promoted Ishikawa cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In addition, PPI and survival analyses suggested that CEBPG may be a potential target of CEBPA in UCEC. These results demonstrated that CEBPA may be a potential therapeutic target in UCEC."

    "title": "Delivery Aspects for Implementing siRNA Therapeutics for Blood Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Hematological disorders result in significant health consequences, and traditional therapies frequently entail adverse reactions without addressing the root cause. A potential solution for hematological disorders characterized by gain-of-function mutations lies in the emergence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules as a therapeutic option. siRNAs are a class of RNA molecules composed of double-stranded RNAs that can degrade specific mRNAs, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of underlying disease proteins. Therapeutic interventions utilizing siRNA can be tailored to selectively target genes implicated in diverse hematological disorders, including sickle cell anemia, β-thalassemia, and malignancies such as lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia. The development of efficient siRNA silencers necessitates meticulous contemplation of variables such as the RNA backbone, stability, and specificity. Transportation of siRNA to specific cells poses a significant hurdle, prompting investigations of diverse delivery approaches, including chemically modified forms of siRNA and nanoparticle formulations with various biocompatible carriers. This review delves into the crucial role of siRNA technology in targeting and treating hematological malignancies and disorders. It sheds light on the latest research, development, and clinical trials, detailing how various pharmaceutical approaches leverage siRNA against blood disorders, mainly concentrating on cancers. It outlines the preferred molecular targets and physiological barriers to delivery while emphasizing the growing potential of various therapeutic delivery methods. The need for further research is articulated in the context of overcoming the shortcomings of siRNA in order to enrich discussions around siRNA's role in managing blood disorders and aiding the scientific community in advancing more targeted and effective treatments."

The application of these molecular scissors for genome engineering earned the developing researchers the Nobel prize in Chemistry in the year 2020. At present, the potential of this technology to improve global challenges continues to grow exponentially. CRISPR-Cas9 shows promise in the recent advances made in the Global North such as the FDA-approved gene therapy for the treatment of sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassemia and the gene editing of porcine kidney for xenotransplantation into humans affected by end-stage kidney failure. Limited resources, low government investment with an allocation of 1% of gross domestic production to research and development including a shortage of skilled professionals and lack of knowledge may preclude the use of this revolutionary technology in the Global South where the countries involved have reduced science and technology budgets. Focusing on the practical application of genome engineering, successful genetic manipulation is not easily accomplishable and is influenced by the chromatin landscape of the target locus, guide RNA selection, the experimental design including the profiling of the gene edited cells, which impacts the overall outcome achieved. Our assessment primarily delves into economical approaches of performing efficient genome engineering to support the first-time user restricted by limited resources with the aim of democratizing the use of the technology across low- and middle-income countries. Here we provide a comprehensive overview on existing experimental techniques, the significance for target locus analysis and current pitfalls such as the underrepresentation of global genetic diversity. Several perspectives of genome engineering approaches are outlined, which can be adopted in a resource limited setting to enable a higher success rate of genome editing-based innovations in low- and middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "The analysis of tissues of origin of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of research and diagnostic interest. Many studies focused on bisulfite treatment or immunoprecipitation protocols to assess the tissues of origin of cfDNA. DNA loss often occurs during such processes. Fragmentomics of cfDNA molecules has uncovered a wealth of information related to tissues of origin of cfDNA. There is still much room for the development of tools for assessing contributions from various tissues into plasma using fragmentomic features. Hence, we developed an approach to analyze the relative contributions of DNA from different tissues into plasma, by identifying characteristic fragmentation patterns associated with selected histone modifications. We named this technique as FRAGmentomics-based Histone modification Analysis (FRAGHA). Deduced placenta-specific histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)-associated signal correlated well with the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.96). The deduced liver-specific H3K27ac-associated signal correlated with the donor-derived DNA fraction in liver transplantation recipients (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.92) and was significantly increased in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<i>P</i> < 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Significant elevations of erythroblasts-specific and colon-specific H3K27ac-associated signals were observed in patients with β-thalassemia major and colorectal cancer, respectively. Furthermore, using the fragmentation patterns from tissue-specific H3K27ac regions, a machine learning algorithm was developed to enhance HCC detection, with an area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.97. Finally, genomic regions with H3K27ac or histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) were found to exhibit different fragmentomic patterns of cfDNA. This study has shed light on the relationship between cfDNA fragmentomics and histone modifications, thus expanding the armamentarium of liquid biopsy."

This review aimed to assess the impact of NAC on oxidative stress biomarkers in patients with β-thalassemia. The review included articles published before 2024 that investigated the effects of NAC on oxidative stress in individuals with β-thalassemia. A comprehensive search was conducted across various databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Trip, and CENTRAL. Only English-language clinical trials were considered for inclusion in this review. Besides, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated based on the included studies. Ninety-nine articles were retrieved from electronic databases, and after a thorough review, eight articles were selected for comprehensive text analysis. The highest dose of NAC administered was 10 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 600 mg/day) over a period of 3-6 months. All the studies assessing the impact of NAC on oxidative stress indicators in β-thalassemia patients demonstrated positive effects during the 3-month follow-up period. Most estimated NNTs fell into 1-5, suggesting significant clinical therapeutic value in this context. The current potency of NAC alone appears to be effective in ameliorating oxidative stress in patients with β-thalassemia major. While a 3-month duration seems adequate to demonstrate the antioxidant properties of NAC in this population, larger and well-designed clinical trials are warranted. Current clinical evidence possesses a high risk of bias."

Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) play roles in the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway and maintain the stability of cellular hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) in response to low oxygen levels or hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibition of PHDs has been shown to increase HbF production in erythroid progenitors derived from healthy donors. Here, we demonstrated the relationship between PHD2, the main PHD isoform, and clinical phenotypes in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE disease. Although the targeted sequencing annotated several common variants within <i>EGLN1</i>, the gene encoding PHD2, none of these variants were located in the functional domains of PHD2 and were irrelevant to the clinical phenotypes. CRISPR-mediated <i>EGLN1</i> modifications at the functional regions; however, led to significantly reduce PHD2 expression and increase HbF expression levels in severe β-thalassemia erythroblasts. Moreover, these beneficial phenotypes were independent to the two well-known HbF regulators including BCL11A and GATA1. Our findings introduce an additional mechanism for HbF regulation in β-thalassemia and propose that targeting the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway, particularly PHD2 functional domains, might offer a promising therapeutic strategy to β-thalassemia diseases."

According to the diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO), patients were divided into dengue fever group, dengue fever with warning signs group, and severe dengue fever group. The differences in clinical data between different groups of patients were analyzed and compared. Binary multiple factor Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors affecting the severity of dengue fever in patients. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to analyze the predictive value of prediction models constructed for various risk factors for severe dengue fever. Subgroup analysis was performed on the prognosis of severe dengue fever patients, and the differences in clinical data between two groups of patients with different prognoses were compared. Binary multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors affecting the prognosis of severe dengue fever patients. ROC curve was drawn to analyze the predictive value of prediction models constructed for various risk factors on the prognosis of severe dengue fever patients. A total of 2 264 patients were included, including 499 cases in the dengue fever group, 1 379 cases in the dengue fever with warning signs group, and 386 in the severe dengue fever group (43 deaths and 343 survivors). The most common symptom of dengue fever patients was fever (94.70%), followed by muscle soreness (70.54%), headache (63.12%), fatigue (58.92%), and chills (46.02%).

The levels of cTnT and myoglobin in patients with dengue fever with warning signs group were significantly higher than those in the dengue fever group, and the level of Alb in patients with dengue fever with warning signs group was significantly lower than that in the dengue fever group, the differences were statistically significant (all P < 0.05). Binary multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that thalassemia [odds ratio (OR) = 6.214, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 2.337-16.524, P < 0.001], Alb ≤ 36 g/L (OR = 6.297, 95%CI was 4.270-9.286, P < 0.001), and cTnT levels (OR = 1.008, 95%CI was 1.002-1.015, P = 0.016) were risk factors for severe dengue fever. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for predicting severe dengue fever based on the prediction models constructed for the above risk factors was 0.856, with the best predictive value of 0.067, sensitivity of 67.1%, and specificity of 99.4%. In the subgroup analysis of patients with severe dengue fever, compared with the survival group, the levels of hematocrit (HCT), cTnT, and CK-MB in the death group patients were significantly increased, while the level of Alb was significantly decreased, and the differences were statistically significant. Binary multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that Alb (OR = 0.839, 95%CI was 0.755-0.932, P = 0.001), HCT (OR = 1.086, 95%CI was 1.010-1.168, P = 0.025), elevated troponin level (OR = 10.119, 95%CI was 2.596-39.440, P < 0.001), and CK-MB (OR = 1.081, 95%CI was 1.032-1.133, P < 0.001) were risk factors for mortality in patients with severe dengue fever. ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC for predicting death in severe dengue fever patients based on the prediction models constructed for the above risk factors was 0.881, with the best predictive value of 0.113, sensitivity of 75.0%, and specificity of 88.9%.

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a prevalent monogenic blood disorder, clinically classified into alpha- and beta-thalassemia, characterized by the imbalance of the alpha- and beta-globin chains that constitute adult hemoglobin. Copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants in globin genes are the primary genetic defects causing thalassemia. During a prenatal examination, a pregnant woman was suspected to be a carrier of thalassemia, exhibiting microcytic hypochromic anemia and abnormal hemoglobin constituents. Gap-polymerase chain reaction (Gap-PCR) and reverse dot blot (PCR-RDB) techniques did not detect any common thalassemia mutations. We conducted hematological examination and further genetic analyses on the proband's family with three generations. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was employed to identify CNVs, targeted next-generation sequencing was used to screen for potential pathogenic variants, which were subsequently validated by Sanger sequencing. The hematological parameters of the proband, her father and her son all indicated they were beta-thalassemia carriers. MLPA results revealed a large deletion in beta-globin cluster. Further investigation confirmed the presence of a novel 8.2 kb deletion (NC_000011.10:g.5224208_5232469del) in the proband, her father, and her son, specifically covering the entire HBB gene while not impacting other globin genes. We found a novel 8.2 kb deletion leading to beta-thalassemia in a Chinese family in which three generations had been affected. This novel deletion may broaden the spectrum of known mutations in thalassemia and provide a reference for clinically suspected cases."

We previously reported that the HSV-1 encoded CTCF insulator located downstream of the LAT (CTRL2) controlled IE gene silencing during latency. To further characterize the role of this insulator during the lytic infection we leveraged a ΔCTRL2 recombinant virus to show that there was a genome replication defect that stemmed from decreased IE gene expression in fibroblasts and epithelial cells at early times following initiation of infection. Further experiments indicated that the defect in gene expression resulted from chromatin inaccessibility in the absence of the insulator. To elucidate how chromatin accessibility was altered in the absence of the CTRL2 insulator, we showed that enrichment of Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked chromatin remodeler (ATRX), and the histone variant H3.3, both of which are known for their roles in maintaining repressive histone markers on the HSV-1 viral genome were increased on IE regions of HSV-1. Finally, both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 repressive histone marks remained enriched by 4 hours post infection in the absence of the CTRL2 insulator, confirming that the CTRL2 insulator is required for de-repression of IE genes of viral genomes. To our knowledge these are the first data that show that a specific CTCF insulator in the HSV-1 genome (CTRL2) regulates chromatin accessibility during the lytic infection."

    "abstract": "Thalassemic osteopathy includes low bone mass and impaired bone microarchitecture. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and determinants of bone quantity (osteoporosis) and quality (microarchitecture) in a cohort of adult patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). Patients with TDT (<i>n</i> = 63) and age- and BMI-matched controls (<i>n</i> = 63) were recruited in the study. Areal bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using DXA Hologic scanner. P1NP and β-CTX were estimated by electrochemiluminescence assay. Bone geometry and volumetric BMD (vBMD) were estimated by second-generation high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Bone turnover marker β-CTX was significantly lower in the TDT group, but there was no difference in P1NP levels. Low bone mass (Z ≤ -2) was present in greater proportion of patients both at lumbar spine (LS) (54 vs 0%; <i>p</i> = .001) and femoral neck (FN) (33 vs 8%; <i>p</i> = .001). Hypogonadism was associated with low BMD at FN (OR 10.0; 95% CI, 1.2-86; <i>p</i> = .01) and low hemoglobin with low BMD at LS (OR 1.58; 95% CI, 0.96-2.60; <i>p</i> = .07). The mean trabecular bone score was also significantly lower in patients compared with controls (1.261 ± 0.072 vs 1.389 ± 0.058). Total, cortical and trabecular vBMD were significantly lower in cases than controls. The trabecular number and cortical thickness were significantly lower and trabecular separation higher in cases than controls. Adults with TDT have significantly lower areal, cortical and trabecular vBMD. The bone microarchitecture is also significantly impaired in terms of lower number and wider spacing of trabeculae as well as lower cortical thickness and area at both radius and tibia."

    "abstract": "CMRtools is a software package that can be used to measure T2* values to diagnose liver iron overload, however, its accuracy in terms is affected by multiple factors, including goodness-of-fit (R<sup>2</sup> value), the number of echo time (TE) images, and the liver iron concentration (LIC). To investigate the effects of the R<sup>2</sup> value, the number of TE images, and the LIC on the accuracy of CMRtools software for measuring T2* values to diagnose liver iron overload (LIO). CMRtools software was used to measure liver T2* values among 108 thalassemia patients via the truncation method, and the R<sup>2</sup> values, the number of TE images, and T2* values were recorded. These values were subsequently converted into liver iron concentration (LIC<sub>T</sub>) values. The LIC<sub>F</sub> (derived from MRI-R2/FerriScan) was used as a reference, and the diagnostic accordance rate (DAR) was compared between R<sup>2</sup> value subgroups, between TE image number subgroups, and between LIC subgroups. The greater the R<sup>2</sup> value was, the greater the standardized DAR (SDAR) was (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The SDAR are not identical between each TE image number subgroup (<i>p</i> > 0.05). However, the relationship between TE image number subgroups and SDAR was analysed using Spearman's correlation, and it was found to be positively correlated (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.729, <i>p</i> = 0.017). The SDAR are not identical between each LIC subgroup (<i>p</i> > 0.05), furthermore, the relationship between LIC subgroup and SDAR was found irrelevant (<i>p</i> = 0.747). The accuracy of CMRtools software for diagnosing LIO in patients with thalassemia can be improved by artificially controlling the number of TE images to be fitted and selecting higher R<sup>2</sup> values."

    "abstract": "Transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) is a genetic disorder characterized by low haemoglobin levels, often leading to myocardial iron overload (MIO) and myocardial fibrosis (MF). Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) represents the gold standard for MIO and MF assessment, although its limited availability and high costs pose challenges. Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain (LV GLS) measured by Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) could offer a valuable alternative. A monocentric diagnostic accuracy study was conducted to compare the performance of LV GLS with CMR using T2* for evaluating MIO and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) for detecting MF. Between January 2022 and January 2023, 44 consecutive patients with TDT were enrolled. For each participant was performed LV GLS with STE, including CMR with T2* technique and LGE sequences. CMR identified MIO in 8 patients (18 %) and MF in 5 (11 %). LV GLS STE was normal in patients without MIO (-20.6 ± 3.1 %) or MF (-20.6 ± 2.8 %), significantly differing from those with MIO (-18.2 ± 2.1 %, p = 0.043) and MF (-16.4 ± 1.7 %, p = 0.002). ROC analysis indicated an optimal LV GLS STE cutoff of -19.8 % for MIO (AUC = 0.76, 95 % CI: 0.59-0.93, p = 0.054) with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 64 % and an optimal cutoff of -18.3 % for MF (AUC = 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.85-1.00, p = 0.009) with an accuracy of 86 %. The findings of this pilot study indicate that LV GLS with STE, may be a cost-effective screening tool for the early detection of MIO and MF in TDT patients."

    "abstract": "The T2* technique, used for quantifying myocardial iron content (MIC), has limitations in detecting early myocardial iron overload (MIO). The in vivo mapping of the myocardial T1 relaxation time is a promising alternative for the early detection and management of MIO. 32 β-thalassemia major (βTM) patients aged 11.5 ± 4 years and 32 healthy controls were recruited and underwent thorough clinical and laboratory assessments. The mid-level septal iron overload was measured through T1 mapping using a modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence with a 3 (3 s) 3 (3 s) 5 scheme. Septum was divided at the mentioned level into 3 zones corresponding to segments 8 and 9 in the cardiac segmentation model. 21.9 % of βTM had clinical cardiac morbidity. The cut-off of T1 mapping of hepatic and myocardium to differentiate between the patients and control groups was ≤466 and ≥ 923 ms respectively. The T1 technique was able to detect 4 patients with high MIC, two of them were not detected by the T2* technique. There was a statistically significant correlation between the average T1 values of the studied zones in patients with βTM and the liver iron content (LIC), the T1 values within segment 8 of the liver, age of patients, the age at first transfusion, age of splenectomy and serum ferritin value. The addition of the T1 mapping sequence to the conventional T2* technique was able to increase the efficacy of the MIC detection protocol by earlier detection of MIO. This would guide chelation therapy to decrease myocardial morbidity."

Recent studies indicate MMS occurs due to a combination of genetic modifiers and causative mutations for the primary genetic disorders. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 13 patients with various genetic disorders who developed MMS. WES successfully revealed the genetic diagnoses of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), Down syndrome, multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and alpha thalassemia. The previously reported modifier genes, RNF213 and MRVI1, were confirmed in the NF-1 and Down syndrome cases. Further analysis revealed rare hypomorphic variants in the causative genes of the primary disorders underlying MMS, such as Alagille syndrome and Rasopathies, conferred susceptibility to MMS. Genes involved in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), such as ABCC8 and BMPR2, were also identified as potential modifiers. The rare variants in the MMS and PAH genes were significantly enriched in the eight Japanese patients with MMS compared with the 104 Japanese individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Disease genes associated with the arterial occlusive conditions represented by those of Rasopathies and PAH may provide novel diagnostic markers and future therapeutic targets for MMS as well as moyamoya disease with an unknown cause."

These syndromes show a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, such as distinctive dysmorphic features, mild-to-profound intellectual disability, motor development delay, seizures, urogenital abnormalities, and gastrointestinal disorders. A 3-year-old boy from a Chinese non-consanguineous family was diagnosed with MRXHF1 by whole-exome sequencing. Comprehensive family history information was obtained. The Medline database was searched until 1st Aug 2023 for articles related to ATRX pathogenic variant. Data on gene/protein mutations and clinical symptoms were extracted. The proband showed intellectual disability, motor development delay, typical facial abnormalities, urogenital defect, behavior problems, and optical nerve dysplasia. A novel frameshift mutation c.399_400dup, (p.Leu134Cysfs*2) in the ATRX gene was the primary cause, which occurs right before the ATRXDNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain of ATRX protein. Missense mutation is the most common variation type. The ADD and helicase-like domains are the most frequently affected domains. Epilepsy, congenital heart disease, urogenital defect, acoustic defect, and optical defect are more prevalent in patients with frameshift mutations compared to those with missense mutations. There are more urogenital defects with C-terminal frameshift mutations than with N-terminal frameshift mutations. We described a novel frameshift mutation in the ATRX gene in a patient with MRXHF1 syndrome and summarized the genotype-phenotype relationship of ATRX pathogenic variant by variation type and affected protein domain. The regulatory mechanism underlying ATRX variant requires comprehensive analysis in future studies."

Members of the Transfusion Medicine and Hematology faculty at our institution collaborated in an iterative process to produce a consensus approach to patients with HHS. We present diagnostic criteria for HHS: recent transfusion within past 7 days (up to 21 days), rapid hemoglobin decline to below the pretransfusion level (usually hemoglobin drop >25% from pretransfusion), a significant decrease in HbA% (in patients with sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia), low or decreasing reticulocyte count in a patient with worsening anemia, and laboratory evidence of hemolysis. We also describe an in-depth approach to management focusing on optimizing hematopoiesis while dampening the immune response. We provide a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and management of HHS based on contemporary literature and clinical experience designed to optimize outcomes for patients."

These tests are based on specific variant profile in the regions of the testing centers. De novo mutations and migration change the distribution of these variants. We aim to update the variant spectrum in the <i>HBB</i> gene in our region. In addition, we present a variant, which not been detected before in Turkey, and also a changed classification of another variant. This study includes 142 patients (46 of Turkish, 96 of Syrian) who were investigated for defects in their β-globin gene with Sanger sequencing. Clinically, 52 of these patients had thalassemia major, and 90 had thalassemia minor. Twenty three types of pathogenic variants were identified causing beta thalassemia and abnormal hemoglobins. Variant distribution has differed considerably between Turkish and Syrian patients. While the IVSI-110G>A was the most prevalent variant (41.1%) in Turkish patients, the IVSII-1G>A and Codon 39 (C>T) variants were found in 22% and 21.3%, respectively, in Syrian patients. We detected the novel c.31_32insT variant in 3 Syrian patients. The detection of updated regional <i>HBB</i> variant spectrum will contribute to future prenatal and/or postnatal molecular diagnostic tests.

To assess the prevalence of myocardial involvement in β-TI patients by T2* relaxometry and native T1 and T2 mapping and to determine the correlation of myocardial relaxation times with demographic and clinical parameters. Prospective matched-cohort study. 42 β-TI patients (27 females, 39.65 ± 12.32 years), enrolled in the Extension-Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassaemia Network, and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (27 females, 40.01 ± 11.36 years) and thalassemia major (TM) patients (27 females, 39.27 ± 11.57 years). 1.5 T/multi-echo gradient echo, modified Look-Locker inversion recovery, multi-echo fast-spin-echo, cine balanced steady-state-free precession, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences. Hepatic, pancreatic, and left ventricular (LV) T2* values, LV native T1 and T2 values, biventricular ejection fractions and volumes, and presence and extent of replacement myocardial fibrosis. Comparisons between two groups were performed with two-sample t tests, Wilcoxon's signed rank tests, or χ<sup>2</sup> testing. Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson's or Spearman's test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. β-TI patients had significantly higher LV T2 values than healthy subjects (56.84 ± 4.03 vs. 52.46 ± 2.50 msec, P < 0.0001) and significantly higher LV T1 values than TM patients (1018.32 ± 48.94 vs. 966.66 ± 66.47 msec, P < 0.0001). In β-TI, female gender was associated with significantly increased LV T1 (P = 0.041) and T2 values (P < 0.0001), while splenectomy and presence of regular transfusions were associated with significantly lower LV T1 values (P = 0.014 and P = 0.001, respectively). In β-TI patients, all LV relaxation times were significantly correlated with each other (T2*-T1: P = 0.003; T2*-T2: P = 0.003; T1-T2: P < 0.0001). Two patients with a reduced LV T2* also had a reduced LV T1, while only one had a reduced LV T2. Three patients had a reduced LV T1 but a normal LV T2*; 66.7% of the patients had an increased LV T2. All LV relaxation times were significantly correlated with pancreas T2* values (T2*: P = 0.033; T1: P < 0.0001; T2: P = 0.014). No LV relaxation time was associated (P > 0.05) with hepatic iron concentration, biventricular function parameters, or LGE presence. The combined use of all three myocardial relaxation times has potential to improve sensitivity in the detection of early/subclinical myocardial involvement in β-Tl patients. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2."

This review aimed to furnish clinicians with the latest clinical outcomes associated with apixaban and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in managing AF patients on dialysis. Literature from the PubMed and Embase databases up to March 2024 underwent systematic scrutiny for inclusion. The results were narratively summarized. Six studies were included in this review, comprising the AXADIA-AFNET 8 study, the RENAL-AF trial, and four observational studies. In a French nationwide observational study, patients initiated on apixaban demonstrated a diminished risk of thromboembolic events (hazard ratios [HR]: 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-0.78) compared to those on VKAs. A retrospective review with a 2-year follow-up, encompassing patients with AF and ESKD on hemodialysis, evidenced no statistical difference in the risk of symptomatic bleeding and stroke between the apixaban and warfarin groups. Two retrospective studies based on the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) database both indicated no statistical difference between apixaban and VKAs in the risk of thromboembolic events. One study reported that apixaban correlated with a reduced risk of major bleeding relative to warfarin (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.87), while the other study suggested that apixaban was associated with a decreased risk of mortality compared to warfarin (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.78-0.92). The AXADIA-AFNET 8 study found no differences between apixaban and VKAs in safety or effectiveness outcomes for AF patients on dialysis. The RENAL-AF trial, however, was deemed inadequate for drawing conclusions due to its small sample size. Currently, the published studies generally support that apixaban exhibits non-inferior safety and effectiveness outcomes compared to VKAs for AF patients on dialysis."

World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 classification introduced Grade (G)3 neuroendocrine tumor (NET) distinct from neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), based on molecular differences and to triage the patients for appropriate therapy. This distinction largely relies on morphology, which can be challenging at times. Genomic profiling has revealed TP53 and RB1 mutations in NECs, while death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX) and alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX), in G3NET. Their role as biological markers in differentiating these entities and their significance as prognostic markers are not yet established. This study aims at analyzing the diagnostic and prognostic role of p53 and ATRX in neuroendocrine neoplasms of GIT and pancreas. A single-centre, eight-year retrospective study of neuroendocrine neoplasm of GIT and pancreas comprised G2NET, G3NET and NEC. Tumor slides were stained by immunohistochemistry for p53 and ATRX. Strong nuclear staining of > 50% of tumor cells for p53 was considered mutated. Nuclear staining of ATRX in < 5% of tumor cells was considered ATRX loss. Expression of p53 and ATRX was analyzed and correlated with tumor grades and patient survival. Fifty-five patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm were studied, comprising G2NET (58%), G3NET (16%) and NEC (26%). Median age of diagnosis was 59 years with male predominance. The pancreas was the most common site followed by the small bowel. NEC showed lower survival compared to G3 and G2NET. Mutated p53 immunohistochemical expression was more frequent among NEC than G3NET. Patients with mutated p53 had significantly lower survival irrespective of the grade (p = 0.001). There was no association of ATRX loss with grade or survival. G3NETs are genetically different from NECs. Use of immunohistochemistry for p53 in addition to histomorphology may facilitate accurate categorization of NEC and G3NET. Mutated p53 may also be used as an independent prognostic marker in neuroendocrine tumors of GIT and pancreas."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia(β-TH) is an inherited hemoglobin disorder marked by ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, splenomegaly, and systemic iron overload, predominantly affecting developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite extensive research on its pathogenesis, the interactions between gut microbiota and metabolites in β-TH remain poorly understood. This study compares fecal metabolomics and metagenomics between wildtype (Wt) and heterozygous Th3/+ mice, a model for non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia intermedia. Our results show increased intestinal bilirubin metabolism, with significant elevations in metabolites such as biliverdin, bilirubin, and stercobilin. Metagenomic analysis revealed notable differences in bacterial composition between Th3/+ and Wt mice. Specifically, Cupriavidus metallidurans was identified as a key bacterium that mitigates anemia by reducing liver and spleen iron deposition. This is the first study to ameliorate anemia in mice by altering gut microbiota, presenting new strategies for β-TH management."

    "title": "Risk Factors for Anemia in Adolescent Pregnancies: Evidence From the Lembah Pantai Urban Health District in Malaysia.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Adolescent pregnant mothers are at higher risk of acquiring anemia during pregnancy, which has detrimental consequences for the mother and baby. Untreated and prolonged anemia can lead to perinatal morbidity and mortality and antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum maternal morbidity. Anemia among adolescent pregnant mothers can be attributed to many factors, such as poor nutrition and the physiological demands of pregnancy. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anemia among adolescent pregnancies in Lembah Pantai Health District in an urban setting. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from registry records of adolescent pregnant mothers in the Lembah Pantai District Health Office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 2019 to 2022. All adolescent pregnancies aged 10 to 19 years were included in this study. Those with a prior diagnosis of thalassemia or other hematological disorders, as indicated in their medical records, were excluded from the study. The chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test was applied to elicit the association at a univariate level, and those variables with a p-value of <0.25 were included in a multiple logistic regression model. Results A total of 307 records were reviewed, and 272 pregnant adolescent cases were eligible for the analyses. The prevalence of anemia among teenage pregnancies from 2019 to 2022 was 28.7% (95% CI: 23.0-33.6). This prevalence was lower than in many lower-income countries and developing countries. Factors that were significant on using multiple logistic regression analysis included marital status (unmarried) (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.01-3.45, p=0.046), residing area Seputeh (AOR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.14-0.61, p=0.001), and third trimester of first antenatal visit/booking (AOR: 5.08, 95% CI: 2.02-12.70, p<0.001). The population in the Seputeh area has a higher overall household income in comparison to Lembah Pantai. Conclusions According to the WHO classification, the prevalence of anemia among adolescent pregnant women at the Lembah Pantai District Health Office reflects a moderate public health issue. Consequently, anemia may exacerbate the impact of other health conditions in this population. Hence, local health authorities should ensure that anemia is adequately addressed without ignoring other crucial health issues. A multidisciplinary, comprehensive, holistic strategy involving healthcare providers, school health teams, and community assets offers a potential solution. Strategies that can be employed include providing targeted health and nutrition education in schools through school health teams. Additionally, establishing adolescent-friendly health clinics tailored to the specific needs of pregnant adolescents and enhancing antenatal services to ensure comprehensive screening and management of anemia should also be implemented. Hence, this will ensure achieving safe motherhood goals through an effective healthcare response."

    "title": "Potential Use of MicroRNA Technology in Thalassemia Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Thalassemia encompasses a group of inherited hemoglobin disorders characterized by reduced or absent production of the α- or β-globin chains, leading to anemia and other complications. Current management relies on lifelong blood transfusions and iron chelation, which is burdensome for patients. This review summarizes the emerging therapeutic potential of modulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to treat thalassemia. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through sequence-specific binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While they commonly repress gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, miRNAs can also interact with 5'UTRs and gene promoters to activate gene expression. Many miRNAs are now recognized as critical regulators of erythropoiesis and are abnormally expressed in β-thalassemia. Therapeutically restoring levels of deficient miRNAs or inhibiting overexpression through miRNA mimics or inhibitors (antagomir), respectively, has shown preclinical efficacy in ameliorating thalassemic phenotypes. The miR-144/451 cluster is especially compelling for targeted upregulation to reactivate fetal hemoglobin synthesis. Advances in delivery systems are addressing previous challenges in stability and targeting of miRNA-based drugs. While still early, gene therapy studies suggest combinatorial approaches with miRNA modulation may provide synergistic benefits. Several key considerations remain including enhancing delivery, minimizing off-target effects, and demonstrating long-term safety and efficacy. While no miRNA therapies have yet progressed to clinical testing for thalassemia specifically, important lessons are being learned through clinical trials for other diseases and conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and viral. If limitations can be overcome through multi-disciplinary collaboration, miRNAs hold great promise to expand and transform treatment options for thalassemia in the future by precisely targeting pathogenic molecular networks. Ongoing innovations, such as advancements in miRNA delivery systems, improved targeting mechanisms, and enhanced understanding of miRNA biology, continue to drive progress in this emerging field towards realizing the clinical potential of miRNA-based medicines for thalassemia patients."

A retrospective study was carried out on five individuals identified by the People's Hospital of Yangjiang and Guangzhou Hybribio Co., Ltd. from May 2018 to September 2022. Routine blood test and hemoglobin electrophoresis were performed, and the genotypes of five subjects were determined by using PCR combined with reverse dot blotting (RDB), nested PCR, Gap-PCR and Sanger sequencing. This study was approved by the People's Hospital of Yangjiang (Ethics No. 20240001). Among the five individuals, hematological data of one was unavailable, and the remaining four had presented with microcytosis and hypochromia. The results of hemoglobin electrophoresis indicated that all of them had a HbA2 level of ≥4.7%. Genetic analysis showed that one case had harbored compound heterozygous mutations of ααα<sup>anti3.7</sup> triplet and HBB: c.93-21G＞A, one had compound heterozygous mutations of -α<sup>3.7</sup> and HBB: c.93-21G＞A, whilst the remaining three were heterozygous for the HBB: c.93-21G＞A mutation. The hematological phenotype of β-thalassemia carriers (HBB: c.93-21G＞A) is similar to that of other β<sup>+</sup> thalassemia heterozygotes with mild β-thalassemia characteristics."

It primarily promotes RNA stability, regulates translation and RNA localization, and mediates gene expression through its downstream effectors. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IGF2BP1 plays crucial roles in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. IGF2BP1-modulated cell proliferation, invasion, and chemo-resistance in solid tumors have attracted researchers' attention. Additionally, several studies have highlighted the importance of IGF2BP1 in hematologic malignancies and hematological genetic diseases, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for hematological disorders. However, there is a lack of systematic summaries regarding the IGF2BP1 gene within the hematological field. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the discovery and molecular structure of IGF2BP1, along with recent studies on its role in regulating embryogenesis. We also focus on the mechanisms by which IGF2BP1 regulates hematological malignancies through its interactions with its targeted mRNAs. Furthermore, we systematically elucidate the function and mechanism of IGF2BP1 in promoting fetal hemoglobin expression in adult hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of IGF2BP1 as a therapeutic target, offering insights into its prospects."

    "title": "Vamifeport: Monography of the First Oral Ferroportin Inhibitor.",
    "abstract": "Over the last few years, several mechanisms that are involved in congenital diseases characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis have been described. Therefore, multiple new target drugs are being developed in preclinical models against the main regulators of normal erythropoiesis. Above all, the key mechanism that regulates systemic iron homeostasis, represented by the hepcidin-ferroportin axis, is considered to be the target for new therapies. The main hypothesis is that iron restriction, through blocking ferroportin (the unique iron transporter in mammals) in such diseases, ameliorates erythropoiesis. The action of vamifeport is different from the currently approved drugs in this setting since it acts straight on the ferroportin-hepcidin axis. The data presented in the sickle cell disease (SCD) Townes mouse model showed a preclinical proof-of-concept for the efficacy of oral ferroportin inhibitor. Vamifeport reduced hemoglobin concentration in red blood cells (RBCs) and diminished intravascular hemolysis and inflammation, improving hemodynamics and preventing vascular occlusive crises. On this basis, clinical trials were commenced in patients with SCD, non-transfusion-dependent (NTD) thalassemia and transfusion-dependent (TD) thalassemia. Preliminary data in NTD thalassemic patients also confirm the safety and efficacy in decreasing iron level. In conclusion, vamifeport represents a new option in the panorama of drugs targeting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis, but its efficacy is still under investigation as a single agent."

    "abstract": "We retrospectively collected all ultrasound imaging data of our thalassemia patients over a period of 10 years with the aim of assessing the prevalence and the risk factors of renal stones and cysts. Moreover, we assessed the incidence of renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) among thalassemia patients (133 with thalassemia major (TM) and 157 with thalassemia intermedia (TI)) and its association with demographic and clinical findings. Renal stones were detected in 15.2% of patients. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, the independent predictors were blood consumption, splenectomy, and proteinuria. Renal cysts were detected in 18.4% of patients. In the multivariable analysis, age emerged as the only independent predictor. After the first detection, 35% of the patients showed changes in the number, size, or grading of renal cysts. During the study period, the crude incidence rate of RCC was 75.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. The most frequent histological subtype (80%) included clear-cell RCC. In total, 80% of patients with RCC had TM and all were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Thalassemia patients are significantly affected by asymptomatic renal diseases such as stones, cysts, and cancer, suggesting the need for regular screening by imaging."

    "abstract": "The regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in red blood cells (RBCs) is crucial for maintaining functionality and lifespan. Indeed, dysregulated ROS occurs in haematological diseases such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassaemia. In order to combat this, RBCs possess high levels of protective antioxidant enzymes. We aimed to further boost RBC antioxidant capacity by overexpressing peroxiredoxin (Prxs) and glutathione peroxidase (GPxs) enzymes. Multiple antioxidant enzyme cDNAs were individually overexpressed in expanding immortalised erythroblasts using lentivirus, including Prx isoforms 1, 2, and 6 and GPx isoforms 1 and 4. Enhancing Prx protein expression proved straightforward, but GPx overexpression required modifications. For GPx4, these modifications included adding a SECIS element in the 3'UTR, the removal of a mitochondrial-targeting sequence, and removing putative ubiquitination sites. Culture-derived reticulocytes exhibiting enhanced levels of Prx and GPx antioxidant proteins were successfully engineered, demonstrating a novel approach to improve RBC resilience to oxidative stress. Further work is needed to explore the activity of these proteins and their impact on RBC metabolism, but this strategy shows promise for improving RBC function in physiological and pathological contexts and during storage for transfusion. Enhancing the antioxidant capacity of reticulocytes has exciting promise for developing culture-derived RBCs with enhanced resistance to oxidative damage and offers new therapeutic interventions in diseases with elevated oxidative stress."

    "abstract": "To assess the immunization efficacy and incidence of adverse reactions after hepatitis B vaccination in children with thalassemia based on data from real-world studies. A total of 625 children were recruited into this cross-sectional study. Subgroup analyses of different thalassemia types were performed using binary logistic regression, the factors affecting HBsAb levels were identified using multiple linear regression, and the dose-response relationship between the duration of immunization and seroconversion was explored using the restricted cubic spline (RCS) model to further assess the protective duration of the hepatitis B vaccine. HBsAb positivity in enrolled children was 87.3% in the thalassemia group and 81.4% in the control group. Multifactorial analysis revealed that the duration of immunization, age at completion of vaccination, and whether the first dose was delayed were significant factors influencing HBsAb levels in children (P < 0.05). The threshold for HBsAb positivity may be reached when the immunization duration reaches approximately 30 months. A subgroup analysis revealed that the HBsAb positivity rate was lower in children with β-thalassemia minor compared to those with α-thalassemia minor (P = 0.001, 95% CI: 0.097 ∼ 0.536). Adverse reactions after hepatitis B vaccination were dominated by general reactions, with a statistically significant difference in injection-site redness and swelling between the thalassemia and control groups (P < 0.05). The immunization response to the hepatitis B vaccine in children with thalassemia minor was comparable to healthy children, with no abnormal adverse effects seen."

Genotype-phenotype association studies have confirmed that platelet traits are quantitatively regulated by multiple genes. However, there is currently a lack of genetic studies on the heterogeneity of platelet traits in β-thalassemia under hypercoagulable state. Here, we studied the phenotypic heterogeneity of platelet count (PLT) and mean platelet volume (MPV) in 1020 β-thalassemia patients. We further performed a functionally informed whole genome sequencing association analysis of common variants and rare variants (RVs) for PLT and MPV in 916 patients through integrative analysis of whole-genome sequencing data and functional annotation data. Extreme phenotypic heterogeneity of platelet traits was observed in β-thalassemia patients. Additionally, the common variant based gene-level analysis identified the novel gene of RNF144B associated with MPV. The RV analysis identified several novel associations in both coding and noncoding genome, including missense RVs of PPP2R5C associated with PLT and missense RVs of TSSK1B associated with MPV. In conclusion, we performed a comprehensive and systematic whole genome scan of platelet traits in the β-thalassemia cohort, demonstrating the specificity of genetic regulation of platelet traits in the context of β-thalassemia, providing potential targets for intervention."

    "abstract": "Infertility is a common issue that threatens couples worldwide. Infertility can result from the male or female partner alone, or both partners. It can be due to multiple factors related to the patient's overall health or lifestyle. Causes related to patient health can be systemic or related to gonadal dysfunction. One of the systematic causes can be hematological. The two most common hemoglobinopathies that are thought to cause infertility, especially male infertility, are sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia major (TM). These two hemoglobinopathies cause male infertility through pathophysiological alterations. Specifically, they alter the oxygen carrying ability of red blood cells (RBCs), causing tissue hypoxia that affects the normal physiological process of spermatogenesis, eventually inducing infertility. Semen analyses and other systemic blood testing can be used to investigate male infertility. Both hemoglobinopathies can be helped by blood transfusions, which can then alleviate male infertility. This paper aims to explore the relationship between hemoglobinopathies (SCD and TM) and their role in contributing to male infertility, in addition to the role of blood transfusions in addressing male infertility by correcting the root cause."

N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) is an established biomarker for ventricular dysfunction in heart failure (HF). This case-control study examined the relationship between brain natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) levels and complete blood count (CBC) parameters in HF patients and healthy controls, exploring the utility of CBC as a supplementary diagnostic tool for HF. The study included 89 participants, divided into 42 HF patients with diagnosed HF (patient group) and 47 healthy individuals (control group). Pro-BNP levels were measured alongside a comprehensive CBC panel, including parameters such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and platelet count. Demographic, clinical characteristics, and CBC parameters were compared between the two groups, with statistical analyses performed to identify any significant associations. The analysis demonstrated that HF patients had significantly higher Pro-BNP levels than the control subjects, indicating a strong association between Pro-BNP levels and HF (1052.65 [196.56] vs. 2500.34 [1105.90], <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, significant differences in CBC parameters, such as platelet count: 246.96 (82.72) versus 206.45 (57.20), <i>p</i> = 0.009; mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 83.74 (5.86) versus 87.12 (4.60), <i>p</i> < 0.00; and red cell distribution width: 13.47 (1.29) versus 14.28 (1.35), <i>p</i> < 0.001) were observed, with the patient group showing altered levels indicative of cardiac stress and inflammation. Correlation analysis further established the relationship between Pro-BNP levels and CBC parameters, with notable correlations observed with MCV (0.250, <i>p</i> < 0.020) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels (0.246, <i>p</i> < 0.045). These findings suggest a complex interplay between Pro-BNP levels and CBC parameters, underscoring the potential of CBC parameters as auxiliary diagnostic markers in HF. Pro-BNP exhibits clinical relevance in diagnosing cardiovascular dysfunction, with elevated levels and distinct hematological profiles in HF patients. Pro-BNP's diagnostic and predictive capabilities for hematocrit and platelet count support its use in risk assessment and treatment decisions for HF."

    "abstract": "Introduction Children with thalassemia often require repeated invasive treatments and frequent hospitalizations, resulting in pain, anxiety, and altered vital signs. Implementing non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and inexpensive complementary practices can benefit both the child and their family. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the impact of foot reflexology versus simple massage on vital signs, anxiety, and pain induced by blood transfusions in children with thalassemia. Materials and methods An experimental study was conducted on 60 children with thalassemia; children aged 2-13 years were selected by systematic random sampling. The participants were separated into two groups: 30 children received foot reflexology and 30 children received a simple massage. Data were collected using a self-structured demographic profile, vital signs record sheet, standard Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) scale, and visual analog scale (VAS). Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions. The chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the relationship between demographic and dependent variables. Result Foot reflexology showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in anxiety and pain. The simple massage group showed a significant effect on temperature, anxiety, and pain. Both groups demonstrated a significant impact (P < 0.05) on systolic blood pressure and pain after the intervention. Conclusion Most children were diagnosed with thalassemia during infancy, had a history of both parent's thalassemia minor, and were Rh+ve. Foot reflexology was more effective in reducing anxiety and pain than simple massage. Additionally, foot reflexology had a significant effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while simple massage significantly affected temperature in children with thalassemia."

To assess the clinical and laboratory characteristics of beta-thalassemia patients presenting with hypertriglyceridemia and its correlation with the pre-transfusion hemoglobin level. Methods: This hospital record-based retrospective study was conducted at the Dr B C Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences, Kolkata, India. The study comprised 12 pediatric beta-thalassemia patients whose plasma appeared milky or chylous during a complete hemogram. Clinical examination and laboratory investigations were done to describe their clinico-laboratory features. A whole exome sequencing was carried out to assess their genetic background. Blood hemoglobin and serum triglyceride estimation was carried out initially and at follow-up to determine any correlation between the two. Results: Out of 1482 patients, 12 (0.80 %) were diagnosed with Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome. The median age of presentation was 12.5 months (Q1:10 months, Q3:14 months)., and the pretransfusion hemoglobin was 4.82 ± 1.16 g/dL. The lipid profile showed a triglyceride level of 858.3 ± 198.4 mg/dl and a total cholesterol level of 117.4 ± 16.15 mg/dl. Analysis revealed that the triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with the pretransfusion hemoglobin level (repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) = -0.65, 95% CI [-0.794, -0.425], p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Hemolytic anemia is characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells, a condition that ranges from chronic to life-threatening. Hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs) encompass a broad spectrum of disorders including hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, and membrane disorders. In India, hemoglobinopathies, notably thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are significant health concerns contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite many cases being clinically insignificant, these disorders exert a considerable public health burden due to their prevalence. Techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have emerged as powerful tools for identifying and diagnosing HHAs. NGS enables comprehensive genetic analysis, pinpointing mutations associated with hemoglobinopathies and other forms of hereditary anemia. HPLC allows precise quantification and characterization of hemoglobin variants, which is crucial for diagnosing hemoglobinopathies. This study aimed to establish a refined approach for diagnosing hemolytic anemias and categorize different types of hemolytic anemia using state-of-the-art technologies for early and precise treatment interventions. This retrospective study was conducted in the Hematology Section of the Department of Pathology at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government Medical College, Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh. The study included six patients diagnosed with hemolytic anemia based on comprehensive hematological, biochemical, and molecular evaluations. Results: The retrospective analysis of six cases of hemolytic anemia highlighted the diagnostic approach utilized. Clinical presentations, physical examinations, routine hematological investigations, advanced diagnostic modalities, and hemoglobin electrophoresis were instrumental in identifying specific types of hemolytic anemias. Despite the availability of advanced diagnostic techniques, basic hematological investigations remain the cornerstone in the initial evaluation of HHAs. Hemoglobin electrophoresis plays a pivotal role in confirming diagnoses. In some cases, subtle hematological findings necessitate thorough evaluation, including familial studies, to guide appropriate management strategies."

Mounting evidence suggests that genetic disorders contribute. Scarce data exist regarding the prevalence of genetic disorders and their contribution to morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the proportion of genetic disorders in early preterm small for gestational age infants (with and without congenital anomalies) compared to early preterm appropriate for gestational age infants and the association of genetic disorders with morbidity or mortality. This is a retrospective cohort study of infants delivered at 23 and 0/7 to 33 and 6/7 weeks of gestation from 2000 to 2020 from the Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse. Data included diagnosed genetic disorders and congenital anomalies, baseline characteristics, and morbidity or mortality. We excluded cases of death in the delivery room before neonatal intensive care unit admission, multiple gestations, and cases transferred after birth or before death or discharge. We identified 223,431 early preterm infants, including 21,180 small for gestational age. Genetic disorders were present in 441 (2.3%) of small for gestational age infants without congenital anomalies, in 194 (10.8%) of small for gestational age infants with congenital anomalies, and in 304 (4.5%) of small for gestational age infants that experienced morbidity or mortality (with or without congenital anomalies). Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 were the most prevalent genetic disorders in these groups, together accounting for 145 small for gestational age infants without congenital anomalies, 117 small for gestational age infants with congenital anomalies, and 166 small for gestational age infants with morbidity or mortality (with or without congenital anomalies). Less prevalent genetic disorders consisted of other aneuploidy (45, X and 47, XXY), copy number variants (13q14 deletion syndrome, cri du chat syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome), and single gene disorders (cystic fibrosis, Fanconi anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemophilia, hypophosphatasia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia). Comparatively, genetic disorders were found in 1792 (1.0%) appropriate for gestational age infants without congenital anomalies, in 572 (5.8%) appropriate for gestational age infants with congenital anomalies, and 809 (2.0%) appropriate for gestational age infants that experienced morbidity or mortality (with or without congenital anomalies). Genetic disorders were associated with an adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.10 (1.89-2.33) of isolated small for gestational age and 12.84 (11.47-14.35) of small for gestational age accompanied by congenital anomalies. Genetic disorders were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.24 (1.83-2.74) of morbidity or mortality. These findings suggest that genetic disorders are more prevalent in early preterm small for gestational age infants, particularly those with congenital anomalies. These findings also suggest that genetic disorders are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. These associations were primarily driven by trisomies 13, 18, and 21. Genetic diagnoses in this cohort were made through routine clinical care, principally via karyotype, chromosomal microarray, and single gene testing. These findings support evolving clinical guidelines for genetic testing of small for gestational age infants. Our study is limited due to the lack of prospective, genome-wide testing."

A two-sample t-test and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-test were used to compare the changes in knowledge, attitude, and practice. Using paired samples t-test to compare the pre- and postcounseling outcome showed significant (P < 0.001) elevation in terms of knowledge, attitude, social beliefs, social discomfort, and practice as a thalassemia carrier. Further, ANOVA F-test demonstrates the relationship between demography and the difference in parametric score of the pre- and postcounseling outcome. By improving knowledge and attitudes, counseling can help individuals to better understand their condition and the importance of adhering to treatment recommendations. This can lead to improved health outcomes and a better quality of life for affected individuals."

    "title": "Effectiveness of educational intervention on quality of life in adults with thalassemia major: A quasi-experimental study based on PRECEDE model.",
    "abstract": "Due to the adverse effects of their disease, patients with thalassemia major face many problems such as a lack of proper growth, enlarged spleen and liver, bone disorders, especially the bones of the head and face. As a result of the long treatment process of this disease, other aspects of their life are also affected. The physical and mental problems in this population of patients will lead to frustration and lower social performance and quality of life. The present study aimed to explore the effect of an educational intervention based on the PRECEDE model on quality of life of adults with thalassemia major in Hormozgan province. The present quasi-experimental study was conducted on 234 adults with major thalassemia who visited the thalassemia medical centers in Hormozgan province in 2022. The participants were selected through a simple randomization from two cities of Hormozgan province (Bandar Abbas as the intervention group and Minab as the control). Each group had an equal number of participants (<i>n</i> = 117). The data were collected using a demographic information questionnaire, a researcher-made questionnaire based on the model constructs and the SF-12 quality of life questionnaire. The instruments were once administered before the intervention and once again 4 months after the intervention. The educational intervention included 3 sessions a week, each 60 min in length, shared in WhatsApp and Telegram. The data were analyzed in statistical package for the social sciences version 24 using Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test, chi-square test, Wilcoxon's test, and analysis of covariance. The results showed that after the educational intervention, the mean scores of knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, enabling afctors, reinforcing factors and the mean score of overall quality of life increased significantly in the intervention group compared to the control (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The covariance analysis showed when the effect of the pretest score is removed, the mean scores of the model constructs and the quality of life are significantly different in the two groups. Educational interventions based on the PRECEDE model can help identify factors affecting the quality of life on many aspects in patients with thalassemia major. Thus, these interventions help improve patients' quality of life. The present findings can guide health policy makers and experts use modern educational interventions to develop the educational content to promote a healthy lifestyle and self-management in certain diseases such as thalassemia major."

    "title": "A Comparison of Pain Before and After Transfusion in Adult transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) Using BPI-SF.",
    "abstract": "Background <i>Pain</i> is a complication in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). There are several mechanisms underlying pain in people with thalassemia and low hemoglobin at the end of the transfusion cycle was the most etiology. Pain can develop into chronic pain and interfere with the quality of life. The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) can help identify pain in people with TDT. The present study aimed to compare pain before and after transfusion in adult TDT patients. Methods It was an analytical observational study using a cross-sectional design on adult TDT patients with pain who came to the Haemato-Oncology Clinic of Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung. This study was conducted from December 2020 to July 2021. All subjects were assisted in filling out the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF questionnaire hemoglobin levels were examined and before and after transfusion, then paired test analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon Test. Results This study is conducted on 60 adult TDT patients with symptoms of pain. The median value of pain intensity and pain interferes with life obtained from the Indonesian version of the BPI-SF score after transfusion decreased significantly compared to before transfusion (NRS 5 vs. 0 and 2.8 vs. 0; p=0.0001). Conclusion There is a significant difference in pain intensity and pain interfere with life in adults with TDT before and after transfusion. It is necessary to carry out pain assessments for thalassemia patients."

    "title": "McArdle's Disease: A Differential Diagnosis of Metabolic Myopathies.",
    "abstract": "McArdle's disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type V or McArdle syndrome, is a pure muscle myopathy with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. It is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes muscle phosphorylase. Symptoms typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood, presenting as exercise intolerance. This review focuses on the diagnosis of McArdle's disease, initially manifesting as a clinical picture of rhabdomyolysis in an 18-year-old male patient with a history of minor thalassemia who had been followed in pediatric consultation since age three for failure to thrive. After excluding common causes such as alcohol consumption, drug use, traumatic muscle compression, and other conditions, the diagnosis of McArdle's disease was considered. The diagnosis was supported by laboratory tests showing myoglobinuria and elevated creatine kinase levels, as well as the absence of increased serum lactate following ischemic exercise. Genetic testing confirmed the presence of mutations in the PYGM gene, corroborating the diagnosis. Treatment includes administering a diet rich in slow-absorbing carbohydrates, regular low-intensity physical exercise, and, in some cases, supplementation with vitamin B6 and creatine. The prognosis is generally favorable with proper disease management, although vigorous exercise should be avoided to prevent complications such as severe muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis. Although McArdle's disease is a rare condition, it is likely underdiagnosed. Ideally, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in all patients with symptoms of exercise intolerance and/or recurrent myoglobinuria."

The current investigation is a single-center retrospective cohort study. HbA1c concentration was detected by using TOSOH HLC-723G8 glycated hemoglobin analyzer. SNaPshot SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) typing and AccuCopy technology were employed to detect mutations in thalassemia-related pathogenic genes. A total of 126 patients endured high HbF levels or abnormal Hb peak during HbA1c detection, and 66.7% of subjects (n = 84) showed thalassemia mutations. Three heterozygosity mutations, including c.52A>T (p.K18*), c.-78A>G, and c.126_129delCTTT(p.F42Lfs*19) present in HBB gene, were also identified. --<sup>SEA</sup>/αα mutation demonstrated the youngest ages (p < 0.001). 17 M (p < 0.001) and 41/42 M (p < 0.01) mutations with β-thalassemia showed higher HbF levels compared with patients without thalassemia mutations. Except for -α<sup>3.7</sup>, mutations in thalassemia showed lower levels of mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) compared with patients without thalassemia mutations. Patients with thalassemia mutations showed younger age (p < 0.001), lower Hb (p < 0.001), MCV and MCH levels (p < 0.001), higher red blood cell (RBC) count (p < 0.001), and platelet distribution width (PDW) level (p = 0.007) than patients without thalassemia mutations. Three statistical models indicate MCV is the most valuable independent factor for predicting thalassemia and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves analysis of AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.855 (95% CI [0.787-0.923], p < 0.001) with MCV. High HbF level (≥ 1.5%) or abnormal Hb peak present in HbA1c testing indicated high incident rate of thalassemia. MCV is the most valuable independent predicting factor for subjects having thalassemia."

    "title": "Combining clinical and molecular data for personalized treatment in acute myeloid leukemia: A machine learning approach.",
    "abstract": "The standard of care in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients has remained essentially unchanged for nearly 40 years. Due to the complicated mutational patterns within and between individual patients and a lack of targeted agents for most mutational events, implementing individualized treatment for AML has proven difficult. We reanalysed the BeatAML dataset employing Machine Learning algorithms. The BeatAML project entails patients extensively characterized at the molecular and clinical levels and linked to drug sensitivity outputs. Our approach capitalizes on the molecular and clinical data provided by the BeatAML dataset to predict the ex vivo drug sensitivity for the 122 drugs evaluated by the project. We utilized ElasticNet, which produces fully interpretable models, in combination with a two-step training protocol that allowed us to narrow down computations. We automated the genes' filtering step by employing two metrics, and we evaluated all possible data combinations to identify the best training configuration settings per drug. We report a Pearson correlation across all drugs of 0.36 when clinical and RNA sequencing data were combined, with the best-performing models reaching a Pearson correlation of 0.67. When we trained using the datasets in isolation, we noted that RNA Sequencing data (Pearson: 0.36) attained three times the predictive power of whole exome sequencing data (Pearson: 0.11), with clinical data falling somewhere in between (Pearson 0.26). Lastly, we present a paradigm of clinical significance. We used our models' prediction as a drug sensitivity score to rank an individual's expected response to treatment. We identified 78 patients out of 89 (88 %) that the proposed drug was more potent than the administered one based on their ex vivo drug sensitivity data. In conclusion, our reanalysis of the BeatAML dataset using Machine Learning algorithms demonstrates the potential for individualized treatment prediction in Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients, addressing the longstanding challenge of treatment personalization in this disease. By leveraging molecular and clinical data, our approach yields promising correlations between predicted drug sensitivity and actual responses, highlighting a significant step forward in improving therapeutic outcomes for AML patients."

    "abstract": "There is a group of beta (β)-thalassemia trait 'carriers' (with heterozygous mutations) who should be asymptomatic with minor abnormalities in their hematological parameters, but experience more severe disease manifestations than predicted based solely on their β-globin genotype. This review focuses on literature describing trans-acting genetic modifiers outside of the α- and β-globin gene clusters that could cause this phenomenon. These genetic modifiers are categorized into: mutations affecting the quantity of alpha-globin products, non-globin mutations affecting erythropoiesis, membranopathies, enzymopathies and erythrocyte-independent modifiers of complications relating to β-thalassemia. Although some genetic determinants seem to correlate more directly with β-thalassemia trait severity, such as mutations in SUPT5H, PIEZO1 and hereditary elliptocytosis, the difficulties of linking the contribution of other modulating factors are elucidated in this review. Targeted next generation sequencing of hemolytic anemias can be helpful but also raises another quandary in interpreting variants of uncertain significance. The accrual of knowledge, along with the increased availability of genetic testing for genetic modifiers has considerable potential for clinical applications such as genetic counselling, decision-making for clinical interventions and prognostication, and perhaps generating new therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, are genetic disorders that affect hemoglobin structure or production, leading to various health complications, including an increased risk of infections. Vaccinations play a crucial role in managing these conditions by providing essential protection against preventable diseases. Ensuring timely and appropriate immunizations is vital for reducing infection-related morbidity and improving the overall health and quality of life for affected individuals. Our objective was to assess vaccination coverage, as well as knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward vaccination in Greek patients with hemoglobinopathies. A nationwide survey of hemoglobinopathy patients in Greece using a 37-item questionnaire was conducted anonymously via Google Forms. It covered demographics, previous vaccinations, vaccine-preventable infections, beliefs about vaccines, and antibiotic prophylaxis post-splenectomy. The survey was distributed through Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Units and organizations. Participants were predominantly university-educated married women aged 30-50 years with transfusion-depended thalassemia (<i>n</i> = 149, 60.5%) or sickle cell anemia (<i>n</i> = 52, 21.1%). Reported childhood vaccination rates aligned with Greece's national immunization program. However, adult coverage was suboptimal across all age groups for measles (10%), varicella (27%), zoster (2% for over 50 years old individuals), hepatitis A (13.9% of those with chronic liver disease) and hepatitis B (41%), pneumococcal (81.3%), meningococcal (37%), tetanus (20.3%), and influenza (67.1%) vaccines compared to guidelines. Participants relied predominantly on healthcare providers for vaccine information but perceived limited engagement. Those over age 50 demonstrated lower adult vaccination rates and higher misconceptions compared to younger cohorts. Addressing educational and access gaps could help protect this vulnerable population. Our findings highlight the need for coordinated efforts to optimize adult immunization for those with hemoglobinopathies."

    "abstract": "Ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) is the primary cause of anemia and associated pathologies in <i>β</i>-thalassemia. The characterization of IE is imbalance of erythroid proliferation and differentiation, resulting in increased erythroblast proliferation that fails to differentiate and gives rise to enucleate RBCs. MicroRNAs (miRs) are known to play important roles in hematopoiesis. miR-155 is a multifunctional molecule involved in both normal and pathological hematopoiesis, and its upregulation is observed in patients with <i>β</i>-thalassemia/HbE. However, the expression and function of miR-155, especially in <i>β</i>-thalassemia, have not yet been explored. To study miR-155 expression in thalassemia, erythroblast subpopulations, CD45-CD71<sup>+</sup>Ter-119<sup>+</sup> and CD45-CD71<sup>-</sup>Ter-119<sup>+</sup> were collected from <i>β</i> <sup>IVSII-654</sup> thalassemic bone marrow. Additionally, a two-phase culture of mouse bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells was performed. Expression of miR-155 and predicted mRNA target genes, <i>c-myc</i>, <i>bach-1</i> and <i>pu-1</i>, were determined by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) 202 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), respectively. To investigate the effect of miR-155 expression, erythroblasts were transfected with miR-inhibitor and -mimic in order to elevate and eliminate miR-155 expression, respectively. Erythroid cell differentiation was evaluated by Wright-Giemsa staining and flow cytometry. miR-155 was upregulated, both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, during erythropoiesis in <i>β</i>-thalassemic mice. Our study revealed that gain- and loss of function of miR-155 were involved in erythroid proliferation and differentiation, and augmented proliferation and differentiation of thalassemic mouse erythroblasts may be associated with miR-155 upregulation. miR-155 upregulation in <i>β</i>-thalassemic mice significantly increased the percentage of basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts. Conversely, a significant decrease in percentage of basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts was observed in <i>β</i>-thalassemic mice transfected with anti-miR-155 inhibitor. We also examined the mRNA targets (<i>c-myc</i>, <i>bach-1</i> and <i>pu-1</i>) of miR-155, which indicated that <i>c-myc</i> is a valid target gene of miR-155 that regulates erythroid differentiation. miR-155 regulates IE in <i>β</i>-thalassemia via <i>c-myc</i> expression controlling erythroblast proliferation and differentiation."

    "abstract": "To determine the molecular basis, genotype - phenotype relationship, and genetic origin of Hemoglobin (Hb) Hekinan associated with several forms of α-thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies for a better understanding of its diverse clinical phenotypes. Seventeen participants with suspected abnormal Hb were studied. Hb analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Mutational and α-haplotypic and structural analyses were conducted, and the effects of mutations on globin-chain stability were determined. All participants harbored Hb Hekinan II (HBA1:c.84 G>T) co-inherited with another α-globin gene anomaly. Three novel genotypes, (αα<sup>Hekinan</sup>/α<sup>CS</sup>α), (αα<sup>Hekinan</sup>/α<sup>CS</sup>α,β<sup>A</sup>/β<sup>E</sup>), and (αα<sup>Hekinan</sup>/α<sup>CS</sup>α,β<sup>E</sup>/β<sup>E</sup>), were characterized. Despite being co-inherited with both α- and β-Hb variants Hb Hekinan II led to minimal changes in erythrocyte parameters, suggesting a non-pathological nature. HPLC but not CE revealed a distinct small shoulder-like Hb pattern. Thai Hb Hekinan II was strongly associated with haplotype [+ - S + - - -] and the possibility of four different haplotypes, while two Burmese Hb Hekinan II were associated with haplotypes [± - S + - + -] and [± - S + - - -]. The novel genotypes identified provide a fresh perspective on Hb Hekinan II diversity. HPLC has superior identification capabilities for samples of Hb Hekinan II co-inherited with α-thalassemia. Thai and Burmese Hb Hekinan II have diverse origins."

However, screening for Hb Malay is challenging as it is undetectable by routine capillary electrophoresis (CE) or high-performance liquid chromatograpy (HPLC) methods. This study aimed to determine the Hb Malay phenotypes. The study was done on 521 cases with presumed β thalassemia from UKMMC and Hospital Selayang as well as confirmed Hb Malay cases from Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah in over a 5-year period. Hb analysis using CE or HPLC followed by multiplex amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were performed. Significant differences in mean values of haematological parameters among Hb Malay carriers against β thalassemia carriers were determined using one-way ANOVA and ROC analysis. A total of 482/521 cases of β globin mutations were identified. Among these, 54 Hb Malay cases were identified whereby 21 Hb Malay cases were from UKMMC and Hospital Selayang whilst 33 Hb Malay cases were from Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah. Fifty-two were Hb Malay carriers whereas two cases were compound heterozygotes. The mean hemoglobin, mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin, and HbA of Hb Malay carriers were significantly higher than β° thalassemia carriers. The HbA<sub>2</sub> range of Hb Malay carriers was wider (3.5-5.5%) with median value of 3.9%. A new HbA<sub>2</sub> cutoff value ≤4.6% (AUC 0.717, <i>p</i> < 0.001) was proposed. Compound heterozygous Hb Malay/IVS1-5(G > C) showed transfusion-dependent thalassemia phenotype. Hb Malay carriers have different red cell and electrophoretic parameters than classical β° thalassemia carriers with wider HbA<sub>2</sub> range. HbA<sub>2</sub> of ≤4.6% should prompt a molecular confirmation for Hb Malay carrier status."

While qualitative (i.e. sickle cell disease) and quantitative (thalassemia) hemoglobinopathies are usually diagnosed clinically and confirmed through simple laboratory assessments, hemoglobin variants with altered oxygen affinity often go undetected due to their typically silent clinical presentation. Hemoglobin (Hb) J-Auckland, a low oxygen affinity hemoglobin variant first described in 1987 in Auckland, New Zealand, is one such silent disorder. We report for the first time a clinically evident case of previously undiagnosed Hb J-Auckland in an 8-year-old girl who presented with unexplained hypoxemia at high altitude. Her oxygen level was corrected with supplemental oxygen and when assessed at low altitude. A brief discussion of the diagnostic approach and clinical implications is provided. Standard hemoglobin analysis is essential for the evaluation of suspected altered affinity hemoglobinopathy, and genetic testing is often required for definitive diagnosis. Early recognition and diagnosis of these variants can prevent mismanagement and improve patient outcomes."

This study aimed to investigate the frequencies of KEL blood group antigens (K, k, Kpa, and Kpb) and determine KEL phenotypes (K/k and Kpa/Kpb) among Saudi blood donors living in Jazan Province. A total of 138 anonymous healthy Saudi blood donors from Prince Mohammed bin Nasser Hospital in Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia, were enrolled in this study. Anticoagulated blood was analyzed using the gel card technique to assess K, k, Kpa, and Kpb antigens. The prevalence of KEL antigens was as follows: K (n = 9, 6.52%), k (n = 137, 99.28%), Kpa (n = 1, 0.72%), and Kpb (n = 138, 100%).

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic medical condition characterized by red blood cell sickling, vaso-occlusion, hemolytic anemia, and subsequently, end-organ damage and reduced survival. Because of this significant pathophysiology and early mortality, we hypothesized that patients with SCD are experiencing accelerated biological aging compared with individuals without SCD. We utilized the DunedinPACE measure to compare the epigenetic pace of aging in 131 Black Americans with SCD to 1391 Black American veterans without SCD. SCD patients displayed a significantly accelerated pace of aging (DunedinPACE mean difference of 0.057 points) compared with the veterans without SCD, whereby SCD patients were aging ≈0.7 months more per year than those without SCD (p = 4.49 × 10-8). This was true, even though the SCD patients were significantly younger according to chronological age than the individuals without SCD, making the epigenetic aging discrepancy even more apparent. This association became stronger when we removed individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder from the non-SCD group (p = 2.18 × 10-9), and stronger still when we restricted the SCD patients to those with hemoglobin SS and Sβ0 thalassemia genotypes (p = 1.61 × 10-10). These data support our hypothesis that individuals with SCD experience accelerated biological aging as measured by global epigenetic variation. The assessment of epigenetic measures of biological aging may prove useful to identify which SCD patients would most benefit from clinical interventions to reduce mortality."

The mechanotransductor PIEZO1 appears to be a natural candidate for sensing these mechanical forces and regulating megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Gain-of-function mutations of PIEZO1 cause hereditary xerocytosis, a haemolytic anaemia associated with thrombotic events. If some functions of PIEZO1 have been reported in platelets, few data exist on PIEZO1 role in megakaryopoiesis. To address this subject, we used an in vitro model of Mk differentiation from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and studied step-by-step the effects of PIEZO1 activation by the chemical activator YODA1 during Mk differentiation and maturation. We report that PIEZO1 activation by 4 μM YODA1 at early stages of culture induced cytosolic calcium ion influx and reduced cell maturation. Indeed, CD41<sup>+</sup>CD42<sup>+</sup> numbers were reduced by around 1.5-fold, with no effects on proliferation. At later stages of Mk differentiation, PIEZO1 activation promoted endomitosis and proplatelet formation that was reversed by PIEZO1 gene invalidation with a shRNA-PIEZO1. Same observations on endomitosis were reproduced in HEL cells induced into Mks by PMA and treated with YODA1. We provide for the first time results suggesting a dual role of PIEZO1 mechanotransductor during megakaryopoiesis."

    "abstract": "Iron overload results in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the oxidative modification of circulating lipoproteins, which contributes to cardiovascular complications in patients with β-thalassemia. Investigating LPO may provide opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies; however, the chemical pathways underlying iron overload-induced LPO in β-thalassemia lipoproteins remain unclear. In this study, we identified various species of lipid radicals (L<sup>•</sup>), the key mediators of LPO, and oxidized cholesteryl esters (oxCE) derived from the in vitro oxidation of major core lipids, cholesteryl linoleate (CE18:2) and cholesteryl arachidonate (CE20:4); the levels of these radical products in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) were measured and compared between β-thalassemia patients and healthy subjects by using a specific fluorescent probe for L<sup>•</sup> with a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method. Our results demonstrated that iron overload substantially decreased the levels of CE18:2 and CE20:4 substrates and α-tocopherol, resulting in higher levels of full-length and short-chain truncated L<sup>•</sup> and oxCE products. In particular, CE epoxyallyl radicals (<sup>•</sup>CE-O) were observed in the lipoproteins of β-thalassemia, revealing the pathological roles of iron overload in the progression of LPO. In addition, we found that intermission for two weeks of iron chelators can increase the production of these oxidized products; therefore, suggesting the beneficial effects of iron chelators in preventing LPO progression. In conclusion, our findings partly revealed the primary chemical pathway by which the LPO of circulating lipoproteins is influenced by iron overload and affected by iron chelation therapy. Moreover, we found that <sup>•</sup>CE + O shows potential as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring LPO in individuals with β-thalassemia."

The indications for OC were as follows: primary ovarian insufficiency (n = 7), ovarian surgery for ovarian tumors (n = 5) or ovarian torsion (n = 1), mosaic Turner syndrome (n = 2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1) anaplastic B-cell lymphoma (n = 1), Ewing's sarcoma (n = 1), Noonan syndrome (n = 1), and Thalassemia (n = 1). The mean number of oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes frozen, and maturation rate were 5.11 ± 5.0, 3.92 ± 4.48, and 75.1 ± 25.6%, respectively. Stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between AFC and number of total oocytes retrieved and number of MII oocytes. In the case diagnosed with Noonan syndrome, all 7 retrieved oocytes were MI and all frozen at MI phase. No patient had any complication related to COS or OR. Even though number of the enrolled subjects is limited and mean AMH is lower in our cohort, we demonstrated that performing COS and OR is safe in pre-/peripubertal patients. If required, transabdominal route can be performed in this age group for OR. AFC appears as a prognostic factor for stimulation outcome in this age group. Pediatric patients or young adolescents at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency should not be discouraged from utilizing OC."

    "abstract": "β-Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder requiring lifetime management of anemia and its complications. This study aimed to determine the indirect costs and humanistic burden of β-thalassemia. A systematic literature review was conducted. Searches were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and EconLit (November 1, 2010, to November 25, 2020). Studies reporting indirect costs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with β-thalassemia were eligible. Seventy-five publications were included. Mean annual days lost due to transfusion-related absenteeism ranged from 15.6 to 35 days. Patients spent a mean of 592 min (standard deviation (SD): 349) daily on disease management on transfusion days and 91 min (SD: 221) daily on non-transfusion days. Patients with non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (NTDT) showed worse HRQoL versus those with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) on the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (75.8 vs 66.5; <i>p</i> = 0.021). Caregivers of patients with TDT had more severe stress compared with patients (20.17 vs 18.95; <i>p</i> = 0.006), as measured by the standardized Cohen Perceived Stress Questionnaire. TDT is associated with substantial indirect costs and caregiver burden, and NTDT is associated with worse HRQoL. There is an unmet need for novel treatments in both TDT and NTDT that minimize patient and caregiver burden."

    "title": "Detection of Hemoglobin Constant Spring: A Comparison of Capillary Electrophoresis Versus High-Performance Liquid Chromatography.",
    "abstract": "In Malaysia, Hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) is the most common non-deletional α-thalassemia, caused by a mutation at the termination codon of the α2-globin gene (TAA>CAA). Detection typically involves identifying an abnormal peak at zone 2 on capillary electrophoresis (CE) or a small peak at the C-window on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), indicative of Hb CS. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between HPLC and CE in detecting Hb CS, evaluating their respective diagnostic accuracies and limitations. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah involving secondary school students (Form 4) from Terengganu who participated in a thalassemia screening program conducted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) from January 2019 to December 2022. Blood samples from subjects showing a positive peak in zone 2 of CE and a small peak at the C-window of HPLC were selected. Molecular studies of these samples were performed to confirm the presence of Hb CS. For the statistical analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient was employed to assess the relationship between CE and HPLC results. Hb CS was confirmed in all samples by molecular studies, revealing 92.3% heterozygous, 7.2% compound heterozygous, and 0.5% homozygous cases. CE detected 92.3% of heterozygous Hb CS cases, while HPLC detected only 48.2%. For compound heterozygous Hb CS, CE detected 100%, whereas HPLC detected 89.3%. Both homozygous cases were detected by CE and HPLC. The Pearson correlation coefficient test showed a significant linear relationship (p<0.001) between CE's zone 2 peak values and HPLC's C-window peaks (n=389). Conclusion: These findings highlight the efficacy of CE as a reliable method for Hb CS detection, suggesting its potential superiority over traditional HPLC in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Sepsis is the leading cause of death worldwide, and a number of biomarkers have been developed for early mortality risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a routinely available hematological data and has been found to be associated with mortality in a number of diseases; therefore, we aim to address the association between RDW and mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. We analyzed data of critically ill adult patients with sepsis on the TriNetX platform, excluding those with hematologic malignancies, thalassemia, and iron deficiency anemia. Propensity score-matching (PSM) (1:1) was used to mitigate confounding effects, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence (CI) was calculated to determine the association between RDW and 30-day mortality. We further conducted sensitivity analyses through using distinct cut-points of RDW and severities of sepsis. A total of 256,387 critically ill septic patients were included in the analysis, and 40.0% of them had RDW equal to or higher than 16%. After PSM, we found that high RDW was associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate (HR: 1.887, 95% CI 1.847-1.928). The associations were consistent using distinct cut-points of RDW, with the strength of association using cut-points of 12%, 14%, 16%, 18% and 20% were 2.098, 2.204, 1.887, 1.809 and 1.932, respectively. Furthermore, we found consistent associations among critically ill septic patients with distinct severities, with the association among those with shock, receiving mechanical ventilation, bacteremia and requirement of hemodialysis being 1.731, 1.735, 2.380 and 1.979, respectively. We found that RDW was associated with 30-day mortality in critically ill septic patients, underscoring the potential as a prognostic marker in sepsis. More studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Before the advent of effective iron chelation, death from iron-induced cardiomyopathy and endocrine failure occurred in the second decade in patients with thalassemia major, and this experience has driven expectation of poor outcomes and caused anxiety in all disorders associated with iron loading to this day. To be clear, severe iron overload still causes significant morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, but current understanding of iron metabolism, noninvasive monitoring of organ-specific iron loading in humans, and effective iron chelators have dramatically reduced morbidity of iron overload. Furthermore, clinical experience in hemoglobinopathies supports iron biology learned from animal studies and identifies common concepts in the biology of iron toxicity that inform the management of iron toxicity in several human disorders. The resultant significant increase in survival uncovers new complications due to much longer exposure to anemia and to iron, which must be considered in long-term therapeutic strategies. This review will discuss the management of iron toxicity in patients with hemoglobinopathies and transfusion-dependent anemias and how iron biology informs the clinical approach to treatment."

Musculoskeletal manifestations are frequent, but rhabdomyolysis is a rare complication of COVID-19. It can be easily missed when there is a lack of high suspicion, especially in mild cases. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is a simple and affordable test that can screen COVID-19 patients having rhabdomyolysis, especially when they have predominant musculoskeletal symptoms. Early recognition and management of rhabdomyolysis can prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) and its related complications. Here, we present a young male with β-thalassemia minor who had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). He presented with symptoms suggestive of upper respiratory tract infection and myalgia. He later complained of cola-colored urine. Urine evaluation did not reveal myoglobinuria or hematuria, and there was no evidence of significant hemolysis. Extremely high serum CPK levels and the clinical scenario were suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. He was admitted and adequately hydrated with other symptomatic management. His renal functions and other parameters were monitored. He recovered well with an uneventful course in the hospital."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is one of the most common genetic disorders. Patients with beta-thalassemia major confront serious clinical and psychosocial challenges in their all lives, which require coping strategies. It appears that psychological interventions are necessary to improve their coping skills. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of applying emotional intelligence components on coping strategies in adolescents with beta- thalassemia major. This randomized clinical trial study involved 60 teenagers with beta- thalassemia major who were divided equally into intervention and control groups. The experimental group participated in 9 sessions of an emotional intelligence program consisting of 90 min, held both virtually and in person, two sessions per week. We investigated problem-focused and emotion-focused (including positive emotion-focused and negative emotion-focused) coping strategies of both groups of adolescents using the Billings and Moos questionnaire before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and one month after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Then, according to the research objectives, independent t-tests, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni test were used. In experimental group, the mean score of problem-focused (problem-solving, cognitive evaluation) and positive emotion-focused (social support) coping increased from (14.2 ± 2.6) and (5.0 ± 0.5) before the intervention to (29.6 ± 3.1) and (10.9 ± 1.3) one month after the intervention, respectively (P < 0.001). However, the mean score of emotional inhibition and somatic inhibition (negative emotion-focused) decreased from (13.8 ± 1.7) and (6.7 ± 1.5) before the intervention to (8.6 ± 2.0) and (3.8 ± 1.8) one month after the intervention, respectively (P < 0.001). While the mean score of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies before and one month after the intervention remained stable in the control group. Adolescents with beta-thalassemia suffer from psychosocial disorders and they also cope maladaptive with their illness. Applying emotional intelligence has improved their coping strategies. Caregivers should be encouraged to assess coping skills in teenagers with beta-thalassemia major and use methods such as emotional intelligence to improve them. Therefore, it can help these adolescents to deal effectively with stress and complications of the disease. IRCT20210521051356N1 (17/06/2021)."

Hematological and molecular characterization were carried out in a Thai family with a risk of having fetus with Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. Both parents were found to be the thalassemia intermedia patients associated with unusual forms of Hb H disease. DNA analysis of common α-thalassemia mutations in Thailand identified α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia (-α<sup>3.7 kb del</sup>) and unknown α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia in the father and α<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia (--<sup>SEA</sup>) with unknown α<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia in the mother.

    "abstract": "Thalassemia is widely prevalent in Asian countries and the Middle East region of the world. While the prevalence of α thal is around 5-20% in the population, the incidence of β thal is around 3-4%. The available data on thalassemia in Indians is based on chromatographic or electrophoretic techniques. The present study demonstrates the utility of mass spectrometry in detecting thalassemia in a small, healthy population from Tiptur, Karnataka. The study included a population of 315 individuals, spanning both children and adults, with ages ranging from 4 to 76 years. EDTA whole blood was collected after obtaining their written consent. The intensities of various globin chains were measured using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The ratio of the peak areas of globin chains (α/β, δ/β (%)) served as biomarkers to detect thalassemia. Thirty random samples of α thalassemia were analyzed using GapPCR. The prevalence of a thal is 21.65% (68/314) based on α/β (< =0.8) and the prevalence of β thal is 3.8% (12/314) based on δ/β (%) (> =11.0). GapPCR detected three heteromutants of α deletion, one mutation in the HBA1 gene, and one a triplication (16.7%, 5/30). One sample was excluded from the analysis due to the presence of a variant. The utility of mass spectrometry for screening thalassemia in a population is demonstrated. The higher occurrence of α-thalassemia in the studied population underscores the importance of screening for thalassemia in regions with reportedly high prevalence rates."

While severe alpha thalassemia results in intrauterine death, β-thalassemia manifests during childhood due to the \"second conversion of hemoglobin\", garnering increased attention in recent decades. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted of thalassemia articles published in the Web of Science Core Collection database between 2013 and 2023 to establish a comprehensive overview and to identify emerging trends. A total of 5655 studies published between 2013 and 2023 were systematically retrieved, and annual publications demonstrated a steady increase, maintaining a high level over the past decade. The United States contributed the highest number of publications, followed by China. Notably, the journal <i>Blood</i> emerged as the leading authority in β-thalassemia research. Analysis of research hotspots revealed that the pathogenesis of β-thalassemia is primarily linked to iron overload, anemia, gene mutations, and ineffective erythropoiesis. Furthermore, recent studies focusing on gene editing therapies present promising avenues for future investigation. These findings grasp the research status of β-thalassemia and shed new light on future research frontiers."

In this report, we present a 7-year-old Moroccan boy with severe intellectual disability, autistic features, typical facial dysmorphia, bilateral cryptorchidism, and scoliosis. Whole exome sequencing identified a missense variant of uncertain significance in the <i>ATRX</i> gene (NM_000489.3: c.745G>A). In silico tools strongly predict the pathogenicity of this variant. Moreover, this variant occurs in a highly conserved domain, potentially affecting the function of the encoded protein, and the glycine at position 249 is well conserved across different species. Further studies are needed to confirm the pathogenicity of this novel variant to establish adequate genetic counseling."

A 61-year-old Sicilian male was referred for a microcytic anemia associated with skin lesions, recurrent fever, involuntary weight loss, recurrent superficial venous thrombosis, migratory polyarthritis and a lung nodule. A hemoglobin electrophoresis uncovered a minor beta-thalassemia contributing to the anemia in addition to the chronic inflammation and vitamin B9/B12 deficiencies. A bone marrow aspiration demonstrated the presence of vacuoles in erythroid and myeloid precursors, as well as dysplasia in all three lineages. This led us to consider VEXAS syndrome which was confirmed by the presence of UBA1 mutation type p.M41T. Low-dose steroids and sarilumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) therapy led to a transient partial remission. The pivotal insight from this observation centers around the microcytic characteristic of the anemia, with the confounding factor being minor thalassemia, whereas the type of anemia typically associated with VEXAS is macrocytic. This finding may be of particular relevance to patients from regions with endemic thalassemia. Consequently, the presence of microcytic anemia should not hinder clinicians from considering VEXAS syndrome in the appropriate clinical context."

The Nyvad criteria and DMFT index were used to assess caries arrest and prevention among both groups at 3- and 6-months interval. Caries arrest rate at 3 months was significantly higher in Group I (83.10%) when compared to Group II (76.16%) (p<0.05). While at 6 months, both the groups were comparable with arrest rate (76.16%) (p>0.05). The caries increment was comparable among both groups at 3 months, while at 6 months, caries increment was almost half in SN with NaF group compared to SDF group (p>0.05). Kaplan-Meir survival estimated the median survival time for caries increment was 17 and 39 weeks for Group I and 15 and 36 weeks for Group II at 3 and 6 months, respectively.

Participants performed 3 sessions per week for 45 minutes in each session for 8 weeks of aerobic interval exercise with an intensity of 50% to 65% of the heart rate reserve. Blood samples were taken before, immediately after the exercise session, and 48 hours after the last training session, and liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ferritin, and hepcidin were evaluated. The results showed a decrease in aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, ALP, ferritin, and hepcidin levels due to 8 weeks of aerobic interval training (P = .14, P = .97, P = .03, P < .001, P < .001; respectively). Intergroup changes in all variables except ALT and hepcidin were significant (P < .05). Besides, acute aerobic exercise increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, ferritin, and hepcidin (P = .04, P = .52, P < .001, P < .001; respectively), whereas ALP levels decreased (P < .001). In addition, changes in ALP and hepcidin levels were significant between the 2 groups (P = .05, P < .001; respectively). Based on the study's results, it can be concluded that 8 weeks of aerobic interval training can decrease ferritin and hepcidin levels, but acute aerobic exercise increases them."

Initial studies of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies involved the use of lentiviral vectors to add functional copies of the gene encoding β-globin in defective CD34 cells; more recently, gene editing techniques have been used involving either CRISPR-Cas9, transcription activation-like effector protein nuclease, zinc finger nuclease, and base editing to either induce fetal hemoglobin production at therapeutic levels or to genetically repair the underlying molecular defect causing the disease. Here, we review recent gene editing studies that have started the development of a new era in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies and, in general, monoallelic hereditary diseases."

    "title": "SNPscan Combined With CNVplex as a High-Performance Diagnostic Method for Thalassemia.",
    "abstract": "Thalassemia is a Mendelian-inherited blood disorder with severe consequences, including disability and mortality, making it a significant public health concern. Therefore, there is an urgent need for precise diagnostic technologies. We introduce two innovative diagnostic techniques for thalassemia, SNPscan and CNVplex, designed to enhance molecular diagnostics of thalassemia. The SNPscan and CNVplex assays utilize variations in PCR product length and fluorescence to identify multiple mutations. In the SNPscan method, we designed three probes per locus: two 5' and one 3', and incorporated allele identification link sequences into one of the 5' probes to distinguish the alleles. The detection system was designed for 67 previously reported loci in the Chinese population for a specific genetic condition. CNVplex identifies deletion types by analyzing the specific positions of probes within the globin gene. This innovative approach enables the detection of six distinct deletional mutations, enhancing the precision of thalassemia diagnostics. We evaluated and refined the methodologies in a training cohort of 100 individuals with confirmed HBA and HBB genotypes. The validation cohort, consisting of 1647 thalassemia patients and 100 healthy controls, underwent a double-blind study. Traditional diagnostic techniques served as the control methods. In the training set of 100 samples, 10 mutations (Hb QS, Hb CS, Hb Westmead, CD17, CD26, CD41-42, IVS-II-654, --<sup>SEA</sup>, -α<sup>3.7</sup> and -α<sup>4.2</sup>) were identified, consistent with those identified by traditional methods. The validation study showed that SNPscan/CNVplex offered superior molecular diagnostic capabilities for thalassemia, with 100% accuracy compared to 99.43% for traditional methods. Notably, the assay identified three previously undetected mutations in 10 cases, including two deletion mutations (Chinese <sup>G</sup>γ(<sup>A</sup>γδβ)<sup>0</sup> del and SEA-HPFH), and one non-deletion mutation (Hb Q-Thailand). The SNPscan/CNVplex assay is a cost-effective and user-friendly tool for diagnosing thalassemia, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability, and showing great potential as a primary diagnostic method in clinical practice."

    "title": "Technically feasible solutions to challenges in preimplantation genetic testing for thalassemia: experiences of multiple centers between 2019 and 2022.",
    "abstract": "In clinical practice, the success of preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic diseases (PGT-M) for thalassemia was hindered by the absence of probands, incomplete family members, or failure in detecting embryonic gene mutation sites. This study aimed to address these issues. This retrospective study included 342 couples undergoing PGT-M for α- or β-thalassemia at three reproductive medicine centers from 2019 to 2022. Various methods were used to construct parental haplotypes. A total of 1778 embryos were analyzed and selected for transfer based on chromosomal ploidy and PGT-M results. Follow-up involved amniocentesis results and clinical outcomes. Haplotypes were established using DNA samples from probands or parents, as well as sibling blood samples, single sperm, and affected embryos, achieving an overall success rate was 99.4% (340/342). For α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia, the concordance between embryo single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype analysis results and mutation loci detection results was 93.8% (1011/1078) and 98.2% (538/548), respectively. Multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC) showed a higher whole genome amplification success rate than multiple displacement amplification (MDA) (98.8% (1031/1044) vs. 96.2% (703/731), p < 0.001). Amniocentesis confirmed PGT-M outcomes in 100% of cases followed up (99/99). This study summarizes feasible solutions to various challenging scenarios encountered in PGT-M for thalassemia, providing valuable insights to enhance success rate of PGT-M in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Thalassemias are genetic disorders of globin chain synthesis. In Iraq, β-thalassemia is more prevalent than α-thalassemia. This study identifies two unpredicted globin gene mutations, a rare α-globin gene mutation (Hb SKMC) and a novel γδβ-thalassemia deletion. Over 2 years, the Genetics unit at PAR hospital in Erbil, northern Iraq processed 137 β-thalassemia and 97 α-thalassemia genetic testing requests. Three symptomatic thalassemia cases with unreported genotypes were identified. Proband-1α and proband-2α had Hb H disease, while proband-1β had severe transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT). Molecular studies included multiplex PCR, reverse hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and globin gene sequencing. The α-thalassemia probands exhibited moderate microcytic hypochromic anemia with irregular transfusions and splenomegaly. Hb H disease was confirmed by positive Hb H tests and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Molecular analysis revealed heterozygous -<sup>MED</sup> deletion in proband-1α and α2<sup>Poly-A2</sup> mutation in proband-2α. Sequencing identified the Hb SKMC (<i>HBA1</i>:c.283_300+3dup) mutation in both probands. The β-thalassemia proband showed anemia and regular transfusions. Molecular studies detected the IVS1.110 G>A mutation and a novel γδβ-thalassemia deletion in compound heterozygous form. The maternal sample showed the IVS1.110 G>A mutation, and MLPA confirmed the γδβ-thalassemia deletion in the paternal sample. These findings highlight the genetic diversity of thalassemias in the region and emphasize the importance of advanced molecular diagnostics in detecting rare mutations."

    "title": "Bacterial siderophores: diversity, uptake pathways and applications.",
    "abstract": "Iron is an essential nutrient for the growth, survival and virulence of almost all bacteria. To access iron, many bacteria produce siderophores, molecules with a high affinity for iron. Research has highlighted substantial diversity in the chemical structure of siderophores produced by bacteria, as well as remarkable variety in the molecular mechanisms involved in strategies for acquiring iron through these molecules. The metal-chelating properties of siderophores, characterized by their high affinity for iron and ability to chelate numerous other metals (albeit with lower affinity compared with iron), have also generated interest in diverse fields. Siderophores find applications in the environment, such as in bioremediation and agriculture, in which emerging and innovative strategies are being developed to address pollution and enhance nutrient availability for plants. Moreover, in medicine, siderophores could be used as a tool for novel antimicrobial therapies and medical imaging, as well as in haemochromatosis, thalassemia or cancer treatments. This Review offers insights into the diversity of siderophores, highlighting their potential applications in environmental and medical contexts."

    "title": "Application of validated UV-Vis spectrophotometry-colorimetric methods for specific quantification of deferiprone in the development of iron-responsive nanoparticle loaded into dissolving microneedle.",
    "abstract": "Deferiprone (DFP) is one of the iron-chelating agents used in iron overload therapy for patients with ß-thalassemia major (ß-TM). However, the use of DFP is limited as it experiences a first-pass effect and can potentially cause iron deficiency due to uncontrolled release. Therefore, iron-responsive (NP-IR) DFP nanoparticle innovation was developed to control DFP release. A dissolving microneedle system (NP-IR-DMNs) was used to maximize DFP release. However, in support of this development, validation of analytical methods using spectrophotometry and colorimetrics was carried out. UV-Vis spectrophotometry is an approach that is easy to use, practical, and more cost-effective than others. The DFP levels were determined in normal and iron-overloaded medium solutions with 1%, 2%, and 4% concentrations. In addition, DFP levels were also measured in rat plasma using the colorimetric method with the addition of FeCl<sub>3</sub> reagent to increase sensitivity for the detection of the analyte. The procedures used as guidelines in the validation procedure are The International Council for Harmonization (ICH). As a result, all linear correlation values of medium and plasma ≥ 0.999 were obtained. The LOQ levels obtained were 0.55 µg/mL, 0.44 µg/mL, 0.42 µg/mL, 0.52 µg/mL, and 1.01 µg/mL in plasma, 1% FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 2% FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 4% FeSO<sub>4</sub>, and normal media, respectively. The accuracy and precision were confirmed valid, as all values were within the requirements and did not change during dilution. Then, this approach was successfully applied to determine the levels of DFP in NP-IR integrated into DMNs."

    "title": "Ovarian Insufficiency in Adolescent Females with Transfusion-Dependent β-Thalassemia: Pituitary versus Ovarian Iron Overload.",
    "abstract": "Females with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) display menstrual irregularities and subfertility at certain points in their lives, even if well-chelated, representing a significant physical and psychological burden. Little is known about the effects of pituitary and ovarian iron contents on ovarian reserve and function. Hence, this study aimed to assess ovarian reserve and pituitary-gonadal axis function in adolescent females with TDT and correlate them with pituitary and ovarian volume, pituitary iron load, and serum ferritin. Fifty adolescent females with TDT were compared to 50 age-matched healthy females. Age of diagnosis of TDT, transfusion index, type of chelation therapy, age at menarche, and Tanner breast stage were assessed. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and ferritin were measured. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pituitary iron content R2* and T2* were measured, and 3-D transabdominal ovarian ultrasound performed. The mean age of the studied females with TDT was 14.54 ± 2.24 years. Ovarian insufficiency was found in 20 of them (40%). Compared to controls, adolescent females with TDT had significantly delayed age of menarche, AMH, FSH, LH, antral follicle count (AFC), and ovarian volume. Upon comparing those with ovarian insufficiency and those without, adolescents with TDT having ovarian insufficiency had significantly higher serum ferritin and pituitary MRI-R2* than those without insufficiency. Multivariate-logistic regression showed that pituitary MRI-R2* was the most significant independent variable associated with ovarian insufficiency among adolescent females with TDT. Adolescent females with TDT have decreased ovarian reserve, AFC, and gonadotropins that are correlated with serum ferritin, pituitary iron load, and ovarian volume. Hence, regular ovarian reserve assessment should be implemented as a part of endocrinological follow-up of females with TDT advising procedures to preserve fertility to those who are likely to have ovarian insufficiency."

    "title": "In vivo silencing of intestinal DMT1 mitigates iron loading in β-thalassemia intermedia (Hbbth3/+) mice.",
    "abstract": "β-thalassemia is an iron-loading anemia caused by homozygous mutation of the hemoglobin subunit β (HBB) gene. In β-thalassemia intermedia (βTI), a non-transfusion-dependent form of the disease, iron overload is caused by excessive absorption of dietary iron due to inappropriately low production of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Low hepcidin stabilizes the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) on the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. High FPN activity may deplete intracellular iron and enhance expression of the predominant iron importer divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1). In mice, DMT1 mediates normal iron absorption under physiological conditions and excessive iron absorption in pathological iron overload (eg, hereditary hemochromatosis). Here, we hypothesized that DMT1 drives elevated iron absorption in βTI. Accordingly, we crossed Hbbth3/+ mice, a preclinical model of βTI, with intestine-specific DMT1-knockout mice. Ablation of intestinal DMT1 in Hbbth3/+ mice caused a pathophysiological shift from iron overload to an iron-deficiency phenotype with exacerbated anemia. DMT1 is thus required for iron absorption and iron loading in Hbbth3/+ mice. Based upon these outcomes, we further logically postulated that in vivo knockdown of intestinal DMT1 would mitigate iron loading in Hbbth3/+ mice. Ginger-derived, lipid nanoparticles carrying DMT1-specific (or control) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were administered by oral, intragastric gavage to 4-week-old Hbbth3/+ mice daily for 16 days. siRNA treatment reduced DMT1 expression by >80% and blunted iron loading, as indicated by significant reductions in liver iron and serum ferritin (which reflect body iron stores). These notable experimental outcomes establish intestinal DMT1 as a plausible therapeutic target to mitigate iron overload in βTI."

It is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, splenomegaly, and systemic iron overload. Exploration new potential biomarkers and drug candidates is important to facilitate the prevention and treatment of β-TH. We applied quasi-targeted metabolomics between wild type (Wt) and heterozygous β-TH mice (Th3/+), a model of non-transfusion-dependent β-TH intermedia, in plasma and peripheral blood (PB) cells. Futher data was deeply mined by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes (KEGG) and machine algorithms methods. Using KEGG enrichment analysis, we found that taurine and hypotaurine metabolism disorders in plasma and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism disorders in PB cells. After systematically anatomize the metabolites by machine algorithms, we confirmed that alpha-muricholic acid<sup>UP</sup> and N-acetyl-DL-phenylalanine<sup>UP</sup> in plasma and Dl-3-hydroxynorvaline<sup>UP</sup>, O-acetyl-L-serine<sup>UP</sup>, H-abu-OH<sup>UP</sup>, S-(Methyl) glutathione<sup>UP</sup>, sepiapterin<sup>DOWN</sup>, and imidazoleacetic acid<sup>DOWN</sup> in PB cells play key roles in predicting the occurrence of β-TH. Furthermore, Sepiapterin, Imidazoleacetic acid, Methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside and alpha-ketoglutaric acid have a good binding capacity to hemoglobin E through molecular docking and are considered to be potential drug candidates for β-TH. Those results may help in identify useful molecular targets in the diagnosis and treatment of β-TH and lays a strong foundation for further research."

    "abstract": "Thalassemia poses a major public health concern in Bangladesh with a high prevalence of carriers. However, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding its epidemiology, clinical aspects, and treatment outcomes. Despite its high prevalence, there is a notable lack of awareness regarding thalassemia in the Bangladeshi population. The absence of precisely validated data impedes a comprehensive understanding of this disease.Premarital thalassemia screening is reportedly a successful strategy for countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran and has also been proposed for Bangladesh. Mandatory screening coupled with genetic counseling is promising for reducing the prevalence of thalassemia by identifying carriers and providing relevant health education. However, sociocultural barriers, challenges, financial constraints, and health risks associated with prenatal diagnosis and abortion could hinder the success of such programs.Positive outcomes from other countries underscore the effectiveness of such programs in reducing thalassemia incidence. The early identification of carriers and genetic counseling can significantly reduce the burden of thalassemia. Additionally, the strain on the healthcare system would be eased, and the quality of life of thalassemia patients would be improved.In conclusion, based on evidence mandatory premarital screening with genetic counseling could be an effective measure to reduce the prevalence of thalassemia in Bangladesh. Leveraging positive attitudes, adopting successful international models, and addressing existing challenges are crucial for the successful implementation of programs that contribute to the overall health and well-being of the country's population."

    "abstract": "β-thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder with a global prevalence, presenting diagnostic and management challenges, particularly in regions with high consanguinity rates. Diagnostic methods include clinical assessments, genetic testing, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Treatment typically involves transfusions and chelation therapy, with gene therapy showing promise. This case series emphasizes the need for tailored care strategies and global health initiatives to improve outcomes for β-thalassemia patients worldwide. This case series involves five patients from rural Nepal presenting various β-thalassemia manifestations. The cases highlight the challenges in diagnosis and management in resource-limited settings. Data were collected through clinical assessments, laboratory investigations, and follow-ups. Each patient's medical history, presentation, and treatment regimen were documented. The cases underscore the importance of regular follow-ups, community engagement, and personalized treatment strategies tailored to genetic profiles. Key findings include the necessity for consistent transfusion schedules, iron overload monitoring, and managing complications associated with β-thalassemia. Enhanced education and healthcare collaboration were noted as critical for optimizing care and outcomes in resource-limited settings. Managing β-thalassemia in resource-limited settings demands timely intervention, regular monitoring, and community involvement. Enhanced healthcare collaboration, access to advanced diagnostic tools, and tailored treatment strategies are paramount in addressing the unique challenges of β-thalassemia. These measures are essential for ensuring an improved quality of life for affected individuals in such regions."

    "abstract": "The study aims to apply the Mentzer index to the population of all eligible pediatric patients presenting to primary healthcare centers (PHCs) in Dubai for the first year of life screening. Additionally, the study will estimate the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and β-thalassemia in children presenting to the PHCs and evaluate the importance of PHCs in screening children for IDA and β-thalassemia by comparing the results of this study to previous results. The SALAMA system (electronic medical record system used in PHCs in Dubai) was used for collecting the data. Eligible patients' data, such as hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red blood cell (RBC) counts were collected and recorded. The Mentzer index was applied to patients and the index results were compared to the gold standard results extracted from the SALAMA system. The gold standard diagnosis for IDA used was the serum ferritin test and the gold standard diagnosis for β-thalassemia used in the study was hemoglobin electrophoresis. Out of the 75 eligible patients with low hemoglobin, 11 (14.6%) had low ferritin indicating IDA. Moreover, eight (10.6%) patients had abnormal hemoglobin electrophoresis indicating β-thalassemia. The Mentzer index was applied to the patients; 13 (17.3%) of them had a value less than 13 (β-thalassemia) and 6 (8%) had a value more than 13 (IDA). The sensitivity of the Menzter index in screening IDA and β-thalassemia is 99% and the specificity is 54.5%. Our study found that the Mentzer's index is a reliable screening tool due to its high sensitivity; however, we suggest replicating the study with a larger sample size to get more clinically significant results."

    "abstract": "Although the survival of patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TD-TM) is reportedly inferior after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the heterogeneity of transplantation approaches in studies suggests the need to assess the effect of conditioning regimen on matched and haploidentical transplantation outcomes. A novel post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based approach for patients with TD-TM undergoing haploidentical HSCT was reported in our prior study. Here we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients with TD-TM after HSCT from matched donors and haploidentical donors (HIDs). In this retrospective multicenter study, among 238 patients with TD-TM who underwent HSCT, 160 underwent peripheral blood HSCT, using uniform GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy, methotrexate, and cyclosporine, at member centers of the Bone Marrow Failure Working Group of Hunan Province between 2019 and 2023. The median age of the cohort at transplantation was 6 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 7 years). The 160 donors included 99 (61.9%) haploidentical family members, 13 matched sibling donors, and 48 matched or mismatched unrelated donors. The engraftment rate was 98.8% (95% CI, 96.1% to 97.7%). HSCT from HIDs had a lower risk of mixed chimerism (HR, .078; P = .022). Within 100 days after transplantation, 31 patients (19.6%; 95% CI, 14.0% to 26.3%) had grade II-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD), 9 of whom had grade III-IV aGVHD (5.7%; 95% CI, 2.9% to 10.1%). HIDs were significantly associated with a higher risk of grade II-IV aGVHD (HR, 3.973; P = .009). Nineteen patients (11.9%; 95% CI, 7.6% to 17.6%) developed late aGVHD after a median of 516 days (95% CI, 407 to 709 days). Twenty-six patients (16.5%; 95% CI, 11.3% to 22.8%) exhibited any 1 of the diagnostic, distinctive, or atypical features of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) according to the 2014 National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria after a median of 690 days (95% CI, 496 to 902 days). Among these 26 patients, 7 had NIH-defined cGVHD, 14 had only 1 distinctive sign with no histologic evidence, and 5 had only atypical cGVHD signs. Of the 26 patients, 5 were classified with overlap syndrome. Of 21 patients classified with NIH-defined and potential cGVHD, 3 had moderate cGVHD and 1 had severe cGVHD. Logistic regression analyses identified that grade II-IV aGVHD independently predicted subsequent cGVHD (HR, 3.920; P = .006). The rates of cGVHD were similar in the matched donor and HID groups. Thalassemia-free survival (TFS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 97.5% (95% CI, 94.2% to 99.2%) and 90.6% (95% CI, 85.4% to 94.4%), respectively, after a median of 690 days (95% CI, 496 to 902 days). TFS rates were similar in the matched donor and HID groups (P = .549). The EFS rate was significantly higher in the matched donor group compared to the HID group (P = .033). Our study suggests that when PTCy-based uniform GVHD prophylaxis is administered, HSCT from matched donors and HIDs results in a low incidence of severe GVHD and treatment-related mortality with satisfactory survival."

    "abstract": "Graft rejection and Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are some of the significant factors resulting in morbidity and mortality following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Prophylaxis for GVHD using T-cell depleting agents is helpful in reducing the transplant-related mortality and graft rejection. Both tATG and fATG exhibit varied amounts of antibody specificities and perform distinct immunomodulatory effects, regardless of their capacity to deplete T-lymphocytes. We conducted this single-center, retrospective study at our center to compare both formulations. Twenty-six patients were included in the study, 13 in each cohort. The median age at diagnosis of β-thalassemia was 5 months (range, 3-12 months) in the tATG group and 6 months (range, 3-9 months) in the f-ATG group, respectively. Acute GVHD was observed in 1 (7.7) and 2(15.4) in the tATG and fATG group, respectively. No cases of chronic GVHD were observed in either group. There was no difference in the mixed chimerism observed at 6 months in both groups, tATG (<i>n</i> = 5, 38.5%) and fATG (<i>n</i> = 6, 46.15). There was 1 (7.6) rejection at day +72 observed in the tATG group, whereas no rejection was observed in the fATG group. At a mean follow-up duration of 288 days since transplant, there were no deaths in either of the groups. In conclusion, both ATG preparations showed equivalent effectiveness in preventing rejections and GVHD. However, further larger studies are required to establish the long-term efficacy and safety of both formulations in ASCT."

This study aimed to ascertain the levels of calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in children with β-thalassemia. In this case-control study, 36 children with major β-thalassemia receiving iron chelation therapy were included. For the control group, 36 cases matched for age and sex were selected. The packed cell volume (PCV) requirements varied among the thalassemic children, with an average PCV requirement of 78.57±49.07. The study was conducted for six months in the Department of Pediatrics at the Government Medical College, Nagpur, India. Serum PTH levels were determined by immunoassay, and serum vitamin D levels were assessed using electrochemiluminescence technique. Additional tests looked at liver function, serum ferritin, calcium, phosphorus, and complete blood count. The student's t-test, Mann-Whitney, and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. In comparison to the control group (10.4±1.21 g/dL), the case group's mean hemoglobin level was considerably lower (5.62±1.9 g/dL) (p<0.001). The mean serum ferritin level in the cases was notably higher (3073±1262.24 ng/mL) compared to the control group's level (58.37±29.67 ng/mL) (p<0.001). A total of 80.6% of cases compared to 5.6% of controls had vitamin D deficiency, and 72.2% of cases compared to 2.8% of controls had PTH deficit, both of which showed statistically significant differences (p<0.001). Significant differences were observed between the case and control groups for the mean levels of total serum calcium (8.51±0.84 mg/dL), vitamin D (15.23±10.07 ng/mL), and PTH (14.66±19.86 pg/mL) (9.13±0.6 mg/dL, p=0.05; 34.94±9.57 ng/mL, p<0.001; 32.08±12.42 pg/mL, p<0.001; respectively). Growth failure may result from the markedly reduced serum calcium, vitamin D, and PTH levels in children with β-thalassemia. The relevance of treatment approaches is highlighted by the possibility that these anomalies are caused by excessive iron and inadequate nutritional support."

    "abstract": "Excess iron deriving from a chronic transfusion and dietary intake increases the risk for cardiac complications in β-thalassemia major patients. Deferiprone and deferasirox are commonly prescribed to thalassemic patients who are at risk of iron overload. This study aimed to compare the performance and toxicity of deferiprone and deferasirox in β-thalassemia major patients. A cross-sectional observation was performed on 102 patients with β-thalassemia major. Serum ferritin along with total, indirect, and direct bilirubin levels were measured. Levels of liver enzymes, transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST), were also determined. Ferritin correlations with serum ALT, AST, and total bilirubin were constructed based on Spearman's rank correlation. Statistical differences based on the serum parameters were analyzed between deferiprone and deferasirox groups. The differences of iron chelators' effects between those receiving short-term (≤7 years) and long-term (>7 years) blood transfusion were also analyzed. The averaged levels of bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ferritin were found to be high. Ferritin was positively correlated with ALT (r=0.508 and <i>p</i><0.001) and AST ((r=0.569; p<0.001). There was no statistical difference in ferritin levels between the deferiprone and deferasirox groups ( <i>p</i>=0.776). However, higher total bilirubin and ALT were observed in the deferasirox group than in the deferiprone group ( <i>p</i>=0.001 and 0.022, respectively). Total ( <i>p</i><0.001), indirect ( <i>p</i><0.001), and direct bilirubin levels ( <i>p</i>=0.015) were significantly higher in patients with long-term transfusions than those receiving short-term transfusions. Higher ferritin was found with a statistical significance of <i>p</i>=0.008 in the long-term transfusions group. Ferritin is high in people with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major and positively correlated with ALT and AST. Deferasirox might pose a higher risk of developing hepatic injury as compared with deferiprone. Yet, no significant change of deferasirox efficacy (based on ferritin level) was found between those receiving short-term and long-term transfusions."

There are an estimated 270 million carriers of hemoglobinopathies (abnormal hemoglobins and/or thalassemia) worldwide, necessitating global methods and solutions for effective and optimal therapy. LMICs are disproportionately impacted by thalassemia, and due to disparities in genomics awareness and diagnostic resources, certain LMICs lag behind high-income countries (HICs). This spurred the establishment of the Global Globin Network (GGN) in 2015 at UNESCO, Paris, as a project-wide endeavor within the Human Variome Project (HVP). Primarily aimed at enhancing thalassemia clinical services, research, and genomic diagnostic capabilities with a focus on LMIC needs, GGN aims to foster data collection in a shared database by all affected nations, thus improving data sharing and thalassemia management. In this paper, we propose a minimum requirement for establishing a genomic database in thalassemia based on the HVP database guidelines. We suggest using an existing platform recommended by HVP, the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) (https://www.lovd.nl/). Adoption of our proposed criteria will assist in improving or supplementing the existing databases, allowing for better-quality services for individuals with thalassemia.

    "title": "The predicting formula and scoring system for cardiac iron overload for thalassaemia children: Study from a middle-income country.",
    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging T2* screening is the gold standard for detecting cardiac iron overload in thalassemia, but its implementation in Indonesia is limited by the high costs. A predicting formula and scoring system based on low-cost investigations is needed. This cross-sectional study was conducted among thalassemia aged 6-18 years at Rumah Sakit Anak dan Bunda RSAB Harapan Kita Indonesia, during October 2017 to April 2019. All subjects were scheduled for clinical examination, laboratory tests, ECGs, echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, and MRIT2*. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the formula, simplifying to a scoring system, and risk classification for myocardial iron overload using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Significance was set as p<0,05. We recruited 80 children, of those, 8 (10%) were classified as cardiac iron overload based on MRI T2* screening. Multivariate logistic regression showed determinant factors for cardiac iron overload were hemoglobin (95% CI:1.92-369.14), reticulocyte (95% CI:1.14-232.33), mitral deceleration time (DT) (95% CI:1.80-810.62,), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR Vmax) (95% CI:1.87-1942.56) with aOR of 26.65, 14.27, 38.22, and 60.27 respectively. The formula for cardiac iron overload was decided as 9.32 + 3.28 (Hb) + 2.9 (reticulocyte) + 3.64 (DT) + 4.1 (TR Vmax). A scoring system was defined by simplifying the formula of Hb ≤ 8.2 g/L, reticulocyte ≤0.33%, DT ≤ 114.5 cm/s, and TR Vmax ≥ 2.37 m/s were given a score of 1, while others were assigned 0. Total scores of 0 or 1, 2 and 3 or 4 were categorized as low, moderate, and high risk for iron cardiac overload. The cardiac iron overload formula was 9.32 + 3.28 (Hb) + 2.9 (reticulocyte) + 3.64 (DT) + 4.1 (TR Vmax). Variables of Hb ≤ 8.2 g/L, reticulocyte ≤0.33%, DT ≤ 114.5 cm/s, and TR Vmax ≥ 2.37 m/s were given a score of 1, while others were assigned 0. Total scores of 0 or 1, 2, and 3 or 4 were categorized as low, moderate, and high risk for iron cardiac overload."

    "title": "NSUN2 is critical for mouse oocyte meiosis and early embryonic development.",
    "abstract": "The mechanism by which the NSUN2 mutation causes female infertility is still unclear. This study reveals the role and potential mechanism of NSUN2 in mouse oocyte maturation and early embryonic development, and provides a resource for elucidating female infertility with NSUN2 mutations. Biallelic variants in the NSUN2 gene cause a rare intellectual disability and female infertility in humans. However, the function and mechanism of NSUN2 during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic development are unknown. Here, we show that NSUN2 is important for mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic development. Specifically, NSUN2 is required for ovarian development and oocyte meiosis, and deletion of Nsun2 reduces oocyte maturation and increases the rates of misaligned chromosomes and aberrant spindles. In addition, Nsun2 deficiency results in a low blastocyst rate and impaired blastocyst quality. Strikingly, loss of Nsun2 leads to approximately 35% of embryos being blocked at the 2-cell stage, and Nsun2 knockdown impairs zygotic genome activation at the 2-cell stage. Taken together, these findings suggest that NSUN2 plays a critical role in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic development, and provide key resources for elucidating female infertility with NSUN2 mutations."

    "title": "Anti-infectivity efficacy and pharmacokinetics of WHO recommended single low-dose primaquine in children with acute Plasmodium falciparum in Burkina Faso: study protocol.",
    "abstract": "Primaquine (PQ) has activity against mature P. falciparum gametocytes and proven transmission blocking efficacy (TBE) between humans and mosquitoes. WHO formerly recommended a single transmission blocking dose of 0.75 mg/kg but this was little used. Then in 2012, faced with the emergence of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum (ARPf) in SE Asia, the WHO recommended a lower dose of 0.25 mg/kg to be added to artemisinin-based combination therapy in falciparum-infected patients in low transmission areas. This dose was considered safe in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) and not requiring G6PD testing. Subsequent single low-dose primaquine (SLDPQ) studies have demonstrated safety in different G6PD variants. Dosing remains challenging in children under the age of 5 because of the paucity of PQ pharmacokinetic (PK) data. We plan to assess the anti-infectivity efficacy of SLDPQ using an allometrically scaled, weight-based regimen, with a target dose of 0.25 mg/kg, in children with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This study is an open label, randomised 1:1, phase IIb study to assess TBE, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and acceptability of artesunate pyronaridine (ASPYR) administered alone or combined with SLDPQ in 56 Burkinabe children aged ≥ 6 months- < 5 years, with uncomplicated P. falciparum and a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of ≥ 5 g/dL. We will assess TBE, using direct membrane feeding assays (DMFA), and further investigate PQ pharmacokinetics, adverse events, Hb dynamics, G6PD, sickle cells, thalassaemia and cytochrome 2D6 (CYP2D6) status, acceptability of flavoured PQ [CAST-ClinSearch Acceptability Score Test<sup>®</sup>], and the population's knowledge, attitude and practices on malaria. We expect children to accept tablets, confirm the TBE and gametocytocidal effects of SLDPQ and then construct a PK infectivity model (including age, sex, baseline Hb, G6PD and CYP2D6 status) to define the dose response TBE relationship that may lead to fine tuning our SLDPQ regimen. Our study will complement others that have examined factors associated with Hb dynamics and PQ PK. It will provide much needed, high-quality evidence of SLDPQ in sick African children and provide reassurance that SLDPQ should be used as a strategy against emerging ARPf in Africa. ISRCTN16297951.

    "title": "The prototypical UK blood donor, homophily and blood donation: Blood donors are like you, not me.",
    "abstract": "Homophily represents the extent to which people feel others are like them and encourages the uptake of activities they feel people like them do. Currently, there are no data on blood donor homophily with respect to (i) people's representation of the average prototypical UK blood donor and (ii) the degree of homophily with this prototype for current donors, non-donors, groups blood services wish to encourage (ethnic minorities), those who are now eligible following policy changes (e.g., men-who-have-sex-with-men: MSM) and recipients. We aim to fill these gaps in knowledge. We surveyed the UK general population MSM, long-term blood recipients, current donors, non-donors and ethnic minorities (n = 785) to assess perceptions of the prototypical donor in terms of ethnicity, age, gender, social class, educational level and political ideology. Homophily was indexed with respect to age, gender and ethnicity. The prototypical UK blood donor is perceived as White, middle-aged, middle-class, college-level educated and left-wing. Current donors and MSM are more homophilous with this prototype, whereas recipients and ethnic minorities have the lowest homophily. Higher levels of homophily are associated with an increased likelihood of committing to donate. The prototype of the UK donor defined this as a White activity. This, in part, may explain why ethnic minorities are less likely to be donors. As well as traditional recruitment strategies, blood services need to consider broader structural changes such as the ethnic diversity of staff and co-designing donor spaces with local communities."

    "title": "An evaluation of exagamglogene autotemcel for the treatment of sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia.",
    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy followed by beta-thalassemia. Until recently, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was the only curative approach. Based on the Crispr-Cas9-technology enabling targeting specific genes of interest, fetal hemoglobin which is normally shut-off after birth can be switched on and sufficient levels can alleviate symptoms in sickle cell disease and avoid transfusions in beta-thalassemia. Two first-in-human clinical studies in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia aiming to increase the level of fetal hemoglobin by using Crispr-Cas9 to modify autologous hematopoietic stem cells in patients aged 12-35 years have proved safety and efficacy and have shown promising clinical outcomes. The paper summarizes the outcome of the results of the two recently published clinical studies and compares them with the other available curative approaches. Based on the currently available safety and efficacy data of the two published clinical results on gene therapy with Crispr-Cas9 modified autologous stem cells (exagamglogene autotemcel), it can be anticipated that this approach will add significantly to the therapeutic options for patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia and can be considered for all patients above 12 years of age independent of a suitable allogeneic stem cell donor."

    "abstract": "Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by developmental delays, distinct facial features, and a variety of systemic manifestations. We present a case of a 28-year-old male previously misdiagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome who exhibited recurrent generalized weakness, fever, fatigue, and significant hemoglobin drops requiring multiple blood transfusions due to thalassemia major. The patient displayed characteristic CS features, including developmental delays, distinct facial characteristics, morbid obesity, and heterochromia iridis. Severe gastrointestinal bleeding led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) via colonoscopy. Management included blood transfusions, hydrocortisone, mesalamine, and azathioprine, resulting in stabilized UC and improved overall health. CS presents with a spectrum of clinical features that overlap with other syndromic conditions, necessitating careful differential diagnosis. Early diagnosis and supportive care significantly improve quality of life and help manage complications effectively."

    "abstract": "Red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a genetic disorder affecting the enzyme PK in red blood cells. A deficiency in PK leads to hemolytic anemia. Hypertriglyceridemia means elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. The hypertriglyceridemia disorder can be primary or secondary to an underlying disease. Hypertriglyceridemia with β-thalassemia major is a known association and is called hypertriglyceridemia-thalassemia syndrome. A four-month-old male child was found to have milky serum. On investigation, there was severe anemia, with triglycerides at 1197 mg/dL and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The child had severe pallor, mild icterus, a dysmorphic face, and splenohepatomegaly. Ophthalmic examination showed lipemia retinitis. The child was treated with medium-chain fatty acid formula feed. Regular blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, and avoidance of salicylate group drugs were advised. The child improved and is doing well. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment can change the prognosis and help maintain a near-normal life for affected infants."

    "abstract": "When deferasirox is used in iron chelation therapy, maculopapular rash occurs in 10% of patients, but there is no accepted and implemented protocol for the management of these drug reactions in adults. A 23-year-old woman diagnosed with thalassemia major is presented. She had taken 1,500 mg oral deferasirox for 1 week. Five hours after the last dose, a pruritic maculopapular rash developed on the body, face, and hands. The rash spread to the whole body within 3 days. The absolute necessity for the patient to take the drug was clarified by the hematology department. The patient's history was evaluated. A delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction due to deferasirox was considered. The slow desensitization protocol described in the literature and applied on a case-by-case basis in pediatric patients was modified to shorten the duration by determining appropriate doses for the current preparation. The desensitization process was started with 1/100,000 of the total dose and the therapeutic dose was reached with a 2- to 2.5-fold increase in dose. No pre-medication was applied. During the procedure, at a low dose of 0.1 mg, local flushing and erythema was observed around the auricle on the face. The reaction did not progress. Slow desensitization protocol for oral deferasirox was successfully applied in an adult patient."
