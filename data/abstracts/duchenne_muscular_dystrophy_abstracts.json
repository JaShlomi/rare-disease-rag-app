    "title": "Multi-Modal Analysis of Satellite Cells Reveals Early Impairments at Pre-Contractile Stages of Myogenesis in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies on myogenic satellite cells (SCs) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) documented altered division capacities and impaired regeneration potential of SCs in DMD patients and animal models. It remains unknown, however, if SC-intrinsic effects trigger these deficiencies at pre-contractile stages of myogenesis rather than resulting from the pathologic environment. In this study, we isolated SCs from a porcine DMD model and age-matched wild-type (WT) piglets for comprehensive analysis. Using immunofluorescence, differentiation assays, traction force microscopy (TFM), RNA-seq, and label-free proteomic measurements, SCs behavior was characterized, and molecular changes were investigated. TFM revealed significantly higher average traction forces in DMD than WT SCs (90.4 ± 10.5 Pa vs. 66.9 ± 8.9 Pa; <i>p</i> = 0.0018). We identified 1390 differentially expressed genes and 1261 proteins with altered abundance in DMD vs. WT SCs. Dysregulated pathways uncovered by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis included sarcomere organization, focal adhesion, and response to hypoxia. Multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, identified five factors accounting for the observed variance with an overall higher contribution of the transcriptomic data. Our findings suggest that SC impairments result from their inherent genetic abnormality rather than from environmental influences. The observed biological changes are intrinsic and not reactive to the pathological surrounding of DMD muscle."

    "title": "DWORF expression is reduced in a large animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle-wasting disease driven by cytosolic calcium overload, which leads to muscle degeneration. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a key regulator of cytosolic calcium levels, exhibits reduced activity in animal models of DMD and human patients. Dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), a positive SERCA regulator, is downregulated in mdx DMD mice, and adeno-associated virus-mediated DWORF overexpression has been shown to ameliorate DMD cardiomyopathy. The canine DMD model provides a crucial bridge for translating findings from mice to humans. To investigate DWORF expression in this model, we developed a canine-specific anti-DWORF antibody, as the existing murine antibody is ineffective. This antibody detected DWORF in human, pig, cat and rabbit muscle, but not in mouse muscle. DWORF was absent in muscle tissues of neonatal normal dogs but highly expressed in those of adult dogs. In DMD-affected dogs aged 8 months or older, DWORF expression was significantly reduced in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. This study establishes a foundation for evaluating DWORF-based gene therapy in the canine DMD model, advancing the potential for clinical translation."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked neuromuscular disorder with limited therapeutic options, highlighting the urgent need for novel treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated the role of FBXL3 in DMD pathogenesis and assessed its potential as a gene therapy target. Using mdx mice, a well-established preclinical model of DMD, we found that satellite cell-specific deletion of FBXL3 significantly improved muscle pathology and functional performance. FBXL3-deficient mdx mice exhibited increased body and muscle mass, along with enhanced grip strength and endurance capacity. Histological analyses demonstrated a marked increase in both the number and cross-sectional area of centrally nucleated fibers, indicative of enhanced regenerative activity. These changes were associated with elevated myogenin expression and reduced inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that FBXL3 functions as a negative regulator of muscle repair. Moreover, targeted FBXL3 silencing via adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery to the gastrocnemius muscle resulted in increased muscle mass and further upregulation of myogenin, supporting its therapeutic relevance. Together, these findings identify FBXL3 as a key modulator of muscle regeneration via repression of myogenin and provide compelling evidence for its inhibition as a promising gene therapy strategy in DMD."

    "abstract": "Expanded carrier screening (ECS) enables proactive identification of at-risk couples (ARCs) and individuals, facilitating informed reproductive decision-making through genetic counseling. This study evaluates the clinical utility of ECS among the population in Anhui Province, China, where its implementation remains understudied. Retrospectively analysis of genetic testing results assessed the carrier frequencies for targeted diseases, identified prevalent pathogenic genes and variants, and ARCs detection rate alongside associated reproductive choices and pregnancy outcomes. In this single-center retrospective study (June 2020-October 2023), 2,530 reproductive-aged individuals (486 couples; 1,558 individuals) underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based ECS using a customized panel targeting 152 recessive monogenic disorders. Carrier rates, pathogenic variants, ARC detection, and subsequent reproductive outcomes were analyzed. Overall, 38.50% (974/2,530) of participants carried ≥ 1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. The most prevalent autosomal recessive (AR) disorders included DFNB4 (3.08%), DFNB1A (2.81%), Wilson disease (2.57%), Krabbe disease (2.37%), and phenylketonuria (2.13%). Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD, 0.28%) was the most common X-linked (XL) disorder. Twenty ARCs (4.12%, 20/486) were identified, including sixteen pregnant couples. Among these, 56.25% (9/16) opted for invasive prenatal diagnosis, confirming eight unaffected fetuses with healthy live births and one twin pregnancy requiring selective termination of an affected fetus. Five pregnant ARCs declined prenatal diagnosis, four of whom delivered healthy infants, while one pregnancy was terminated due to structural anomalies. Of three non-pregnant ARCs, two pursued preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M), resulting in one healthy birth. Our study demonstrated that the ECS for reproductive-age individuals can identify couples and individuals at risk of conceiving a child with a recessive genetic disorder and support reproductive choices through the provision of genetic counseling to reduce the likelihood of offspring with congenital anomalies."

    "abstract": "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), lack of the shorter dystrophin isoforms Dp140 and Dp71 is associated with increased central nervous system (CNS) involvement. We aimed to investigate how CNS involvement affects motor development in young DMD boys. Three hundred and forty-two DMD boys aged 3-6 years were subdivided according to DMD mutation expected effects on isoform expression: Group 1 (Dp427 absent, Dp140/Dp71 present, n = 170); Group 2 (Dp427/Dp140 absent, Dp71 present, n = 154) and Group 3 (Dp427/Dp140/Dp71 absent, n = 18). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to investigate relationships between isoform group and the odds of achieving higher North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) subitem scores for 15 subitems, adjusting for age at visit and glucocorticoid exposure. The odds of achieving a full score of 2 were significantly lower for 11 NSAA subitems in Group 2 compared to Group 1, 5 NSAA subitems in Group 3 compared to Group 1, and 2 NSAA subitems in Group 3 compared to Group 2. The odds of achieving a score of 2 or 1 compared to 0 were significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 1 for the 2 NSAA subitems studied using this comparison. We found strong and significant associations between the odds of achieving higher NSAA subitem scores and expected patterns of dystrophin isoform involvement, with a cumulative effect of loss of isoforms. This suggests an important relationship between dystrophin isoforms in the brain and the ability to carry out gross motor milestones."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): is a rare, life-limiting genetic disorder for which no curative treatment currently exists. While various gene therapy approaches, some approved and others still under clinical investigation have been explored, they have not consistently produced the desired outcome and, in some cases, have been associated with serious adverse effects, including mortality. A critical factor we wish to highlight is the hostile inflammatory environment inherent to skeletal muscles' pathology in DMD, which may be further aggravated by gene therapy, either due to the viral vector used or the gene component itself. Therefore, a comparative and detailed evaluation of inflammatory biomarkers between control and treatment arms in such clinical trials is essential to determine whether therapeutic benefits are being compromised by inflammation. Based on the implications of such hostile environment on the therapeutic outcome, adding a safer and efficacious management strategy to mitigate the inflammation during gene therapies is considered indispensable. Therefore, we recommend further research on adjuvant anti-inflammatory approaches to ensure safety and improvement of the therapeutic outcome of gene therapies for DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disease that is characterized by progressive proximal muscle weakness and pseudohypertrophy. Currently, genetic diagnosis of DMD relies largely on multiplex ligation-dependent probe analysis (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing to identify pathogenic mutations. This study aimed to confirm the genetic etiology of a boy presenting with clinical manifestations that are highly indicative of DMD. A 14-year-old boy with heart failure and extreme muscle weakness along with his family members was recruited for this study. DNA from each participant was isolated from peripheral blood samples. We used MLPA to detect the deletion or duplication mutations of the <i>DMD</i> gene and Sanger sequencing to verify the missing region of the exon in the proband. Furthermore, the functional role of the mutation was assessed using bioinformatics. We found that the proband carried a small deletion in the <i>DMD</i> gene (c.6808_6811delTTAA). The deletion of those four nucleotides resulted in a frameshift mutation and a premature nonsense codon, which resulted in a truncated dystrophin that lost its most critical function and underwent post-transcriptional degradation. Our study demonstrated that MLPA, in combination with Sanger sequencing, is a reliable and practical approach for the genetic diagnosis of DMD, which is a significant step towards developing personalized therapy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. DMD is reported to coexist with other comorbidities, although the occurrence of the triad, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy is very rare. Indeed, only one case of the triad has currently been reported. Here, we present a detailed case report of a ten-year-old boy with DMD, ASD, and epilepsy. We also investigated the dysregulation of miRNAs in this unusual triad (represented as DMD++) compared with a healthy individual and a DMD patient (represented as DMD+) without autism. To understand the differential expression of miRNAs in rare comorbid DMD cases. The Sequin Form Board test, Gesell's drawing test, multiplex ligation probe amplification, and Vineland Social Maturity Scale were applied to confirm the DMD and ASD. Total RNA was isolated from samples using TRIzol. cDNA was synthesized using the Mir-X™ miRNA First-Strand Synthesis kit. qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Advantage qPCR Premix. The results were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's <i>t</i>-test. miR-146a-5p and miR-132-5p showed significant downregulation in both patient samples. miR-199a-5p and miR-146a-3p showed no change in expression between the diseased and controls. miR-132-3p showed downregulation only in the DMD+ sample (0.21 ± 0.04). The decrease in miR-132-3p can result in failed silencing of the phosphatase and tensin homolog-mediated apoptotic pathway, leading to severe skeletal muscle atrophy. Here, the downregulation of miR-132-3p in DMD+ is consistent with severe muscle loss and higher disease progression than that in DMD++. DMD++ has slower disease progression, and the expression of miRNA involved in inflammatory and apoptotic responses is more similar to that of the control. Our study shows marked difference in miRNA expression in this rare case of DMD with autism and epilepsy. These miRNAs also serve as regulators of several muscle regeneration, apoptosis, and inflammatory pathways. This study shows the significance of studying miRNAs in such rare cases in a larger cohort to progress in several intervention treatments utilizing miRNAs."

    "abstract": "Pain is a recognized symptom of muscular dystrophy (MD), but little is known about prescription pain medications in this population. We describe pain experiences and pain medications prescribed for individuals with selected MDs using population-based surveillance data collected by the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network. Pain and prescription data were abstracted from medical records for 1282 individuals with Duchenne and Becker (DBMD) MD during 2000-2015 and congenital (CMD), distal (DD), Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD), facioscapulohumeral (FSHD), limb-girdle (LGMD), and myotonic (DM) MDs during 2008-2016. Percentages of individuals prescribed pain medications for ≥ 6 weeks during follow-up were estimated. Logistic regression was used to examine associations with selected demographic and clinical characteristics. Moderate pain was observed among 34% of all people with available pain scores and varied by MD type (13%-53%). Pain medications were prescribed for 31.1%-40.2% of people 20 years and older, but less frequently (< 15%) among people less than 20 years old. Among people prescribed pain medications, the first medication was typically a non-opioid (57%), but both non-opioid and opioid medication classes were prescribed during follow-up (34%). Pain medications were typically prescribed for longer than 1 year (> 85%). Impaired mobility had the strongest association with prescription pain medication. The prescription of pain medication is common for people with symptomatic MD. Most people were prescribed only non-opioids. These data highlight pain management as a frequent component of MD care. Understanding modifiable factors associated with MD-related pain and effective interventions may help improve care."

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is the age-related degeneration of skeletal muscle, resulting in loss of skeletal muscle tone, mass, and quality. Skeletal muscle is a source of systemic metabolites and macromolecules important for neuronal health, function, and healthy neuronal aging. Age-related loss of skeletal muscle might result in decreased metabolite and macromolecule availability, resulting in reduced neuronal function or increased susceptibility to unhealthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We aimed to identify muscle metabolite candidates that regulate healthy aging. C57BL/6J mice were aged to young adult (4 months) and old age (25 months) and skeletal muscle was collected. Age-related muscle loss was confirmed by reduced muscle mass, muscle fiber degeneration, reduced myosin intensity, in addition to a metabolic shift and increased DNA damage in skeletal muscle. Using a low molecular weight enriched metabolomics protocol, we assessed the metabolic profile of skeletal muscle from young adult and old age mice and identified 20 metabolites that were significantly changed in aged muscle. These metabolite candidates were tested in C. elegans assays of lifespan, healthspan, muscle, and mitochondrial morphology under normal and stressed conditions. We identified four metabolite candidates (beta-alanine, 4-guanidinobutanoic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, pantothenic acid) that, when supplemented in C. elegans provided robust gero- and mitochondrial protection. These candidates also affected life-, and health- span in C. elegans models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Our findings support that aging muscle can be used to identify novel metabolite modulators of lifespan and health and may show promise for future treatments of neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders."

    "title": "Identifying kinematic biomarkers of the dystrophic phenotype in a zebrafish model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Dystrophin-deficient zebrafish larvae are a small, genetically tractable vertebrate model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy that is well suited for early-stage therapeutic development. However, current approaches for evaluating their mobility, a physiologically relevant therapeutic outcome, yield data of low resolution and high variability that provides minimal insight into potential mechanisms responsible for their abnormal locomotion. To address these issues, we used high speed videography and deep learning-based markerless motion capture to quantify escape response (ER) swimming kinematics of two dystrophic zebrafish strains (sapje and sapje-like). Each ER was partitioned into an initiating C-start, a subsequent power stroke, and a final burst of undulatory swimming activity. Markerless motion capture provided repeatable, high precision estimates of swimming kinematics. Random forest and support vector machine prediction models identified overall ER distance and peak speed, the instantaneous speed conferred by the power stroke, and the average speed and distance covered during burst swimming as the most predictive biomarkers for differentiating dystrophic from wild-type larvae. For each of these predictors, mutant and wild-type larvae differed markedly with effect sizes ranging from 2.4 to 3.7 standard deviations. To identify mechanisms underlying these performance deficits, we evaluated the amplitude and frequency of propulsive tail movements. There was little evidence that tail stroke amplitude was affected by the absence of dystrophin. Instead, temporal aspects of tail kinematics, including tail maximal angular velocity during the C-start and power stroke and tail stroke frequency during burst swimming, were slowed in mutants. In fact, tail kinematics were as effective as direct, non-survival in vitro assessments of tail muscle contractility in differentiating mutant from wild-type larvae. ER kinematics can be used as precise and physiologically relevant biomarkers of the dystrophic phenotype, may serve as non-lethal proxies for skeletal muscle dysfunction, and reveal new insights into why mobility is impaired in the absence of dystrophin. The approach outlined here opens new possibilities for the design and interpretation of studies using zebrafish to model movement disorders."

This single-center, retrospective study reviewed medical records of 459 Asian patients with genetically or biopsy-confirmed DMD, aged 1-48 years, from September 1, 2010, to January 1, 2023. Constipation was the most common complication, affecting 149 patients (32.5 %), followed by dysphagia in 43 patients (9.4 %). Other conditions included irritable bowel syndrome in 8, gastroesophageal reflux disease in 7, hemorrhoids in 6, acute dilatation of stomach in 4, sigmoid colon volvulus in 2, and pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis in 2. Additionally, 1 case each of appendicitis, esophageal diverticulum, paralytic ileus, aerophagia, anal atresia, malabsorption syndrome, fecal incontinence, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and rectal prolapse was observed. Treatments for constipation included no intervention in 20 patients (13.4 %), sodium picosulfate hydrate in 62 (41.6 %), magnesium oxide in 59 (39.6 %), and polyethylene glycol 4000 in 20 (13.4 %). Logistic regression analysis showed that body mass index (BMI), age and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor use was significantly associated with constipation. This study highlighted constipation as the most frequent gastrointestinal complication in DMD and identified several rare but serious complications, offering key insights into real-world clinical practice."

DMD patients have been enrolled in the Advanced Cardiac Therapies Improving Outcomes Network (ACTION) Dystrophinopathy Registry since 2021. Cardiac medication use was analyzed at enrollment and most recent follow-up. CDMT was defined as concurrent use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) /angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) plus beta-blocker (BB) plus mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Two hundred sixty-five males with DMD (median age 17.5 (IQR 14.5-21.5) years) were prospectively followed; median follow-up was 11.5 (IQR 6.2-15.6) months. At most recent follow-up, 153 patients (57.7%) had decreased LV systolic function, 67 (25.3% of the cohort) had moderate or severe dysfunction. For patients with moderate or severe dysfunction, CDMT was used for 49/67 (73.1%) at most recent follow-up, similar to 36/51 (70.6%) at enrollment (p = 0.92). Target doses of CDMT were achieved for 27% of males on ACEi/ARB/ARNI, 28% on BB, and 23% on MRA. Initial analysis of a prospective registry of males with DMD showed that ~ 30% of patients with moderate or severe LV dysfunction were not on CDMT at most recent follow-up and the majority did not reach target dosing. Further understanding regarding the optimal combination of cardiac medications for DMD cardiomyopathy is needed, as is a better understanding of the barriers to CDMT optimization given increasing cardiac causes of death for DMD patients."

RNA therapeutics encompass diverse molecules like antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), RNA aptamers, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which can function through different mechanisms. RNA therapeutics are witnessing expanding applications across a range of diseases, notably in the treatment of neurological disorders. For instance, ASO therapies like nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy and eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy exemplify successful RNA therapeutic strategies. Emerging ASO treatments for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are also promising, with ongoing clinical trials demonstrating significant reductions in disease-associated proteins. Still, delivery of these molecules remains a pivotal challenge in RNA therapeutics, especially for ASOs in penetrating the blood-brain barrier to target neurological disorders effectively. Nanoparticlebased formulations have emerged as leading strategies to enhance RNA stability, reduce immunogenicity, and improve cellular uptake. Despite these advances, significant hurdles remain, including optimizing pharmacokinetics, minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring sustained therapeutic efficacy. Regulatory frameworks are evolving to accommodate the unique challenges of RNAbased therapies, including ASOs with efforts underway to establish comprehensive guidelines for RNA therapeutics, yet there are also sustainable manufacturing issues that need to be considered for long-term feasibility. By addressing these challenges, RNA therapeutics hold immense potential to revolutionize treatment paradigms for neurological disorders. Looking forward, the future of RNA therapeutics in neurology appears promising but requires continued interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation."

    "abstract": "Peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity is preserved in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in early disease, despite profound diaphragm muscle weakness and reduced electrical activation, revealing adequate compensation by extra-diaphragmatic muscles. Respiratory system compensation is lost as disease progresses, with the emergence of reduced peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity in advanced disease. We hypothesised that extra-diaphragmatic inspiratory muscles compensate for diaphragm dysfunction in early dystrophic disease, supporting the maintenance of peak respiratory performance in mdx mice. We reasoned that extra-diaphragmatic muscle dysfunction would emerge with progressive disease, leading to the loss of peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity in advanced dystrophic disease. We measured ventilation, inspiratory pressure, and obligatory (diaphragm, intercostal and parasternal) and accessory (sternomastoid, cleidomastoid, scalene and trapezius) respiratory muscle form, function and EMG activity in early (4 months) and advanced (16 months) dystrophic disease. Despite obligatory and accessory muscle dysfunction, including structural remodelling, weakness and reduced EMG activity, peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity and ventilation are preserved in early disease. Obligatory and accessory muscle dysfunction progressively declines with advanced disease, with the emergence of reduced peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity. However, although there was evidence of progressive accessory muscle dysfunction, more profound remodelling was seen in the diaphragm muscle comparing early and advanced dystrophic disease. In conclusion, in early dystrophic disease, peak inspiratory performance is compensated. A progressive decline in diaphragm and extra-diaphragmatic muscles contributes to respiratory system compromise in advanced disease. Further loss of compensation afforded by extra-diaphragmatic muscles probably contributes to end-stage respiratory failure. KEY POINTS: We characterised obligatory and accessory respiratory muscle form, function and control in early and advanced disease in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Profound diaphragm muscle remodelling, immune cell infiltration, elevated cytokine concentrations and dysfunction present in early disease, but peak inspiratory performance is fully compensated. The burden of breathing is shared across many muscles, revealed as remodelling, elevated cytokine concentrations, weakness and impaired control in several obligatory and accessory muscles. Peak inspiratory performance declines in advanced disease with evidence of progressive remodelling in the diaphragm muscle with extensive fibrosis and further decline in the form, function and control of accessory muscles of breathing. Diaphragm remodelling with profound fibrosis, more so than progressive accessory muscle remodelling (although evident), is the striking phenotype at 16 months of age when the decline in peak inspiratory performance appears. The progressive decline to end-stage disease (∼20-22 months of age in mdx mice) probably relates to continued profound loss of diaphragm contractile function and loss of compensatory support provided by extra-diaphragmatic muscles. Logistically convenient models of rapid, progressive muscular dystrophy are required to facilitate the study of end-stage disease."

Elevated ADAMTS-5 protease activity results in proinflammatory matrikines, including versikine. Here, we hypothesized that targeting ADAMTS-5 with the small-molecule inhibitor GLPG1972 could decrease dystrophic pathology. Using versikine as a marker of target engagement, we observed a robust reduction in human serum after up to 52 weeks of treatment with GLPG1972, confirming inhibition of ADAMTS-5 catalytic activity. Treatment of C57.muscular dystrophy x-linked (<i>mdx</i>) mice with GLPG1972, alone or in combination with the standard-of-care prednisolone, increased forelimb grip strength and force output of diaphragm muscles ex vivo when compared with vehicle treatment, and improvements in function were associated with decreased diaphragm inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment of C57.<i>mdx</i> mice with prednisolone also decreased diaphragm inflammation; however, grip strength, diaphragm force output, and fibrosis did not significantly differ from vehicle treatment. In D2.<i>mdx</i> mice, GLPG1972 improved forelimb grip strength and wire hang time compared with vehicle. Furthermore, GLPG1972 increased the strength of fast tibialis anterior muscles in situ and slow soleus muscles ex vivo, and this was associated with decreased inflammation, sarcolemma damage, and fibronectin deposition as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Together, these findings position ADAMTS-5 inhibition with GLPG1972 for further study as a disease-modifying strategy for DMD that may achieve both anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on muscle, resulting in improved contractile function."

However, in some boys, the disease manifests earlier in childhood with developmental delays, such as delays in walking and speech, or signs of an autism spectrum disorder.ObjectiveTo analyze and compare the age and time until diagnosis in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with or without developmental delays as the first sign of disease.Material and MethodsThis is a retrospective descriptive study. Data were collected from 127 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were followed at the Outpatient Muscle Clinic of Hospital das Clínicas (FMUSP/SP) from 2015 to 2024. To determine the age and time interval between symptom onset and diagnosis, we analyzed the total sample, and 3 separate groups based on initial symptoms.ResultsIn the total sample, the mean age of diagnosis was 6.9 years, with an average interval of 3.6 years between symptom onset and diagnosis. In patients with developmental delays, initial symptoms were observed at an average age of 1.4 years, and despite a diagnosis delay of 3.4 years, these patients were diagnosed an average of 2.7 years earlier than those with normal development.ConclusionOur findings suggest that Duchenne muscular dystrophy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of boys presenting with developmental delays (motor, speech, or cognitive). In such cases, screening with creatine kinase level measurements is crucial."

Intelligence quotients and site of mutations were also noted. 103/264 individuals (39%) had symptoms compatible with one of the following diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n=26), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n=11), depressive mood/disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (n=27), anxiety disorder (n=17), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n=2), psychosis risk syndrome (n=7), and 13 had a more complex phenotype. ADHD and ASD were more frequent in infancy, emotional dysregulation during early adolescence, and psychosis and more severe phobias in older boys and adults. The risk of developing these disorders did not increase with the concomitant involvement of the dystrophin isoforms Dp140 and Dp71. Pharmacological treatment was suggested for 48 individuals but was started only in 24, as it was refused by the remaining 24 families. Our findings confirm that neurodevelopmental and mental disorders are common in DMD and are likely to have a multifactorial nature. These findings support the need for disease-specific assessments and the need to increase awareness of the possible behavioural and social difficulties among families and healthcare professionals."

    "title": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction screening in muscular dystrophies using deep learning-based electrocardiogram interpretation.",
    "abstract": "Routine echocardiographic monitoring is recommended in muscular dystrophy patients to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) but is often challenging due to physical limitations. This study evaluates whether artificial intelligence-based electrocardiogram interpretation (AI-ECG) can detect and predict LVSD in muscular dystrophy patients. Patients aged >16 years who underwent an ECG and echocardiogram within 90 days at the University Medical Center Utrecht were included. Patients with Duchenne (DMD), Becker (BMD), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). myotonic dystrophy (MD), and female DMD/BMD carriers, were identified. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on a derivation cohort of patients without muscular dystrophy to detect LVSD and tested on muscular dystrophy patients. A Cox proportional hazards model assessed AI-ECG's predictive value for new-onset LVSD. The derivation cohort included 53,874 ECG-echocardiogram pairs from 30,978 patients, while the muscular dystrophy test set comprised 390 ECG-echo pairs from 390 patients. LVSD prevalence varied from 81.3 % in DMD to 13.4 % in MD. The model achieved an AUROC of 0.83 (0.79-0.87) in the muscular dystrophy test set, with sensitivity 0.87 (0.81-0.93), specificity 0.58 (0.52-0.63), NPV 0.91 (0.86-0.95), and PPV 0.49 (0.43-0.56). AI-ECG predicted new-onset LVSD with an AUROC of 0.72 (0.66-0.78), with AI-ECG probability being a significant predictor. AI-ECG can detect LVSD in muscular dystrophy patients, offering a non-invasive, accessible tool for risk stratification and an alternative to routine echocardiography. It may also predict new-onset LVSD, enabling earlier intervention. Further research should explore external validation, pediatric application, and integration within the clinical care plan."

The authors have summarized recent advances in gene therapy, its background, molecular basis (e.g. viral and non-viral vectors), gene-editing techniques (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN, ZFN), and its foremost applications in severe disorders, such as cancer, monogenic disorders (e.g. spinal muscular atrophy), polygenic disorders (e.g. autism), neurogenic disorders (e.g. Parkinson disease and Alzheimer's disease), and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV). In addition, we explored the major challenges faced by gene therapies during targeted delivery, immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety. To date, most of the promising approaches, such as different vectors, target cell populations, and both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> have paved the foundation for applications of gene therapies. Additionally, advances in enhancing the immune system that would certainly lower the healthcare costs.

    "abstract": "Although current treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have proven to be effective in delaying myopathy, there remains a strong need to identify novel targets to develop additional therapies. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early pathological feature of DMD. A fine balance of mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) is crucial to maintain mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle health. Excessive activation of Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission was reported in animal models of DMD. However, whether Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is a viable target for treating myopathy in DMD remains unknown. Here, we treated a D2-mdx model of DMD (9-10 weeks old) with Mdivi-1, a selective Drp1 inhibitor, every other day (i.p. injection) for 5 weeks. We demonstrated that Mdivi-1 effectively improved skeletal muscle strength and reduced serum creatine kinase concentration. Mdivi-1 treatment also effectively inhibited mitochondrial fission regulatory protein markers, Drp1(Ser616) phosphorylation and Fis1 in skeletal muscles from D2-mdx mice, which resulted in reduced content of damaged and fragmented mitochondria. Furthermore, Mdivi-1 treatment attenuated lipid peroxidation product, 4-HNE, in skeletal muscle from D2-mdx mice, which was inversely correlated with muscle grip strength. Finally, we revealed that Mdivi-1 treatment downregulated expression of markers of fibrosis (Col1a1, MMP2 and MMP9) and inflammation (IL-6, MCP1, and CXCL12). In summary, these results demonstrate that inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 is effective in improving muscle strength and alleviating muscle damage in D2-mdx mice. These improvements are associated with improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial integrity, leading to attenuated lipid peroxidation."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked, recessive disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin, a membrane-associated protein necessary for maintaining muscle structure and function. One of the common DMD mutations is the deletion of exon 52 (Δ52), which introduces a premature stop codon in exon 53, preventing the expression of functional dystrophin protein. Patients with this mutation could benefit from skipping or reframing exon 53 to restore the dystrophin open reading frame. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of single-cut CRISPR gene editing with <i>Staphylococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9 (<i>Sp</i>Cas9)-LRVQR to restore dystrophin expression in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and a newly generated humanized DMD mouse model. We compared two injection routes for adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9 to deliver gene-editing components to neonatal mice: intraperitoneal (IP) and facial vein (FV) injection. We observed efficient restoration of dystrophin protein expression across multiple skeletal muscle groups and the heart. The AAV9-mediated CRISPR single-cut approach ameliorated key DMD hallmarks, including histopathological phenotypes, impaired grip strength, and elevated serum creatine kinase levels. Our optimized strategies for dystrophin restoration in humanized DMD mice with exon 52 deletion represent a promising treatment for DMD."

    "title": "Household costs in the United States for accommodating functional impairments associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: results from a caregiver survey.",
    "abstract": "Individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) often require mobility aids and accessible homes and vehicles. Because these accommodations are not typically reimbursed by insurance, costs largely fall upon patients' families. Additionally, families often incur high out-of-pocket costs for DMD-related health services and treatments. Research describing these expenses is important to understand the full financial cost associated with DMD. The objective of this study was to quantify household costs associated with DMD-related accommodations. A cross-sectional, retrospective online survey was conducted among United States-based family caregivers who provided informal (unpaid) care to ≥ 1 household member with DMD for ≥ 12 months and paid for ≥ 1 home/vehicle-related expense in the past 5 years. Participants reported costs, external financial support, and affordability for (1) home/vehicle purchases/modifications, (2) non-reimbursed medical equipment, (3) non-reimbursed health services or drugs, and (4) other household expenses. Costs were averaged over all respondents and among those incurring costs (conditional means). Average costs were stratified by ambulatory status, upper-limb impairment, insurance coverage type, home ownership status, and annual combined household income. Among 90 caregivers, 94.4% were female, 90.0% were White, and 82.1% were the primary caregiver. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of individuals with DMD (n = 106) was 14.5 (5.3) years. Over half (59.4%) were reported as non-ambulatory, 23.6% as ambulatory, and 17.0% as transitioning from ambulatory to non-ambulatory. Average (SD) household costs over the past 5 years were $78,303 ($78,411) for home/vehicle expenses and $14,071 ($27,427) for medical equipment. Major home/vehicle expenses included purchasing/modifying a handicap-accessible vehicle (64% in past 5 years; conditional mean 5-year cost: $47,997), modifying home entrances (61%; $16,750), and modifying bathrooms (46%; $13,512). Powered wheelchairs were the leading driver of medical equipment costs (43%; $15,718). Annual recurring, non-reimbursed health service and drug costs were $13,642 (SD $41,792). Other recurring annual household expenses were $2593 (SD $4144). Household costs generally increased with more advanced disease progression. Households were able to pay for some expenses using external funding from the US government (e.g., Medicaid waivers) and non-government resources (e.g., charitable foundations, independently raised funds). However, many caregivers reported having to forgo purchases due to prohibitive costs. Households incur substantial costs to accommodate the functional impairments experienced by individuals with DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal dystrophy characterized by the progressive loss of muscle fibers caused by mutations in DMD gene and absence of the dystrophin protein. Although autophagy and lysosome biogenesis defects have been described in DMD muscles, the endosomal pathway has never been studied. Here, it was shown that impaired lysosome formation is associated with altered acidification and reduced degradative function of the endolysosomal pathway in muscle cells derived from patients with DMD. The data demonstrated that early endosomes are increased in these cells as well as in muscle biopsies from patients with DMD and two animal models of DMD, mdx mice and golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs. It was determined that these abnormalities are due to the lack of dystrophin per se and could be correlated with disease progression and severity. We further identified an abnormal up-regulation of the Rab5 GTPase protein, one key actor of early endosomal biogenesis and fusion, in the three DMD models, which may underlie the endosomal defects. Finally, we demonstrated that Rab5 knockdown in human DMD muscle cells as well as dystrophin restoration in golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs normalize Rab5 expression levels and rescue endosomal abnormalities. This study unveils a defect in a pathway essential for muscle homeostasis and for the efficacy of DMD therapies."

Despite advances in genetic diagnostics, data from Southeast Asia remain limited. Ancestral variation may influence mutation spectra, revealing novel alleles and phenotypic diversity. We evaluated the diagnostic yield and clinical impact of targeted gene panel testing and exome sequencing in pediatric-onset NMDs at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand (2020‒2024). Patients with suspected genetic NMDs and negative single-gene tests underwent gene panel testing or exome sequencing. Genetic findings were classified as positive, probable, possible, or negative. Among 135 patients, the overall diagnostic yield was 69.6% (94/135). Subgroup yields were 70.7% for inherited myopathies (53/75), 63.3% for inherited neuropathies (31/49), 90.0% for congenital myasthenic syndromes (9/10), and 100% for motor neuron diseases (1/1). Excluding patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the diagnostic yield of inherited myopathies was 63.2% (36/57). Genetic diagnoses influenced clinical care in 87.2% of cases, prompting revised diagnoses, personalized treatments, enhanced surveillance, informed family planning, and accurate prognostication. NGS substantially enhances diagnostic accuracy and clinical management for pediatric NMDs. These findings support incorporating NGS into diagnostic workflows for suspected genetic NMDs, thereby optimizing patient care and advancing genetic insights. Gene panel testing and exome sequencing demonstrate an approximately 70% diagnostic yield for pediatric neuromuscular disorders, exceeding yields reported in many other hereditary diseases. Genetic findings underscore potential differences in mutation spectra among Southeast Asian populations, which remain under-investigated relative to Western cohorts. Clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing confers substantial benefits, including more accurate diagnoses, personalized management, and informed family planning, ultimately improving care for pediatric neuromuscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Gene replacement therapies mediated by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors represent a promising approach for treating genetic diseases. However, their modest packaging capacity (~4.7 kb) remains an important constraint and significantly limits their application for genetic disorders involving large genes. A prominent example is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), whose protein product dystrophin is generated from an 11.2 kb segment of the DMD mRNA. Here, we explored methods that enable efficient expression of full-length dystrophin via triple AAV co-delivery. This method exploits the protein trans-splicing mechanism mediated by split inteins. We identified a combination of efficient and specific split intein pairs that enables the reconstitution of full-length dystrophin from three dystrophin fragments. We show that systemic delivery of low doses of the myotropic AAVMYO1 in mdx4cv mice leads to efficient expression of full-length dystrophin in the hindlimb, diaphragm, and heart muscles. Notably, muscle morphology and physiology were significantly improved in triple AAV-treated mdx4cv mice versus saline-treated controls. This method shows the feasibility of expressing large proteins from several fragments that are delivered using low doses of myotropic AAV vectors. It can be adapted to other large genes involved in disorders for which gene replacement remains challenged by the modest AAV cargo capacity."

This study evaluated the psychometric properties and measurement quality of the PROMIS PP UE item bank v1.0 (29 items) in DMD using a Rasch psychometric analysis. The PROMIS PP UE item bank was completed by caregivers of children with DMD aged at least 8 years, under care at Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, OH, United States). Rasch analysis was used to evaluate the psychometric performance of the measure and its items in DMD, based on several criteria, including item-trait interaction, individual items fit, Person Separation Index (PSI), individual persons fit, and response dependency. Rasch analysis was conducted on 206 observations. Several items had weak clinical utility in measuring upper extremity functioning in DMD. Additionally, the analysis identified specific response options that could be restructured to improve the reliability and precision of the items in evaluating upper extremity function in DMD. A new customized 21-item measure demonstrated overall good fit to Rasch model expectations (<i>p</i> = 0.095; nonsignificant) and the ability to discriminate among respondents with different levels of upper extremity function (0.95 PSI; excellent reliability). Upper extremity function was generally well targeted across the severity spectrum, except for the least severe patients. The customized PROMIS PP UE measure conformed to Rasch assumptions, indicating that it can serve as a reliable option for caregiver-reported upper extremity assessment in DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mainly affects young boys with out-of-frame mutations in the DMD gene, leading to dystrophin deficiency. This loss disrupts the assembly of the sarcolemmal dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, resulting in membrane fragility and damage during muscle contraction-relaxation cycles. Consequently, patients experience progressive muscle weakness, loss of ambulation and cardiorespiratory failure. Gene therapy represents one of the most promising therapeutic approaches, requiring rigorous preclinical validation of candidate strategies. While several preclinical models of dystrophin deficiency mimic point mutations or exon deletions, no existing rat model accurately replicates DMD gene duplications, which account for approximately 10% of DMD cases. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated a ~ 125 kbp duplication encompassing exons 10-17 of the Dmd gene in Sprague Dawley rats. To characterise disease progression in these rats, we assessed biochemical, histological and functional biomarkers at 6 and 10 months of age, comparing them to their healthy littermates. We established the R-DMDdup10-17 line. The microstructure of limb, diaphragm and cardiac muscles of R-DMDdup10-17 (DMD) rats exhibited dystrophic changes at 6 and 10 months, including loss of myofibres and fibrosis. These alterations led to a significant body mass reduction, muscle weakness (including diaphragm deficiency) and cardiac electrical defects. Premature lethality was observed between 10 and 13 months. Duplication of the Dmd genomic region encompassing exons 10 to 17 in rats results in dystrophin deficiency, severe striated muscle dystrophy, and premature death. The R-DMDdup10-17 line represents the first reported genetic model of a severe and early lethal duplication variant in the Dmd gene. It provides a critical tool for assessing targeted gene therapies aimed to correct such mutations."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a serious, progressive neuromuscular condition that predominantly impacts male individuals, marked by progressive muscle weakness resulting from mutations in the dystrophin gene (DMD) encoding dystrophin. DMD is a primary muscle disorder that often presents with secondary abnormalities in lipid metabolism and decreased bone mineral density. Although disturbances in circulating lipid profiles and skeletal health have been observed in individuals with DMD, their relationship remains underexplored.This study aimed to investigate the potential association between lipid metabolic disturbances and spinal bone mineral density in patients with DMD by combining clinical lipid levels and bone density with transcriptomic pathway analysis of DMD muscle tissue. Retrospective analysis was performed on 219 genetically confirmed DMD patients and 99 age-matched healthy controls. Healthy controls with a family history of genetic disorders were excluded. Clinical data included lipid profiles (triglycerides [TGs], remnant cholesterol [RC]); bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was evaluated using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); and corticosteroid use, including treatment status, dose, and duration. Patients were stratified by corticosteroid exposure. Restricted cubic splines and multivariable regression models were applied to explore potential relationships between lipid parameters and bone mineral density. Bioinformatic analyses were performed on RNA sequencing data from muscle biopsy samples from patients with DMD (GSE38417 dataset) and an independent validation cohort (GSE6011 dataset), focusing on pathways related to lipid metabolism and osteoclast differentiation. Patients with DMD had higher TG, RC, and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels than healthy controls (P < 0.05). Elevated TG and RC levels were associated with reduced spine bone mineral density, independent of corticosteroid use. The bioinformatic analyses identified key pathways, including sphingolipid metabolism and osteoclast differentiation, as well as hub genes such as FCGR2B, C1QA, which are involved in lipid regulation and bone remodeling. Lipid abnormalities, particularly elevated TG and RC levels, were significantly associated with lower bone mineral density in patients with DMD. These findings suggest that lipid abnormalities are involved in bone health impairment in DMD, warranting further studies to confirm the association."

The extent to which these relationships develop across all 4 cardiac chambers, particularly during early-stage disease, remains unknown. We discovered that very young D2.mdx mice exhibit fibrosis exclusively in the right ventricle (RV) and left atrium. Concurrent myocardial disorganization in the RV was related to a highly specific inflammatory signature of increased infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup>), myofibre mitochondrial-linked apoptosis, and reduced carbohydrate and fat oxidation. This relationship did not occur in the left ventricle. Short-term daily administration of a peptidomimetic adiponectin receptor agonist, ALY688, prevented RV fibrosis, infiltrating macrophages, and mitochondrial stress as well as left atrial fibrosis. Our discoveries demonstrate early-stage cardiac tissue pathology occurs in a chamber-specific manner and is prevented by adiponectin receptor agonism, thereby opening a new direction for developing therapies that prevent tissue remodeling during DMD."

Obesity, a common feature of DMD, exacerbates this inflammation. Although corticosteroids are the conventional treatment, their adverse effects are substantial. The use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAω-3) as adjuvant therapy is under investigation. A comprehensive review of studies from 2011 to May 2024 reveals that supplementation with PUFAω-3 has beneficial effects in mdx mice, a model of DMD. These include reduction of the inflammatory process in both muscle and circulation, in addition to decreased myonecrosis, resulting in improved muscle strength and endurance. Supplementation also had a positive impact on cardiac tissue, reducing fibrosis and inflammation present in this tissue. These results were corroborated in patients with DMD. A significant decrease in inflammatory markers such as NF-kB, IL-1β and IL-6 was observed with PUFAω-3, and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect. These findings support the use of PUFAω-3 as adjuvant therapy in DMD, although further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and clinical benefits."

    "abstract": "Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a rare and heterogeneous form of dystrophinopathy caused by expression of altered dystrophin proteins, as a consequence of in-frame genetic mutations. The majority of the BMD biomarker studies employ targeted approaches and focus on translating findings from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a more severe disease form with clinical similarities but caused by out-of-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene. Importantly, DMD therapies assume that disease progression can be slowed by promoting the expression of truncated dystrophin comparable to what occurs in BMD patients. In this study, we explore similarities and differences in protein trajectories over time between BMD and DMD serum, and explore proteins related to motor function performance. Serum samples collected from 34 BMD patients, in a prospective longitudinal 3-year study, and 19 DMD patients, were analyzed by using Data Independent Acquisition Tandem Mass Spectrometry (DIA-MS). Subsequent normalization, linear mixed effects model was employed to identify proteins associated with physical tests and dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. Analysis was also performed to explore the discrepancy between DMD and BMD biomarker abundance trajectories over time. Linear mixed effects models identified 20 proteins with altered longitudinal signatures between DMD and BMD, including creatine kinase M-type (CKM) pyruvate kinase (PKM), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M). Furthermore, several proteins related to innate immune response were associated with motor function in BMD patients. In particular, A2M displayed an altered time-dependent decline in relation to dystrophin expression in the tibialis anterior muscle. Our study revealed differences in the serum proteome between BMD and DMD, which comprises proteins involved in the immune response, extracellular matrix organization and hemostasis but not muscle leakage proteins significantly associated with disease progression in DMD. If further evaluated and validated, these biomarker candidates may offer means to monitor disease progression in BMD patients. A2M is of particular interest due to its association with dystrophin expression in BMD muscle and higher abundance in DMD patients in comparison to BMD. If validated, A2M could be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in therapeutic clinical trials aiming to restore dystrophin expression."

Twenty-three percent of patients were non-ambulant at last evaluation, with a mean age at loss of ambulation (LoA) of 42.2 years (range 11.2-77.6 years). Disease duration correlated with the severity of motor impairment (expressed as fully ambulant, ambulant with limitation, ambulant with aids, non-ambulant) at last assessment. Cardiac involvement was observed in 52.3% of patients. Severe respiratory impairment was rare and more prevalent in non-ambulant patients. Neuropsychiatric issues were common (44.2%), but only 18.4% of patients had a formal diagnosis. Retrospective analyses of clinical case records contribute to improved understanding of the variability of phenotypes of BMD. Combined with data from other large cohorts, these findings can contribute to the development of standard of care guidelines for BMD and inform the design of clinical trials of novel therapies."

    "abstract": "The study aims to investigate the effects of the MI (Motor Imagery) program applied in addition to the PTR (Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation) program on gait and balance in children with DMD (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy). The 38 boys with DMD were included in the study and randomized into two groups: the PTR group (mean age: 7.96 ± 1.94 years) and the MI + PTR group (mean age: 9.03 ± 1.71 years). In the PTR group, the PTR program was administered 2 days/week for 8 weeks, and in the MI + PTR group, the MI program was administered 5 days/week in addition to the PTR program. Groups were assessed by the Brooke Lower Extremity Functional Classification Scale, Modified Pediatric Mini Mental Scale, Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ-c), Kinovea® Software Program, Timed Up & Go Test (TUG), Timed Function Tests (TFT), Two-Minute Walk Test (2MWT), and Motor Function Measure (MFM-32). As a result of the study, in PTR Group, TFT-Stairs descending (p = 0.049) was improved. In MI + PTR Group, Kinovea® Software Program-Walking Speed (p = 0.003), 2MWT (p = 0.037), TFT-Stair descend and 10-m walk (respectively; p = 0.001; p = 0.039), and MFM-32-D1 (p = 0.036) were improved. According to the comparison between groups, the groups were not superior to each other (p > 0.05). Although the MI program applied in addition to the PTR program contributes to improvements in walking speed, walking distance, and functional performance in children with DMD, it does not demonstrate superiority over the PTR program alone."

    "abstract": "Pathological events often impact tissue regions in a spatially variable manner, making it challenging to identify therapeutic targets. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a powerful technology to map spatially variable molecular mechanisms, yet suitable analytical methods have been lacking. We introduce spatially resolved pathology score (SPaSE), an optimal transport-based algorithm to compare ST data from diseased and control tissues. SPaSE computes a \"pathology score\" for each spot in the diseased sample, quantifying the pathological impact at that spot. In post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) mouse hearts, these scores delineated zones that matched independent expert annotations. Modeling pathology scores from gene expression revealed signatures predictive of varying pathological severity. The scoring model learned from mouse data showed accurate predictions on human post-MI data. We also demonstrated SPaSE's efficacy on additional simulated and real ST data from traumatic brain injury and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. SPaSE is a useful addition to the existing ST algorithms. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information."

Altered expression of enzymes that generate hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has been demonstrated in dystrophic muscles, however, the exact role of this gasotransmitter in DMD remains elusive. Here, we investigated the effect of the slow-releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donor (GYY4137) on the skeletal muscles of the dystrophin-deficient <i>mdx</i> mice. <b><i>Methods and Results:</i></b> Grip strength assay and the treadmill exhaustion test showed that administering the GYY4137 donor to <i>mdx</i> mice improved DMD-related decline in motor functions. Additionally, the H<sub>2</sub>S donor decreased the level of muscle damage markers such as lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and osteopontin (OPN). Histological, gene, and protein analyses of the dystrophic gastrocnemius and diaphragm muscles revealed reduced inflammation and fibrosis after treatment with the H<sub>2</sub>S donor. Moreover, we showed decreased necrosis with improved muscle regeneration and angiogenesis. We demonstrated that GYY4137 upregulates the levels of phosphorylated AMPKα, as well as the cytoprotective and antioxidant heme oxygenase-1, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (<i>Gclm</i>). Finally, it exerted an anti-apoptotic effect by reducing cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-3 and increasing AKT phosphorylation. <b><i>Innovation and Conclusion:</i></b> The administration of GYY4137 improves exercise capacity and ameliorates the markers of inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and necrosis in the skeletal muscles of <i>mdx</i> animals pointing out its possible therapeutic use in DMD pathology. <i>Antioxid.

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration in chronic muscle diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) has remained clinically unsurmountable. Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) plays a critical role in adult skeletal muscle metabolism and exercise fitness. Whether ERRα activation can drive muscle regeneration and mitigation of dystrophy in DMD is not known. We have investigated ERRα signaling in pre-clinical models of acute muscle injury and DMD. ERRα is induced in differentiating C2C12 myoblast and regenerating muscle. ERRα silencing suppressed proliferation and differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts. RNA sequencing revealed that angiogenic factor and proliferation genes were downregulated by ERRα knockdown in proliferating cells, whereas oxidative mitochondrial and differentiation regulator genes were downregulated in differentiating cells. In accordance with in vitro findings, transgenic ERRα overexpression in rodent skeletal muscle stimulates muscle regeneration after acute BaCl <sub>2</sub> injury, which is accompanied by enhanced angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Notably, ERRα and its angiogenic and metabolic target gene expression is suppressed in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) derived from dystrophic muscles in mdx mice, coinciding with proliferation and differentiation defect in these cells. Loss of ERRα and its target gene expression was recapitulated in adult dystrophic mdx muscles. Consequently, muscle specific ERRα overexpression in mdx mice restored angiogenic and metabolic gene expression, induced vascular and oxidative remodeling, alleviated baseline muscle damage, and boosted regeneration after BaCl2 injury in dystrophic muscle. Our studies demonstrate a pro-regenerative role of ERRα and its deficiency in dystrophic muscles and its MuSCs. ERRα restoration could be a therapeutic strategy for DMD through angio-metabolic gene program."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle wasting disease for which there is no cure. There is a critical need for additional therapeutics. Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified candidate DMD genetic modifiers that could serve as therapeutic targets. Because many GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie in noncoding, putative regulatory regions, it can be challenging to identify which gene(s) are regulated by these SNPs and how gene expression is altered to modify disease severity even with extensive in silico modeling. We analyzed expression of zebrafish orthologs of putative DMD modifiers and showed almost all are comparably expressed in wild-type and dmd mutant zebrafish at three different stages of disease. To model decreased expression of candidate modifiers, we pursued a zebrafish CRISPR-based screening approach, which we validated by testing zebrafish orthologs of two extensively studied DMD modifiers, LTBP4 and THBS1. We then tested candidates from the most recent GWAS and demonstrate that galntl6, man1a1, etaa1a;etaa1b, and adamts17 are bona fide DMD modifiers. Our findings demonstrate the utility of zebrafish for DMD genetic modifier screening and characterizing modifier function."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive genetic disease that leads to degeneration of muscles, including respiratory muscles, and requires early introduction of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Parental knowledge and management strategies for pulmonary care are essential when respiratory function is compromised, particularly in conditions involving sleep apnea and the progression of chronic respiratory failure. The aim of this study was to assess parental knowledge of key aspects of pulmonary care in DMD and to identify knowledge gaps that may influence therapeutic decisions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted as part of the multidisciplinary care program for DMD at the Center for Rare Diseases in Gdańsk, accredited by the World Duchenne Organization. The questionnaire assessed (1) demographic and clinical details, (2) pulmonary healthcare practices, (3) understanding of pulmonary rehabilitation, (4) knowledge about NIV, and (5) sources of information on respiratory care. The study included 111 parents (F/M 83/28, mean age 45.5 ± 6.75 years) of 111 children with DMD (all male, mean age 11.5 ± 5.45 years; 38% non-ambulatory). The majority of individuals (77.5%) regularly visited a pulmonary specialist with spirometry performed. Most parents reported satisfactory knowledge about respiratory issues in DMD but 77% of them reported insufficient knowledge about NIV (Chi<sup>2</sup> = 53.4, df = 12, p = 0.00). Only 11% weren't afraid to use NIV in the future, while 73% were afraid because of a lack of or inaccurate information. Physicians were the primary source of knowledge for pulmonary care, while the internet and peer experiences were rarely used. The majority of parents of children with DMD understand the basics of pulmonary problems. A significant information gap exists concerning advanced respiratory interventions such as non-invasive ventilation (NIV). This leads to anxiety among parents and impairs therapeutic decision-making, delaying appropriate treatment including respiratory support. There is a need for respiratory education programmes for parents and patients, especially as the estimated longer survival time for patients with DMD will make respiratory challenges even more significant."

Increasing evidence supports the contributing role of satellite cells in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal degenerative muscle disease caused by loss of dystrophin. However, whether or not satellite cells exhibit dysfunction due to loss of dystrophin remains unresolved. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to determine how dystrophin deficiency impacts the satellite cell transcriptome and cellular composition by comparing satellite cells from mdx and the more severe D2-mdx DMD mouse models. DMD satellite cells were disproportionally found within myogenic progenitor clusters and a previously uncharacterized DMD-enriched cluster. Despite exposure to different dystrophic environments, mdx and D2-mdx satellite cells exhibited overlapping dysregulation in gene expression and associated biological pathways. When comparing satellite stem cell versus myogenic progenitor populations, we identified unique dysfunctions between DMD and healthy satellite cells, including apoptotic cell death and senescence, respectively. Pseudotime analyses revealed differences in cell fate trajectories, indicating that DMD satellite cells are stalled in their differentiation capacity. In vivo regeneration assays confirmed that DMD satellite cells exhibit impaired myogenic gene expression and cell fate dynamics during regenerative myogenesis. These defects in differentiation capacity are accompanied by impaired senescence and autophagy dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that inducing autophagy can rescue the differentiation of DMD progenitors. Our findings provide novel molecular evidence of satellite cell dysfunction in DMD, expanding on our understanding of their role in its pathology and suggesting pathways to target and enhance their regenerative capacity."

Multidisciplinary care and new therapies have prolonged quantity and quality of life, for which many families remain dependent on Medicaid for access to standards of care. Proposed Medicaid funding cuts would disproportionately harm children with complex medical conditions, including DMD, jeopardizing their access to essential services and specialized care. Children with DMD rely on comprehensive multidisciplinary care, including neurology, cardiology, pulmonology, endocrinology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation specialists. Medicaid enables access to life-extending therapies, including (but not limited to) cardiac monitoring, ventilatory support, multidisciplinary steroid complications management, and mobility and accessibility devices to promote independence and dignity. Even families with private insurance often rely on Medicaid to bridge coverage gaps. Cutting Medicaid would force untenable decisions: families may have to forgo critical medications, critical heart scans, or essential mobility equipment. These choices would have devastating real-world consequences, resulting in loss of function, accelerated disease progression, and earlier deaths. Not applicable. Not applicable. As neuromuscular specialists at the UMass Duchenne Program, we see firsthand that Medicaid is not a luxury; it is the foundation that gives families hope for a better future. Children with DMD, as a protected and vulnerable population, cannot advocate for themselves. We must be their voice. Medicaid cuts are not merely a fiscal decision; they are a moral decision with life-altering consequences. We urge policymakers to protect Medicaid and safeguard the future of children living with DMD."

    "abstract": "Myogenic regulatory factors, including myoblast determination protein 1 (MyoD1 or MyoD) and myogenic factor 5 (Myf5), crucially regulate skeletal muscle lineage specification and development. Although MyoD and Myf5 exhibit overlapping functions during embryogenesis, their roles significantly diverge in adult muscles. Single <i>MyoD</i> knockout analysis revealed that MyoD uniquely regulates adult muscle regeneration, considerably influencing delayed myogenic differentiation, enhancing self-renewal, and modulating apoptosis resistance. These findings highlight fundamental differences between embryonic and adult myogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revealed the heterogeneity of MyoD expression among adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs), thereby elucidating its diverse functional roles during muscle regeneration. Furthermore, MyoD has been implicated in the regulation of myofiber type specification and plasticity in mature skeletal muscles. Overall, these findings suggest that MyoD serves as a key orchestrator in cellular, functional, and pathological processes in adult skeletal muscle across multiple contexts. Although previous reviews have extensively addressed the role of MyoD in embryonic muscle development, the available literature lacks a focused discussion on its multifaceted functions in adult MuSCs, mature myofibers, and the aging process. In this review, we aimed to bridge this gap by integrating recent discoveries and offering novel insights into the dynamic roles of MyoD in adult skeletal muscles; the information discussed in this review has potential therapeutic implications in muscle regeneration, disease management, and combating age-related muscle decline."

This retrospective cohort study collated information on clinical management and disease milestones from medical records of males with DMD attending a paediatric hospital between 1973 and 2019 and linked this to information from two adult tertiary hospitals. Data were stratified by decade of birth and Kaplan Meier analyses were conducted to describe median time to key disease milestones. The cohort included 356 individuals with DMD with year of birth ranging from 1958 to 2014 and median (interquartile range, IQR) follow up time from diagnosis of 10.5 (4.1, 15.7) years. Use of corticosteroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), echocardiography and respiratory support increased over time. Mean age of diagnosis decreased from 6.4 years in those born before 1970 to 3.4 years in those born 2010-2019. Median (IQR) survival increased over time from 18.2 (15.2, 20.4) years in those born before 1970 to 24.0 (20.3, 27.5) years in those born between 1990 and 1999. Increased life expectancy was observed in individuals using corticosteroids, ACE-I and respiratory support. Survival in individuals with DMD has increased over the last five decades, likely due to changes in clinical management. Given the increased population surviving to adulthood, there is a need to enhance clinical services and surveillance to support neuromuscular disease in Australia, especially in transitional care and adult populations.

    "abstract": "Presynaptic terminals of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are sensitive to glutamate, which contributes to NMJ plasticity and synaptic neurotransmission. However, the effect of glutamate on neurotransmission and its pharmacologic modulation in muscle pathologies are understudied. In this study, the efficacy of pharmacologic blockade of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD)-1 in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, was investigated. The GLUD1 inhibitor R162 mitigated the malfunctioning of NMJs by enhancing glutamate release from muscle fibers and increasing its availability in the muscle interstitium. Glutamate binding to its N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor on the presynaptic bottom of NMJs resulted in the increased release of acetylcholine and functional recovery of the action potential and muscle contraction, ultimately improving muscle performance. Finally, the GLUD1 inhibitor did not affect the homeostatic control of NMJs and the behavior of either healthy or dystrophic mice. This study suggests a promising and feasible therapeutic approach, based on muscle glutamate exploitation, to treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an unmet need in the clinic so far."

Affected individuals present predominantly with proximal lower limb weakness and pseudohypertrophy of calf musculature being a prominent sign, heralding the onset of contractures in the large joints of lower limbs. Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome (KDSS) refers to the muscular pseudohypertrophy that develops in children with long-standing hypothyroidism. We present an 11-year-old boy with progressive walking difficulty for two years and associated decrease in appetite and chronic constipation. Physical examination revealed mild soft goitre, proximal lower limb weakness, areflexia (except for preserved weak ankle reflex), soft hypertrophy of bilateral calf muscles and latissimus dorsi, with bilateral dynamic ankle joint contractures. Investigations showed moderately elevated total serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), low free T4, normal free T3 and elevated serum anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibody titers. A diagnosis of hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome (KDSS) (thyroid myopathy) was made while multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification confirmed DMD. He was started on steroids and levothyroxine. On follow up, he had improvement in activity, appetite and motor movements (North Star Ambulatory Assessment score 3 to 7). As a very rare coincidence, our patient suffered from two different diseases with similar presentation which are DMD and KDSS. Subtle clinical clues of joint contractures and goitre helped us identify these unrelated co-existing diseases.

Simulating the inheritance patterns of DMD by mating <i>mdx</i>-heterozygous females with wildtype males, we compare the central, autonomic, and peripheral phenotypes of healthy and DMD-affected (<i>mdx</i>) male offspring born from mothers that were either stressed or non-stressed during gestation. Prenatal stress predisposed <i>mdx</i> offspring to anxiety-like behavior and reduced bone mass but did not exacerbate stress hypersensitivity or skeletal muscle mass and function.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive genetic disorder primarily affecting boys, characterized by muscle degeneration due to mutations in the DMD gene encoding dystrophin, a crucial protein for muscle fiber integrity. The disease leads to significant muscle weakness and eventually to loss of ambulation. Adeno-associated viral (AAV)-microdystrophin (MD) gene therapy shows promise in preclinical and clinical settings. However, muscle fibrosis, a consequence of chronic inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling, exacerbates disease progression and may hinder therapeutic efficacy. Periostin, a matricellular protein involved in fibrosis, is upregulated in DMD rodent models and correlates with collagen deposition. We previously developed an antisense oligonucleotide strategy to induce exon 17 skipping and so reduce periostin expression and collagen accumulation in the fibrotic D2.<i>mdx</i> mouse model of DMD. Here, we investigated the combined effects of periostin modulation and AAV-MD1 treatment. We found that systemic periostin splicing modulation significantly improved muscle function, assessed by forelimb grip strength and treadmill performance. Importantly, periostin exon skipping increased the MD protein expression. These findings suggest that targeting periostin in conjunction with MD therapy could represent a valid therapeutic strategy for DMD."

This review highlights the increasing recognition of testosterone and androgen signaling in various neurological conditions, with evidence of both protective and harmful effects depending on dosage and context. Although limited to experimental use, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may serve potential benefits in the management of multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, headache, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease. On the other hand, androgen-blocking treatments may help alter disease progression in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Testosterone supplementation can have potential adverse events when used at a supratherapeutic level, and prenatal testosterone exposure is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease. Additionally, androgen-blocking agents could increase the risk of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Despite the above findings, there is no established indication of TRT or androgen-blocking medication in neurological disorders. The body of evidence highlighting the involvement of androgens and androgen receptors (ARs) in pathogenesis of neurological diseases is growing.

Initiating IV bisphosphonate therapy prior to first fracture may be a logical primary preventative approach given the extent and related morbidity of osteoporosis, although there is limited evidence for this. This qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and focus groups, aimed to explore the opinions and prospective acceptability of young people with DMD, parents and health professionals in the UK on initiating bisphosphonate therapy prior to first fracture. Four boys with DMD (aged 15-17 years) and 20 parents participated in semi-structured interviews. Twenty-seven health professionals involved in the care of young people with DMD participated in focus groups. A framework analysis was conducted. Three categories were identified which represented a continuum of opinions on the endorsement of preventative bisphosphonate therapy: 1) \"It buys them time\", endorsement of preventative bisphosphonate therapy; 2) Uncertainty and the importance of \"choice\"; and 3) \"Worry about... starting bisphosphonates even earlier\", not endorsing the use of preventative bisphosphonate therapy. Young people with DMD and parents discussed a range of opinions about the prospective acceptability of IV bisphosphonate as preventative therapy, highlighting the importance of family choice before initiation of therapy. Health professionals called for future research exploring the risks and benefits of preventative IV bisphosphonate therapy for young people with DMD to inform clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene manifesting in early childhood with progressive muscle weakness. First symptoms of muscle weakness usually appear around age of three, however, other signs of the disease like muscle hypertrophy, poor motor skills and social, language and motor delay can be detected earlier. Significant delays in the diagnostic process for DMD have been reported in many countries, with the diagnosis generally being made around five years. A collaborative historical cohort study was conducted to identify the age at diagnosis of DMD in five neuromuscular centers in Brazil, covering cases diagnosed between January 2019 and March 2024. In addition to data from the centers, data on age at diagnosis were obtained from The Brazilian National Network for Rare Diseases (RARAS). The final analytic cohort included 173 DMD individuals. The mean age at which patients were diagnosed with probable DMD based on clinical suspicion was 5.7 (±2.7) years, with diagnostic confirmation by genetic testing/muscle biopsy at 6.9 (±4.0) years, with medians of 6.0 and 6.8 years, respectively. The mean age at which parents noticed symptoms was 3.4 (±1.9) years with a median of 3.0 years. The most frequently observed initial symptoms by parents included frequent falls (35.5 %), gait abnormalities (31.4 %), difficulties in stair climbing (17.2 %), developmental delay (13.6 %), and difficulties in rising from the floor (8.9 %). The presence of co-occurring neurocognitive conditions was associated with a delay of 1.12 years (p = 0.008) in the median age at suspected diagnosis and 1.0 years in the median age at diagnosis confirmation (p = 0,022). These results suggest that while there have been improvements in the age of diagnosis of DMD in Brazil in recent decades, diagnosis still occurs later than ideal and then what has been achieved in high-income countries."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disorder arising from loss of the structural protein, dystrophin. It also often presents with cognitive deficits and susceptibility to epilepsy. Expressed in neurons of the hippocampus, dystrophin plays an important role in synapse formation, specifically the post-synaptic organisation of γ-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). This study explored possible interactions between interleukin (IL)-6, which is elevated in DMD, and GABA<sub>A</sub>R signalling in cultured hippocampal neurons of dystrophic mdx mice. Immunofluorescent imaging revealed altered development of network connectivity that displayed similar characteristics to dystrophin-expressing neurons cultured in elevated levels of IL-6. Mdx neurons dependably exhibited spontaneous oscillations. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signalling was further modulated by exposure to agonists and antagonists of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs. IL-6-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were enhanced by muscimol, a GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist, in wildtype (WT) and mdx neurons, whilst bicuculline, a GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist, only suppressed IL-6-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup>activity in WT neurons. The GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist, baclofen, enhanced IL-6-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses only in mdx neurons. Our findings support dysfunctional GABAergic signalling in hippocampal neurons that lack dystrophin, resulting in aberrant neuronal network excitability. The contribution of elevated levels of IL-6 further impact upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyshomeostasis in dystrophic neurons and may underpin cognitive changes reported in dystrophinopathies."

While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) remains the gold standard for such analyses, traditional manual segmentation methods are time-consuming and prone to error. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that combines probabilistic interactive segmentation with automated quantification of mitochondrial morphology. Leveraging uncertainty analysis and real-time user feedback, the model achieves comparable segmentation accuracy while reducing analysis time by 90% compared to manual methods. Evaluated on both benchmark Lucchi++ datasets and real-world TEM images of mouse skeletal muscle, the pipeline not only improved efficiency but also identified key pathological differences in mitochondrial morphology between wild-type and mdx mouse models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This automated approach offers a powerful, scalable tool for mitochondrial analysis, enabling high-throughput and reproducible insights into cellular function and disease mechanisms."

    "title": "Impact of Becker muscular dystrophy on gait patterns: Insights from biomechanical analysis.",
    "abstract": "Current research on muscular dystrophy primarily focuses on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with early onset. However, studies on gait characteristics in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) patients with later onset, particularly those diagnosed after the age of 16, remain limited. The late onset of symptoms may disrupt previously established gait patterns, potentially leading to unique compensatory mechanisms and clinical outcomes. This study aims to investigate gait characteristics and plantar pressure distribution in BMD patients with symptom onset after the age of 16. Seven male BMD patients diagnosed after the age of 16 and ten healthy male controls were recruited. Changes in gait kinematics and kinetics were analyzed using statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM), plantar pressure was measured, and symmetry angles (SA) were calculated. BMD patients exhibited greater anterior pelvic tilt and increased hip flexion during the stance phase (StP), along with higher peak hip extension moments in the early StP, knee hyperextension and insufficient knee extension moments in the early StP, higher knee flexion during the swing phase, and sustained ankle dorsiflexion at the end of the StP. Plantar pressure was increased at the heel, while pressures in the medial and lateral metatarsal regions, as well as the hallux and lesser toes, were significantly lower. SA results indicated a tendency to apply greater pressure on the non-dominant leg. BMD patients with symptom onset after the age of 16 exhibit gait compensation patterns similar to those observed in some DMD patients, with distinct differences in ankle joint behavior that warrant further investigation. Plantar pressure distribution may serve as potential clinical indicators for assessing disease progression."

    "abstract": "Tissue-engineered three-dimensional (3D) skeletal muscles can be potentially used in contractile force-based phenotypic screening to elucidate the mechanisms of skeletal muscle dysfunction and develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) expressing tetracycline-inducible myogenic differentiation 1 (MYOD1) are a promising cell source for construction of tissue-engineered skeletal muscles. Although we successfully constructed contractile tissues using these hiPSCs in a previous study, further improvements are required because of their weak contractile force and inefficient screening capabilities. In this study, we aimed to construct iPSC-derived muscle tissues with high contractile force using a 96-well scale microdevice that we had previously developed. To increase the contractile force, we optimized the time of supplementation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitor, SB431542 (SB), to identify culture conditions that enhance contractile force. The maximum contractile force with addition of SB was approximately five times greater than that without SB (58.45 ± 20.14 μN with SB compared to 11.64 ± 4.86 μN without SB). Various analyses, including immunostaining, transmission electron microscopy, gene expression analysis, and proteomics, revealed enhanced myotube differentiation and muscle tissue maturation in the presence of SB. Experiments using inhibitors indicated that TGFβ1, not myostatin, is partially involved in these effects. Furthermore, we confirmed that tissues constructed from iPSCs derived from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy also showed improved contractility following addition of SB. Therefore, iPSC-derived muscle tissues cultured with SB on the 96-well microdevice provide a promising platform for screening compounds that can ameliorate disease pathology."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to progressive muscle degeneration. Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors holds potential for treating DMD, but challenges such as immune responses and limited efficacy hinder its success. This study proposes a novel approach to improve AAV-based gene therapy by coating AAV vectors with a modified poly(β-amino ester) (pBAE) polymer featuring an NHS-activated acid moiety. The pBAE coating increases the positive surface charge of AAV particles, enhancing their transduction efficiency in muscle cells and reducing interactions with neutralizing antibodies. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that pBAE-coated AAVs exhibit improved transduction efficiency, stability under physiological conditions, and targeted muscle tissue expression. Additionally, the coating protects AAV from neutralizing antibodies and reduces their production, addressing significant limitations in AAV-based gene therapy. This strategy represents a promising advancement in enhancing the efficacy and safety of gene therapy for DMD and potentially other genetic disorders."

This article outlines the current status of serum biomarkers used for diagnosing and characterizing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a primary muscle wasting disease of early childhood due to primary abnormalities in the extremely large DMD gene. Reviewed are important aspects of the discovery, characterization and diagnostic value of biofluid-based protein markers of dystrophinopathy. This includes an overview of traditional general skeletal muscle damage markers, such as creatine kinase, myoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase, which have been used for many decades in clinical applications to evaluate patients with muscular weakness. In addition, this article outlines the biochemical identification of novel biomarker candidates focusing on the usage of mass spectrometry-based proteomic surveys to establish comprehensive profiles of protein alterations in dystrophinopathy. Pathoproteomic serum markers of myonecrosis with great potential for improved patient screening, differential diagnosis, stage-specific prognosis and therapeutic monitoring include specific isoforms of muscle-derived cytosolic proteins, such as carbonic anhydrase isoform CA3 and fatty acid binding protein FABP3, as well as sarcomeric proteins, including specific isoforms of myosin light chain, myosin binding protein, troponin, and myomesin, in addition to peptide fragments derived from the giant protein titin. Biofluid-associated marker proteins of reactive myofibrosis include the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, osteopontin, collagen and matrix-metalloproteinases."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a hereditary disease that requires gene or nucleic acid therapy, which involves muscle-targeted delivery of therapeutic material. We previously developed liposomes targeting muscle tissue in DMD model mice (mdx) using an A2G80 peptide, which has an affinity for α-dystroglycan abundantly expressed on the muscle cell membrane. However, these liposomes did not carry gene or nucleic acids. In this study, we aimed to develop muscle-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating luciferase mRNA and evaluate gene expression levels after systemic administration of these LNPs. We first evaluated the efficiency of mRNA delivery based on luciferase activity using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dimyristoyl glycerol (DMG) and PEG-distearoyl glycerol (DSG) in mdx systemic administration. PEG-DSG-LNPs showed lower luciferase expression in the liver and spleen and higher expression in mdx muscle tissue than PEG-DMG-LNPs. The addition of the A2G80 peptide to LNPs using PEG-DSG (A2G80-DSG-LNPs) significantly increased their activity in mdx but not in normal mice. These results suggest that A2G80-DSG-LNPs allow for muscle-targeted mRNA delivery and are useful tools for DMD treatment."

Our study aims to summarize and investigate the electrocardiographic characteristics of newly diagnosed DMD children. We conducted a single-center retrospective study to collect all DMD children diagnosed through genetic testing at Tianjin Children's Hospital from July 2018 to December 2023. 12‑lead ECGs were recorded and ECG parameters were manually measured. The comparative analyses were conducted to assess the differences in ECG parameters between DMD and normal children across various age and genotype subgroups. A total of 44 children diagnosed with DMD were retrospectively enrolled, including 43 males (97.7 %). The average age at diagnosis was 36.78 ± 21.69 months old. Comparison of ECG between the DMD group and control group suggested that the abnormal ECG parameters such as deepened Q wave amplitude in leads V5-V6 (p < 0.01), increased R wave amplitude in chest leads (p < 0.01), a higher R/S wave amplitude ratio in lead V1 (p < 0.01), and an increased Sokolow-Lyon index (p = 0.02). The results revealed after the age of 7, additional ECG abnormalities became evident, reflecting a progression in the severity and number of abnormalities with increasing age. The ECG abnormalities observed in this study could play a crucial role in supporting the early detection of DMD in resource-limited clinical settings."

The marketing authorization has been recently withdrawn by the European Commission following a recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency. This negative recommendation was based on the fact that three randomized controlled trials of ataluren in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (007, 020, and 041) have failed to show statistically significant differencs in favor of the treatment in the selected primary outcomes for each individual study, i.e., 6-min walk distance, in the intent-to-treat population for 007 and 020 and in a subgroup for 041. However, observed differences always favored treatment, and several clinically meaningful secondary outcomes were positive and statistically significant across studies. Importantly, the largest and longest phase III study (041) showed a statistically significant effect in favor of ataluren in the wider intent-to-treat population. Furthermore, a long-term registry of \"real-world\" ataluren treatment data (Strategic Targeting of Registries and Database of Excellence, STRIDE), in addition to confirming a reassuring safety profile, suggested a prolonged maintenance of ambulatory, upper limb, and respiratory function. We deem that a withdrawal of ataluren from the European market would harm not only patients with nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the whole neuromuscular field, in which clinical trials are challenging because of the heterogenous complex slow-progressing nature of the disorders."

The natural course of DMD results in a profound, progressive decline in muscle strength, requiring the use of a wheelchair, typically by age 13, and ultimately leading to fatal respiratory and cardiac dysfunction by young adulthood. Musculoskeletal care for patients with DMD often centers around preventing and managing contractures, fractures, and scoliosis. Medical considerations that affect musculoskeletal care include osteopenia and osteoporosis, endocrinopathies, and pulmonary diseases, which often affect perioperative care. This study aims to provide a detailed and updated review of current treatment options for DMD, highlighting the role of novel treatment options (eg gene therapy) that are changing the landscape of care for the DMD population. (1)Orthopaedic management of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy centers primarily around mobility preservation and managing contractures, scoliosis, and fractures.(2)Perioperative considerations include cardiology (ie preoperative echocardiogram for assessing cardiomyopathy progression), pulmonology (ie sleep-related breathing disorders that may result in compromised respiratory function intraoperatively), endocrinology (ie chronic glucocorticoid use that should not be paused in the perioperative period to prevent adrenal crisis), and anesthesiology (ie avoidance of depolarizing muscle relaxants).(3)As new gene-modifying treatments become available, the orthopaedic management of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy will continue to evolve rapidly."

This study introduces a novel method leveraging Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-derived step frequency from a single waist-worn consumer-grade accelerometer to predict gait parameters efficiently. The proposed FFT-based step frequency detection approach, combined with regression-derived stride length estimation, enables precise measurement of temporospatial gait features across various walking and running speeds. Our model, developed from a diverse cohort of children aged 3-16, demonstrated high accuracy in step length estimation (R2=0.92, RMSE=0.06 m) using only step frequency and height as inputs. Comparative analysis with ground-truth observations and AI-driven Walk4Me models validated the FFT-based method, showing strong agreement across step count, step frequency, step length, step velocity, and travel distance metrics. The results highlight the feasibility of using widely available mobile devices for gait assessment in real-world settings, offering a scalable solution for monitoring disease progression and mobility changes in individuals with DMD. Future work will focus on refining model performance and expanding applicability to additional movement disorders."

We compared dystrophic lines with a healthy wild-type control (HWT) by assessing microtissue formation ability, contractile function at multiple timepoints along with intracellular calcium dynamics via calcium imaging, as well as expression of myogenic markers. <b>Results</b>: We found patient-specific structural and functional differences in the early stages of 3D SkMO development. Contractile force, measured as both single twitch and tetanic responses, was significantly lower in dystrophic 3D SkMOs compared to HWT, with the most pronounced differences observed at day 7 of differentiation. However, these disparities diminished over time under similar culturing conditions and in the absence of continuous nerve-like stimulation, suggesting that the primary deficit lies in delayed myogenic maturation, as also supported by gene expression analysis. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our results underline that, despite the initial maturation delay, DMD muscle precursors retain the capacity to form functional 3D SkMOs once this intrinsic lag is overcome. This suggests a critical role of dystrophin in early myogenic development, while contraction-induced stress and/or an inflammatory microenvironment are essential to fully recapitulate dystrophic phenotypes in 3D SkMOs."

    "abstract": "Double homeobox (DUX) genes are key embryonic regulators that are silenced after the early cleavage stages of embryogenesis. Aberrant expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). A recent study reported that Dux, the murine ortholog of DUX4, contributes to the dystrophic phenotype in mdx mice, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model, and that its deletion enhances muscle regeneration by reducing oxidative stress. However, convincing evidence of Dux expression in either intact or injured muscle of wild-type (WT) and mdx mice remains lacking, raising questions about its role in muscle homeostasis. To investigate this, we assessed Dux expression in WT and mdx mice and used <i>Dux</i> knockout (Dux<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>) mice to evaluate its function during regeneration following cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced injury. Contrary to prior reports, Dux was not expressed in either WT or mdx mice. Moreover, Dux deletion did not enhance muscle regeneration or affect the expression of the oxidative stress regulator Nrf2 following CTX injury. Lastly, we confirmed that neither DUX4 nor its target genes were induced in muscle biopsies from DMD patients, excluding a role for DUX4 in DMD pathology. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Dux does not impact skeletal muscle regeneration or DUX4 contribution to the DMD dystrophic phenotype, directly challenging the conclusions of a previously published study. We comment on issues of editorial oversight that led to the publication of that study and highlight the deleterious impact of the growing wave of fraudulent publications."

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations in gene coding regions introduce an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC) in the mRNA transcript, resulting in the early termination of translation and the production of a truncated, nonfunctional protein. The absence of protein expression and the consequent loss of essential cellular functions are responsible for the severe phenotypes in the so-called genetic nonsense-related diseases (NRDs), such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Fabry disease, Choroideremia, Usher syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and even certain types of cancer. Nonsense mutations pose a significant challenge in the treatment of NRDs, as a specific approach directly addressing this genetic defect is currently unavailable. Developing new therapeutic strategies for nonsense suppression is a crucial goal of precision medicine. This review describes some of the most promising therapeutic approaches and emerging strategies for treating NRDs. It considered both the use of small molecules to interfere with molecular mechanisms related to nonsense mutations, such as translational readthrough-inducing drugs (TRIDs) or inhibitors of the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, and also innovative approaches involving nucleic acids, such as gene editing, anticodon engineered-tRNA (ACE-tRNA), or mRNA-based therapy. Future research should focus on refining these approaches and exploring integrated and personalized treatments to enhance therapeutic outcomes and ensure continuous improvement in the quality of care."

Impaired respiratory muscle performance, fibrosis and inflammation in early disease are evident in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse model of DMD. Prednisone or similar treatment is the current standard of care for DMD and exerts its benefits via an anti-inflammatory action, but chronic treatment is associated with side-effects. A recent study demonstrated improved function in mdx limb muscle with weekly glucocorticoid treatment compared with daily treatment. Herein, we investigated the effect of weekly α-methylprednisolone (PRED) treatment alone and the effect of PRED in combination with daily intake of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, NAC (PREDNAC) on respiratory performance. One-month-old male mdx mice received PRED (0.8 mg/kg methylprednisolone i.p. weekly) or PREDNAC (0.8 mg/kg methylprednisolone i.p. weekly and 1% NAC in drinking water daily) for 3 months. At 4 months of age, conscious breathing was measured in vivo by whole-body plethysmography. Under urethane general anaesthesia, respiratory EMG and inspiratory pressure were measured at baseline and during maximal activity. The intrinsic force-generating capacity of the diaphragm was determined ex vivo. Neither PRED nor PREDNAC influenced breathing or diaphragm force-generating capacity in mdx mice. There was a significant increase in diaphragm and parasternal EMG activity, but inspiratory pressure was unchanged with treatment. We conclude that neither PRED nor PREDNAC has a major beneficial effect on respiratory system performance in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Weekly administration of glucocorticoids is inadequate to protect respiratory performance in mdx mice, which might reflect the higher duty cycle of respiratory muscles compared with limb muscles."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder that impairs daily functioning and results in premature death. Current clinical assessments are widely used for characterizing functional impairment but have limitations due to their subjective and effort-based nature and because they only capture a snapshot of symptoms at a single point in time. Digital health technologies, such as wearable devices, allow continuous collection of movement and physiological data during daily life and could provide objective measures of the impact of DMD symptoms on daily functioning. For example, measurement of the 95th centile of stride velocity has recently gained endorsement by European regulators as an endpoint for evaluating functional changes in DMD, but the use of wearables for this purpose is just beginning. In this study, we present preliminary investigations of candidate digital biomarkers of functional impairment using real-world data and further explore the relationships between these parameters and established clinical assessments. We found nine candidate biomarkers for detecting DMD-related functional impairment, all exhibiting large to very large effect sizes in our sample of 14 boys with DMD and matched controls (9 DMDs, 5 controls, age 4-12 years). Each candidate biomarker was moderately or strongly associated with clinical measures of function in DMD. Six of the biomarkers are novel and/or understudied in DMD including objective measures of gait acceleration and variability; postural control immediately before and after a postural transition; and the smoothness of postural transitions. Notably, postural transition measures were more sensitive to DMD-related impairment than gait, activity, and cardiac measures. These results suggest that the quality of postural transitions could serve as a sensitive and objective measure of functional impairment in DMD and point toward the need for further exploration of these measures."

Unlike muscle, several dystrophin isoforms are expressed in the human brain, but a detailed map of regional and cellular localisation of dystrophin isoforms is missing. This is crucial in understanding the neuropathology of DMD individuals, and for evaluating the translatability of pre-clinical findings in DMD mouse models receiving genetic therapy interventions. Here, we provide a comprehensive dystrophin expression profile in human brains from early development to adulthood. We reveal expression of dp427p2, dp427c, dp427m and dp40 isoforms in human embryonic brains, not previously reported. We also detected dp427p2 expression and developmental regulation in human brain across the lifespan. In addition we showed by in situ hybridisation that dp140 was greatly downregulated in adult brains. Importantly, our data also demonstrate expression of DMD transcripts in human motor neurons and co-expression of different dystrophin isoforms within single neurons in both developing and adult brains. Finally, we show localisation of DMD transcripts with GAD1+ GABAergic-associated transcripts in neurons including cerebellar Purkinje cells and interneurons, as well as in the majority of neocortical and hippocampal SLC17A7+ glutamatergic neurons, suggesting a role for dystrophin in signalling at the neuronal inhibitory and excitatory synapses."

We completed an open-label, single dose pilot study of canakinumab 2 mg/kg subcutaneous injection in steroid naïve boys with DMD older than 2 years of age to determine safety and potential serum response biomarkers of efficacy at 4-weeks post treatment. Proteome profiling was performed using high throughput multiplexing aptamer SomaScan assay based technology targeting 1,500 unique serum proteins. Three subjects completed the study with no adverse events reported and no significant changes in safety labs. Proteomic analysis within 4 weeks of treatment identified significantly decreased inflammation associated factors including plasma serine protease inhibitor, interleukin-6 receptor alpha, Lymphocyte antigen 86, Immunoglobulin D and myostatin. Significantly increased proteins included muscle-associated proteins aldolase A and lactate dehydrogenase B. Canakinumab 2 mg/kg dose is safe for children with DMD and demonstrated potential response biomarkers of efficacy in treating related muscle disease. Canakinumab did not affect the circulating levels of IL-1β but did decrease some key proinflammatory markers and myostatin. Increased muscle specific proteins could be associated with increased physical activities or damage seen in young patients with DMD.

The meeting brought together researchers, clinicians, and patient advocates who shared experiences, discussed advancements in DMD respiratory management, and identified areas of debate that require further research. The speakers emphasized routine assessment of pulmonary function and of breathing during sleep to achieve timely diagnosis of respiratory complications. Therapeutic discussions focused on airway clearance and assisted ventilation, highlighting noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as the preferred modality, even for advanced respiratory failure. The respiratory implications of new pharmacological therapies were discussed. The speakers endorsed the importance of cardiorespiratory outcomes in assessments of drug efficacy. To assess a drug's clinical impact and to define current respiratory phenotypes, the trajectory of the absolute value of forced vital capacity (FVC) was proposed as a potentially better parameter than FVC percent predicted, which is favored in current drug studies. In regard to management of acute respiratory failure and perioperative situations, standards of care and areas needing future research were identified. In this meeting, many points of consensus emerged, as well as areas requiring further research. The necessity to involve patients and their families in all aspects of respiratory care was emphasized, as well as the need for patient centered outcomes in medical decision making and research."

Early-onset FSHD presents unique challenges, particularly in the context of managing early-acquired facial weakness, which significantly impacts functional and psychosocial well-being. Despite its clinical significance, the surgical outcomes of facial reanimation in this population have not been reported, and a standardized treatment protocol is lacking. This review seeks to address this gap by proposing a standardized diagnostic and management pathway for pediatric patients with early-onset FSHD presenting with facial paralysis. Our multidisciplinary diagnostic protocol includes comprehensive genetic testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyography, with assessments conducted by a collaborative team comprising Pediatricians, Neurologists, Geneticists, and Ophthalmologists. We discuss surgical strategies for facial reanimation, emphasizing their critical role in preserving psychosocial health and quality of life. By consolidating current knowledge and proposing a structured approach, this review aims to serve as a reference for clinicians and surgeons, guiding improved diagnosis, management, and outcomes in early-onset FSHD."

    "title": "Diffuse Active Myocarditis in a Teenager with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - a case report.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. These mutations result in the absence or reduced levels of dystrophin protein, leading to progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle deterioration. Cardiomyopathy is almost universally present in patients with DMD who survive into their third decade of life. The clinical onset of cardiac dysfunction is often asymptomatic and typically identified during routine evaluations. Acute deterioration of cardiac function in DMD patients is rarely reported in the medical literature. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with DMD and preserved left ventricular (LV) function who presented with severe retrosternal chest pain and electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Laboratory testing revealed significantly elevated troponin levels, though coronary CT angiography (CTA) was normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) confirmed diffuse active myocarditis, demonstrating inflammation and fibrosis involving both the septal and lateral walls-a pattern of fibrosis atypical for Duchenne cardiomyopathy. Diffuse active myocardial injury with the pattern of active myocarditis is one of the causes of rapid deterioration of LV dysfunction in Duchenne cardiomyopathy and can be detected by CMR."

    "abstract": "To quantify the magnitude of altruism value as applied to a hypothetical new treatment for a rare, severe pediatric disease: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Prospective survey of individuals not planning to have children in the future. A survey was administered to US adults (aged ≥ 21 years) not intending to have a child in the future to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for government insurance coverage for a new hypothetical DMD treatment that improves mortality and morbidity relative to the current standard of care. A multiple random staircase design was used to identify an indifference point between status quo government insurance coverage and coverage with additional cost in taxes that would cover the treatment if unrelated individuals had a child with DMD. Altruism value was calculated as respondents' mean WTP. Among 215 respondents, 54.9% (n = 118) were aged 25 to 44 years and 80.0% (n = 172) were women. Mean WTP for insurance coverage of the hypothetical DMD treatment for others was $80.01 (95% CI, $41.64-$118.37) annually, or $6.67 monthly, after adjustment to account for disease probability overestimation. The adjusted altruism value was higher than the ex ante per-person value using traditional cost-effectiveness approaches ($45.30/year). Without adjusting, individuals were willing to pay $799.11 annually ($66.59 monthly). Despite no possibility of accruing health benefits directly for themselves or their children, individuals had a high WTP for government insurance coverage of a novel treatment for this rare, severe pediatric disease."

    "abstract": "In inherited neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), glucocorticoids significantly slow disease progression yet impart side effects severe enough to preclude use in a significant proportion of patients. Extending our findings that acute treatment with FDA approved multiple sclerosis drug, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), rescues muscle pathology in juvenile mdx mice, we aimed to conduct tiered pre-clinical testing toward translation. To aggravate disease phenotype in adult mdx muscles that usually lack human equivalent muscle pathology, we used bi-weekly treadmill running for 4 weeks which increased plasma DMD biomarker, creatine kinase, by 2-fold and quadriceps fibrosis by ∼30 %. Using this model, we screened DMF for 5 weeks in a head-to-head comparison, and in combination, with standard-of-care prednisone (PRED), to model the most likely clinical trial scenario. We show comparable efficacy between DMF and PRED at reducing inflammation via NF-κB suppression and CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration. Moderate term DMF monotherapy had additional anti-fibrotic and anti-lipogenic effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle beyond those seen with PRED treatment, although combination therapy exacerbated fibrosis in quadriceps. Our study supports DMF as a repurposing candidate for DMD, especially for patients who cannot tolerate chronic glucocorticoid treatment. We also highlight the importance of evaluating combination therapy to identify potential off-target effects between emerging therapeutics and glucocorticoids towards better designed clinical trials."

This retrospective observational study has identified patients potentially affected by DMD and described their utilization of healthcare resources and direct healthcare costs charged to the Italian National Healthcare Service (INHS). From the Foundation Ricerca e Salute (ReS), through a specific algorithm based only on administrative healthcare data of 5.4 million inhabitants in 2021 (index date), male patients aged <30 years potentially affected by DMD were identified. Comorbidities at baseline, and utilization of healthcare resources and direct healthcare costs charged to the INHS during the year following index date, were described. In 2021, 120 male patients aged <30 years were identified as potentially affected with DMD (2.2/100,000 inhabitants; 16.1/100,000 males aged <30 years). Chronic airway disease and cardiomyopathy were found in 19.2% and 15.0% of patients, respectively. During follow-up: 41.7% of patients were treated with deflazacort, 2.5% with ataluren and about one third with cardiac drugs; 29.2% and 42.5% were admitted to overnight and day hospitalization, respectively, mainly due to neurological, cardiac, and respiratory diseases; 12.5% accessed the emergency department, mainly for traumatisms and fractures; 70.8% received local outpatient specialist care, half of which were specialist visits, and about 15% cardiac diagnostics. On average, the per capita annual total cost charged to the -INHS was € 6713; ataluren accounted for more than half of this expenditure. After having excluded the dispensation of ataluren during follow-up, the mean per capita total cost was € 2548, more than half of which due to hospitalizations. This study of administrative data has identified patients potentially affected by DMD, a rare disease, from a large sample of INHS beneficiaries, and assessed their healthcare pathway. This is useful for regulatory purposes and for improved access to emerging innovative therapies."

While antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping offers therapeutic potential, its efficacy in cardiac muscle remains limited. Here, we investigate DG9, a cell-penetrating peptide derived from human polyhomeotic 1 homolog (Hph-1) transcription factor, as an enhancer of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-based therapy targeting exon 44. In a humanized DMD mouse model (hDMDdel45;mdx), DG9-PMO significantly increases exon skipping, restores dystrophin expression, and improves muscle function, particularly in the heart. Mechanistically, DG9-PMO enhances intracellular uptake through multiple endocytic pathways and achieves superior nuclear localization. Compared to the benchmark R6G peptide, DG9-PMO exhibits greater efficacy in cardiac tissue with no detectable toxicity. These findings highlight DG9-PMO as a promising next-generation exon-skipping therapy with potential clinical relevance for improving both skeletal and cardiac outcomes in DMD patients."

This study introduces an ultrasound scatteromics approach to differentiate between early and late ambulatory stages of DMD. A total of 47 DMD subjects were divided into early (n = 23) and late (n = 24) ambulatory stages. Ultrasound images of the gastrocnemius muscle were acquired and processed to generate multimodal QUS envelope statistics images based on the Nakagami distribution parameter m, homodyned K-distribution parameters α and k, and information entropy H. A simplified feature set based on first-order statistical features of each QUS envelope statistics image was then used for classification with support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). A total of 30 iterations of five-fold cross-validation, along with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), were used for model evaluation. Individual QUS envelope statistics parameters produced average AUROC values below 0.7. Scatteromics achieved average AUROC values of 0.97, 0.98, and 0.83 for SVM, RF, and LDA models, respectively. The simplified scatteromics models, using m, α, k, and H as input to SVM, RF, and LDA, yielded average AUROC values of 0.98, 0.98, and 0.88, respectively. The scatteromics approach outperformed individual QUS envelope statistics imaging methods in monitoring ambulatory function deterioration in DMD in clinical settings (p < 0.05 for AUROC comparisons, DeLong test)."

    "abstract": "This Evidence in Focus reviews the current evidence on the efficacy and adverse effects of delandistrogene moxeparvovec in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and presents clinical considerations regarding use. The author panel systematically reviewed available clinical trial data on delandistrogene moxeparvovec in patients with DMD. The risk of bias was evaluated using the American Academy of Neurology's 2017 therapeutic classification of evidence scheme. Safety information, regulatory decisions, and clinical context were also reviewed. Six clinical trials were identified, of which 4 had peer-reviewed data available. From the 4 studies with available data (2 Class I and 2 Class III), exposure data are available on 134 boys, of which 128 are ambulatory and aged ≥4 to <8 years. Both Class I studies failed to meet the primary functional motor outcome as assessed by change in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment score. Several secondary functional motor outcomes demonstrated improvement in the treatment group with small effect sizes, not meeting statistical significance from hierarchical analysis. Corticosteroid dose exposure was higher in the treatment group in the first 12 weeks after infusion, potentially contributing to measured differences between groups. Safety outcomes were similar across studies with multiple treatment-related adverse events, including peri-infusion effects, immune myositis and myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and liver toxicity. One death has been reported in an individual who was treated with delandistrogene moxeparvovec outside of a trial. Despite not demonstrating efficacy in its primary outcome, delandistrogene moxeparvovec has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in boys with DMD. This decision was supported by the relative safety of the product and secondary outcome measures data in the phase 3 clinical trial. As the drug may now be actively prescribed in the United States and other countries after FDA approval, providers should be aware of the limitations of the treatment and the need to monitor for immune-related side effects including myocarditis, liver injury, and thrombocytopenia, which may require expanded clinical infrastructure. Additional clinical trials and careful collection of real-world evidence from treated patients will be essential to establish short-term and long-term effectiveness and inform understanding of benefits and risks of delandistrogene moxeparvovec across the lifespan."

    "abstract": "In normal mouse skeletal muscles, interval training (IT)-mimicking neuromuscular electrical stimulation enhances muscle fatigue resistance and mitochondrial content, with greater gains observed at high (100 Hz stimulation, IT100) compared to low (20 Hz stimulation, IT20) contractile load. In this study, we compared the effects of repeated IT100 and IT20 on fatigue resistance and mitochondrial adaptations in young male mdx52 mice (4- to 6-week-old), an animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Plantar flexor muscles were stimulated in vivo using supramaximal electrical stimulation to induce isometric contractions every other day for 4 weeks (a total of 15 sessions). In non-trained muscles of mdx52 mice, decreased fatigue resistance was associated with reduced citrate synthase activity, lower peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) protein expression, and diminished levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II, and an increased percentage of Evans Blue dye-positive areas. IT100, but not IT20, markedly improved fatigue resistance and restored all these alterations in mdx52 mice. Furthermore, an acute session of IT100, but not IT20, led to increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and elevated mRNA levels of PGC-1α, which were blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. These findings suggest that contractile load is a key determinant of isometric IT-induced improvements in fatigue resistance, even in dystrophin-deficient muscles, potentially through a p38 MAPK/PGC-1α-mediated increase in mitochondrial content."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating disease characterized by progressive muscle-wasting and a lack of effective therapy. Although the application of GsMTx4 has been shown to reduce muscle mass loss in dystrophic mice, the mechanism of action remains unclear. We employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing data to scrutinize the expression of mechanosensitive channels in skeletal muscle. The upregulation of PIEZO1 and its precise localization were corroborated in DMD patients, mdx mice, and activated satellite cells. To delve into the role of the GsMTx4-blocked PIEZO1 channel in the myogenic program, we conducted comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies encompassing the proliferation of satellite cells, differentiation of myoblasts, and calcium influx into myofibers. Utilizing both a PIEZO1 channel inhibitor, GsMTx4, and a PIEZO1 channel agonist, Yoda1, we explored the PIEZO1 channel's impact on satellite cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation. Additionally, we explored the protective effect of the PIEZO1 channel on myofiber calcium influx using mdx mouse models and isolated single myofibers. PIEZO1 was upregulated in the muscle of DMD patients and was predominantly expressed in satellite cells and upregulated during satellite cell proliferation. Treatment with GsMTx4 increased the cross-sectional areas of myofibers and reduced the proportion of centrally nucleated fibers in mdx mice. GsMTx4 inhibited satellite cell proliferation while promoting myogenic differentiation. During myogenic differentiation, the YAP nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio increased in cells treated with GsMTx4 and showed a significant correlation with the nuclear localization of MyoG. In myofibers, GsMTx4 significantly reduced the level of p-CaMKII/CaMKII in muscle and calcium load. PIEZO1 upregulation in DMD could potentially stem from an elevated proportion of proliferating satellite cells triggered by sarcolemma damage and muscle necrosis. The inhibition of the PIEZO1 channel by GsMTx4 plays a beneficial role in fostering myogenic differentiation and mitigating myofiber damage. The PIEZO1 channel emerges as a promising therapeutic target for addressing DMD."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-recognized pathological feature of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The potential regulatory role of mitochondria-related genes (MRGs) in DMD remains to be further explored. GEO datasets and MRGs were used to analysis mitochondrial scores and evaluate patients' immunological characteristics. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and MRGs were used to identify hub genes. A specific hub gene was selected, and the effects of this gene overexpression on a horse serum (HS) treated C2C12 cell in vitro model were investigated. Mitochondrial score was decreased in DMD group. Significant differences were observed in 12 immune cell types in normal/DMD and high/low mitochondrial score groups. 9 hub genes were identified, with 7 validated. Among them, VDAC1 was selected for further study. Overexpression of VDAC1 in HS C2C12 myoblasts promoted cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis rate and the Bax expression (with concurrent Bcl2 upregulation), diminished LDH release to reduce cytotoxicity, decreased intracellular ROS levels to alleviate oxidative stress, inhibited the expression of autophagy (LC3) and atrophy (Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1) markers, and promoted differentiation. In conclusion, VDAC1 may participate in the myoblast proliferation and myotube atrophy by influencing mitochondrial function, which may serve as a new target for DMD treatment."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to progressive muscle degeneration, loss of ambulation, cardiomyopathy, and early mortality. While advances in multidisciplinary care and pharmacological interventions, including corticosteroids and exon-skipping therapies, have improved patient outcomes, current treatments primarily provide symptomatic relief without addressing the underlying genetic defect. Gene therapy has emerged as a promising approach to modify disease progression, particularly through the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of micro-dystrophin constructs. These truncated genes retain essential functional domains, enabling the restoration of dystrophin expression within the packaging limits of AAV vectors. Early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated encouraging safety profiles and transgene expression; however, challenges such as immune responses, variability in functional improvement, and long-term durability remain. Recent innovations, including optimized AAV capsids, immunomodulatory strategies, and genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, are actively being explored to overcome these barriers. Additionally, scalable vector manufacturing and the integration of real-world data are essential for broader clinical translation. This review synthesizes current advancements, clinical milestones, and future directions in gene therapy for DMD, emphasizing the need for precise dosing, long-term efficacy, and equitable access to fully realize the therapeutic potential of these evolving strategies."

In a subset of patients in the EMBARK (A Gene Transfer Therapy Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Delandistrogene Moxeparvovec [SRP-9001] in Participants With DMD) randomized clinical trial, changes in muscle health and pathology were assessed to evaluate the therapeutic impact of the treatment on disease progression. To determine the effect of delandistrogene moxeparvovec on muscle quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) measures of disease progression in patients in the EMBARK trial. This was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled (October 2021-September 2023; week 52 cutoff date: September 13, 2023), multicenter randomized clinical trial that included 131 patients. Patients were randomized, and 125 were treated with either delandistrogene moxeparvovec (n = 63) or placebo (n = 62). The current study focused on a subset of patients who underwent muscle QMR imaging. Single-administration intravenous delandistrogene moxeparvovec (1.33 × 1014 vector genome/kg) or placebo. Change from baseline to week 52 in muscle MR was a prespecified exploratory end point. Proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) and 8-point Dixon MR imaging (MRI) measured muscle fat fraction (FF); multislice spin echo MRI measured transverse relaxation time (T2). MRS FF was measured in the soleus and vastus lateralis. MRI FF and T2 were measured in 5 leg muscle locations important for ambulation. A post hoc global statistical test combining all muscles and modalities assessed overall treatment effect. In this exploratory EMBARK analysis, 39 male participants (delandistrogene moxeparvovec, n = 19; placebo, n = 20; mean [SD] age, 6.10 [1.04] years; mean [SD] baseline North Star Ambulatory Assessment total score, 22.99 [3.71] points) underwent muscle MRI. Treated patients showed less disease progression vs placebo on MR measures. Across muscles and modalities, magnitudes of FF change favored delandistrogene moxeparvovec; between-group differences in least-squares mean change ranged from -1.01 (95% CI, -2.79 to 0.77; soleus) to -0.71 (95% CI, -3.21 to 1.80; vastus lateralis) for MRS FF and -3.09 (95% CI, -7.62 to 1.45; vastus lateralis) to -0.44 (95% CI, -4.01 to 3.12; hamstrings) for MRI FF. T2 reductions (improvements; 4 of 5 muscles) were observed in treated patients vs increases (worsening; all muscles) in placebo patients; within-group differences in least-squares mean change ranged from -1.06 (95% CI, -2.10 to -0.02; soleus) to 0.17 (95% CI, -1.76 to 2.10; biceps femoris) in the delandistrogene moxeparvovec group and from 1.12 (95% CI, 0.08-2.16; soleus) to 2.94 (95% CI, 0.84-5.03; quadriceps) in the placebo group. The global statistical test supported treatment benefit (P = .03). Results reveal that QMR outcomes consistently favored delandistrogene moxeparvovec across muscle groups, with treatment leading to decreased fat accumulation and improved T2 vs placebo over 52 weeks. Consistent with treatment effects on functional outcomes observed in the EMBARK trial, these results suggest stabilization or less progression of muscle pathology with delandistrogene moxeparvovec-adding to the totality of evidence supporting disease stabilization or slowing of disease progression with delandistrogene moxeparvovec.

Current research on motor measurements for these patients lacks assessments of the whole trajectories of the functional motions over time in clinical conditions. The main goal of this study was to compare the upper limb movement strategy of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and a healthy Control by assessing the contributions of chosen joint angles and contributions of muscles activity in the functional motions of activities of daily living. A novel score of kinematic and electromyographic patterns is proposed, and results are assessed for a whole trajectory of tested upper limb for five patients and a healthy Control. Contributions of four joint angles and four surface muscle activities are assessed for two relations - kinematic control (a relation between muscle activity and displacement of the wrist) and dynamic control (a relation between muscle activity and displacement of the center of mass of the upper limb). In vertical motions, higher mobility in the shoulder and elbow was observed in patients with lower Brooke scores. In motions involving horizontal movement of a weight, the contribution of the elbow and the trapezius were higher in all patients vs the Control. The proposed method revealed significant differences in muscle activity and upper limb movement patterns in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy compared with a healthy Control. Results of the assessment of contributions in kinematic control and dynamic control show individual movement strategies of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

Socioeconomic status (SES) is directly correlated with QoL of many chronic and life-threatening diseases. This study aimed to understand the socioeconomic determinants of the QoL in boys affected with DMD and their caregivers. Methods The present paper analyses the cross-sectional data of a prospective study involving boys aged 5 to 15 yr with DMD and their caregivers. HrQoL of boys was assessed using EQ 5D-3L tool and PedsQL3.0 Neuromuscular Module, and overall global QoL of caregivers was assessed using World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). SES was assessed using the OP Agrawal scale. EQ-5D utility index, using adult tariffs, was applied to the Indian paediatric population for the first time. The correlation and association between QoL and SES covariates were analysed with Spearman, linear, stratified analysis, and multiple linear regression. Results A total of 100 families of boys with DMD were enrolled [median age 9 yr (IQR: 7.0-9.0), 91% ambulatory]. HrQoL scores of children as mean (S.D) EQ 5D utility score and PedsQoL for physical health were 0.58±0.38 and 77.7±17.7, respectively. Both were inversely correlated with advancing age and clinical severity of disease. HrQoL of boys has no significant correlation with their socioeconomic status(r=0.04; P=0.708). The average QoL of caregivers was assessed as moderate to good across four domains of WHOQOL-BREF. The environment and social relationship domain of QoL caregivers was positively correlated to EQ 5D utility scores (r=0.22 P=0.028 and r=0.21 P=0.033). QoL of the caregiver's environmental health, social relationship, and psychological health were directly correlated with SES on multiple linear regression after adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical predictors. The quality of physical health of caregivers was independent of any factor. Interpretation & conclusions Overall QoL of children with DMD and primary caregivers was found to below, and the QoL of children is not affected by SES. HrQoL of boys with DMD was inversely associated with the age/ progression of the disease but not with the socioeconomic status of the families. Lower socioeconomic status is inversely associated with the QoL of caregivers. Hence, QoL in boys can be addressed by accessible and effective therapeutic interventions, while tailored interventions and support programmes like patient-centered care that empower lower socioeconomic status can improve the QoL of caregivers."

    "title": "Template-assisted sequence knockin rescues skeletal and cardiac muscle function in a deletion model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) poses challenges in therapy design due to dystrophin's complex role in maintaining muscle function since the restoration of truncated protein products has failed to completely address the disease's pathophysiology in clinical trials. As ∼70% of patients harbor deletions, strategies enabling targeted DNA insertion to restore full-length dystrophin protein are essential. Here, we present template-assisted sequence knockin (TASK), a strategy that we employed to specifically correct the Dmd Δ52-54 mutation in a murine model. By co-delivering a repair template and the Cas9 nuclease using AAV9s, the splice-competent sequence for Dmd exons 52-54 was integrated into the residual intron 54 locus, resulting in the systemic restoration of full-length dystrophin at therapeutically relevant levels in the heart and across all skeletal muscles, leading to significant functional improvements. TASK demonstrates the highest efficiency of exogenous DNA knockin reported to date, achieving rescue of key dystrophic hallmarks in a deletion model of DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive X-linked recessive disorder characterized by severe muscle degeneration and premature death, often due to cardiac complications. Despite the high prevalence of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy in DMD, the utility of Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in detecting subclinical cardiac dysregulation remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate alterations in Lead II ECG parameters in children with DMD, potentially indicating an elevated risk of Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD). In this cross-sectional study, Lead II ECG recordings from 54 genetically confirmed DMD patients were compared against 31 age-matched healthy-controls. Parameters analyzed included PR interval, QRS duration, QT and QTc intervals, Tp-Te interval, and amplitudes of P, Q, R, S, and T waves. Analysis was conducted using LabChart Pro 8 software and the Hamilton-Tompkins QRS detection algorithm. Heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was calculated using Bazett's formula (QTc = QT/√RR). An independent samples t-test with a significance level of p < 0.05 was used for comparisons between groups. The study revealed significant ECG alterations in the DMD group compared to controls, included a reduced PR interval, prolonged QRS and QT intervals, decreased QTc, and increased Tp-Te interval. Additionally, significant increases in P, Q, R wave amplitudes, and ST height were observed, indicative of atrial hypertrophy and potential ventricular arrhythmias. Lead II ECG analysis in children with DMD demonstrates critical alterations suggestive of subclinical cardiac dysregulation, highlighting a potential non-invasive marker for early detection of cardiac involvement. These findings emphasize the importance of regular cardiac monitoring in DMD patients to mitigate SCD risk through timely interventions and underscore the need for further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The aim of this scoping review was to examine the literature regarding the use of protein supplements to improve macroscopic muscle properties in a pediatric population in general, and more specifically in children with cerebral palsy. Based on our prospectively registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8DM9G), a systematic literature search was performed in five databases and two clinical registers. Studies were selected by two independent reviewers using predefined selection criteria, and data were summarized using a data extraction form. A broader search on adults with cerebral palsy and the general pediatric population was considered to be relevant due to the limited number of studies conducted in children with cerebral palsy. After deduplication, 5207 records were identified and screened. A total of 18 publications were included in the current review. Two studies were performed in individuals with cerebral palsy, eight in healthy children, two in children with respiratory problems, one in critically ill children, one in children with end-stage liver disease, one in children and adolescents undergoing treatment for a pediatric malignancy, one in children with Pompe disease and two in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The different muscle parameters reported were muscle volume, muscle mass, fat-free mass and fat-free mass index, lean body mass and lean body mass percentage, arm muscle area and muscle cross-sectional area of the arm, thigh and calf. The heterogeneity of the included studies and their moderate quality level made it difficult to draw solid overall conclusions. More research is needed on the use of protein supplements in children with cerebral palsy. However, supplementation with branched-chain amino acids, in particular leucine, might be promising."

    "abstract": "The approval of Duvyzat (givinostat) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) marks a significant milestone in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), offering renewed hope for patients and their families. DMD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, often leading to loss of mobility and life-threatening complications. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, and available treatments focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Duvyzat belongs to a class of drugs known as histone deacetylase inhibitors, which have shown promise in preclinical studies for their ability to modulate gene expression and potentially improve muscle function in DMD. Clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Duvyzat in DMD patients have demonstrated encouraging results, prompting the FDA's approval. The approval of Duvyzat represents a significant advancement in the field of DMD therapeutics, providing patients with a much-needed treatment option that targets the underlying mechanisms of the disease. By inhibiting histone deacetylases, Duvyzat has the potential to restore dystrophin expression, reduce inflammation, and preserve muscle integrity, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals with DMD. However, it is essential to recognize that while Duvyzat represents a step forward, it is not a cure for DMD. Continued research and development efforts are needed to further refine treatment approaches and address the complex challenges associated with this devastating disorder. Nonetheless, the approval of Duvyzat offers hope and optimism for the DMD community, signaling progress toward more effective therapies and improved outcomes for patients."

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in X chromosomes, either numerical or structural, cause X-linked disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Recent molecular and cytogenetic techniques can help identify DMD gene mutations. The accurate diagnosis of Duchenne is crucial, directly impacting patient treatment management, genetics, and the establishment of effective prevention strategies. This review provides an overview of X chromosomal disorders affecting Duchenne and discusses how mutations in Dystrophin domains can impact detection accuracy. Firstly, the efficiency and use of cytogenetic and molecular techniques for the genetic diagnosis of Duchenne disease have, thus, become increasingly important. Secondly, artificial intelligence (AI) will be instrumental in developing future therapies by enabling the aggregation and synthesis of extensive and heterogeneous datasets, thereby elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms. However, despite advances in diagnostic technology, understanding the role of Dystrophin in Duchenne disease remains a challenge. Therefore, this review aims to synthesize this complex information to significantly advance the understanding of DMD and how it could affect patient care."

EVs are intercellular mediators that significantly affect muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a fatal X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to muscle degeneration. <i>Mdx</i> mice are the most commonly used model to study the disease, and in this study, we phenotypically characterized plasma MVs from <i>mdx</i> mice by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of plasma MVs to modulate muscle inflammation, damage, and/or regeneration by intramuscular injection of MVs from <i>mdx</i> mice into <i>mdx</i> or DBA/2 mice as a control. In both mouse lineages, platelets and erythrocytes were the primary sources of MVs, and CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> MVs were observed only in <i>mdx</i> mice. We also observed that plasma MVs from <i>mdx</i> mice induced muscle damage in <i>mdx</i> mice but not in DBA/2 mice, while plasma MVs from DBA/2 mice did not induce muscle damage in either mouse lineage. These results indicate that plasma MVs from <i>mdx</i> are potentially pathogenic. However, this condition also depends on the muscular tissue status, which must be responsive due to active inflammatory or regenerative responses."

Givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has recently emerged as a promising disease-modifying therapy. This commentary examines the therapeutic potential of givinostat, its mechanism of action, and the clinical evidence supporting its role in DMD treatment. A review of the EPIDYS Phase 3 trial and supporting clinical studies was conducted. The study included boys aged 6 to 17 years with genetically confirmed DMD, assessing givinostat's efficacy and safety over 18 months. Key endpoints included the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), MRI-based muscle preservation, and adverse event (AE) profiles. Givinostat-treated patients demonstrated a 1.9-point higher NSAA score compared to placebo (<i>P</i> = 0.03), with significant reductions in muscle fat infiltration (40% lower than placebo; <i>P</i> < 0.05). Functional tests showed trends toward improved stair-climbing ability, though not statistically significant. AEs included thrombocytopenia (20%) and hypertriglyceridemia (10%), necessitating monitoring but remaining manageable. Givinostat represents a paradigm shift in DMD management, offering benefits beyond corticosteroids by reducing fibrosis and promoting muscle regeneration. While its long-term safety and cost-effectiveness require further evaluation, its combination potential with gene therapies highlights its importance in future DMD treatment strategies. Ongoing studies aim to refine its role in broader neuromuscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disease caused by the absence of functional dystrophin in the muscle cells. Recent untargeted metabolomics studies identified amino acid metabolism alterations as biochemical pathways potentially involved in DMD pathogenesis. Here, in a well-characterised cohort of DMD children and paediatric controls, we investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) the serum profile of a selected pool of amino acids in D- and L-configuration, including L-glutamate, L-glutamine, glycine, L-aspartate, D-aspartate, L-asparagine, L-serine, and D-serine. These amino acids are known to modulate neurotransmission and to play essential roles in energy and skeletal muscle metabolism. HPLC determinations highlighted a general amino acid deregulation in DMD compared to controls, including lower levels of L-aspartate, L-asparagine, D-serine, L-glutamine, and glycine and D-/Total serine ratio. In control subjects, we observed a significant positive correlation between L-glutamine and age, which lacked in affected children. Conversely, in DMD, we observed (i) a negative correlation of L-glutamate and L-aspartate with serum creatinine and creatine kinase levels; (ii) a direct correlation of serum L-glutamine/L-glutamate ratio with the fat-free mass index (as determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) and with specific motor function scores (North Star Ambulatory Assessment); and (iii) no correlations between glucocorticoid treatment or cognitive function and the serum amino acid profile. Our study highlights significant correlations between serum L-glutamate levels, L-glutamine/L-glutamate ratio, and the multidimensional measures of muscle wasting and motor impairment, suggesting that peripheral glutamine-glutamate metabolism can be a suitable biomarker of disease severity and progression in DMD patients."

Forskolin (FSK), an adenylyl cyclase activator, has shown potential in enhancing muscle regeneration and limiting muscle stem cell senescence. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of FSK on muscle repair, fibrosis, inflammation, and long-term muscle function in DMD using a preclinical rat model. BaCl<sub>2</sub>-induced muscle injury was performed on 6-month-old DMD (R-DMDdel52) and wild-type (WT) rats. FSK was supplied via short-term and long-term administration. Muscle tissues were harvested 14 days post-injury for histological analysis, including hematoxylin and eosin and Sirius red staining. Immunofluorescence was used to assess fibroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs), regeneration, muscle stem cells, and macrophage phenotypes. Moreover, we performed a study by chronically administering FSK to DMD rats from 1 to 7 months of age, either intraperitoneally (IP) or subcutaneously (SC). Functional assessments included grip strength test, in vivo muscle force measurements, plethysmography and electrocardiograms. Post-sacrifice, Tibialis anterior, diaphragm and heart tissues were histologically analyzed, to evaluate muscle architecture, fibrosis, and histopathological indices. FSK treatment significantly improved muscle histology and reduced fibrosis in both uninjured and injured DMD muscles by decreasing the number of FAPs. Long-term FSK treatment in the acute injury model enhanced muscle regeneration, increased MuSC proliferation, and reduced senescence. FSK also modulated inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory macrophages and promoting a shift to a restorative phenotype. However, despite these histological improvements, FSK treatment from 1 to 7 months resulted in limited functional benefits and worsened ventricular histology in the heart. FSK shows promising results in improving muscle regeneration and reducing fibrosis in DMD, but concerns remain regarding its limited chronic functional benefits and potential adverse effects on cardiac tissue. Our results highlight the need for optimized adenylyl cyclase activators for therapeutic use in DMD patients."

In this study, we assessed the gut microbiota in 50 genetically confirmed DMD patients (median age 13.1 years) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Cognitive assessment was performed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales, with ID defined as an IQ < 70. Stool samples were analyzed, and statistical methods were used to assess alpha- and beta-diversity. Thirty-four percent of patients had ID. No significant differences were found in alpha-diversity or in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. However, beta-diversity analysis revealed significant differences between DMD + and DMD - groups, including, in DMD + , an increased abundance of Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and a reduction in Bulleidia. These bacteria are involved in metabolic pathways that can influence neurological health through the gut-brain axis, particularly via the production of short-chain fatty acids. While these preliminary findings suggest a possible association between gut microbiota profile and cognitive impairment in DMD, further research is needed to explore a causal relationship and consider microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease that affects males in the pediatric age group. Currently, there is no painless, cost-effective prognostic method available to monitor DMD progression. The main hypothesis of this study was that the biochemical composition of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the urine of DMD patients can be distinctly differentiated from that of healthy controls using surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) combined with machine learning models. This differentiation is expected to provide a noninvasive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic tool for the early detection, staging, and monitoring of DMD by identifying the molecular signatures captured by SERS and leveraging the analytical power of machine learning algorithms. We collected fasting morning urine samples from 52 DMD patients and 17 healthy controls and isolated EVs using a Total Exosome Isolation kit. The SERS substrates are prepared using silver nanoparticles, which were employed to capture the molecular fingerprints of the EVs with uniformity and reproducibility, achieving relative standard deviation values of 7.3% and 8.9%. We observed alterations in phenylalanine and α-helical proteins in patients with DMD compared to controls. These spectral data were analyzed using PCA, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms to identify distinct patterns and stage DMD based on biochemical composition. Our integrated approach demonstrated 60% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing DMD patients from healthy controls, highlighting the potential of SERS and KNN for noninvasive, accurate, and rapid diagnosis of DMD. This method offers a promising avenue for early detection and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Muscle weakness and contractures cause gait deficits in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but their relative contributions are poorly understood and hence it is unclear whether contractures should be treated. Therefore, we aimed to differentiate the effect of muscle weakness in isolation from weakness and contractures combined on the gait patterns. We used computer simulations that generate gait patterns based on a musculoskeletal model (without relying on experimental data) to establish the relationship between muscle impairments and gait deviations. We previously collected a longitudinal database of 137 repeated measurements in 30 boys with DMD and found that the data measured through 3D gait analysis could be clustered in three gait patterns. We estimated weakness based on data from fixed dynamometry, and contractures based on goniometry and clinical measures. Foot deformities were modeled by reducing the height of all foot segments and decreasing the strength of the intrinsic foot muscles. We created musculoskeletal models that either represented (1) the mean weakness; (2) the mean weakness and contractures; or (3) the mean weakness, contractures and foot deformities, in each gait pattern. Simulations based on models with both weakness and contractures captured most (but not all) experimentally observed gait deviations, demonstrating the validity of our approach. While muscle weakness was primarily responsible for gait deviations, muscle contractures and foot deformities further contributed to gait deviations. Interestingly, the simulations predict that the combination of increasing weakness and contractures rather than increasing weakness alone causes loss of ambulation for the most affected gait pattern. Predictive simulations have the potential to elucidate causal relationships between muscle impairments and gait deviations in boys with DMD. In the future, they could be used to design targeted interventions (e.g. stretching, assistive devices) to prolong ambulation."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle dystrophies comprise a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness, with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) being among the most severe. These dystrophies are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, resulting in muscle cell instability, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and impaired muscle regeneration. Although skeletal muscle has intrinsic regenerative potential via satellite cells, the ongoing muscle damage in DMD/BMD depletes these cells and promotes fibrosis. Inflammation also plays a pivotal role, with immune cell infiltration correlating with disease severity. This study investigates fibrosis, inflammation, and capillarization in BMD patients across different age groups to clarify how disease progression varies over time. Morphological analyses of muscle biopsies revealed an increase in connective tissue, particularly in adult patients. Pediatric patients showed reduced capillarization, whereas adult patients displayed vascular adaptations, including elevated capillary-to-fibre ratios and capillary contacts, indicative of compensatory mechanisms in response to chronic muscle degeneration. Inflammatory profiles also varied with age: younger adult patients exhibited a predominance of CD68-positive macrophages, while older adults demonstrated increased CD4/CD8 T-cell activity. Our findings highlight pronounced age-dependent differences in muscle pathology, encompassing structural adaptations, fibrosis, and inflammation, which may be crucial for developing age-tailored therapeutic approaches."

Its pronounced antibacterial properties render it an appealing candidate for combating multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the unique readthrough-promoting activity makes it a subject for research as a potential therapeutic agent for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other hereditary diseases. Here we use the unusual (R)-β-lysine found in negamycin as a guide to identify the biosynthetic pathway of negamycin and then carry out gene deletion and chemical complementation, stable isotope feeding and enzyme assays to elucidate the key precursors for negamycin assembly. Our work identified NegB as a lysine-2,3-aminomutase that converts lysine into (R)-β-lysine and NegJ as a heme-dependent, N-N bond-forming enzyme. We show that NegJ, together with a ferredoxin encoded outside of the negamycin gene cluster, directly forms hydrazinoacetic acid from glycine and nitrite. NegJ is a novel biocatalyst for N-N bond formation, and our work highlights its potential for genome mining of N-N bond-containing natural products."

Current data from long-term real-world usage of these ASOs suggests a broad safety profile and a delay in muscle deterioration. Nevertheless, the exon-skipping efficacy and dystrophin protein production of these ASOs are limited, suggesting the need for more efficient ASOs. Over the past decade, many studies have focused on improving ASO efficacy by incorporating novel chemical modifications or bioconjugations of a variety of moieties including peptides or antibodies to increase their cellular uptake by muscle cells, their endosomal escape, and their nuclear import to boost therapeutic efficacy. Many of these newly developed exon-skipping ASOs have been studied in clinical trials in DMD patients, and early findings suggest clear improvements in molecular efficacy compared to the earlier version of ASOs, although the safety track record may not be the same as the first-generation compounds.

    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked inherited muscle disease. Patients with DMD demonstrate improved prognosis with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers at the time of cardiac dysfunction. However, most deaths due to DMD are due to cardiac dysfunction. Fragmented QRS (fQRS) is an abnormal finding that forms a notch in the QRS wave on electrocardiography (ECG) and is associated with fibrosis and scarring of the myocardium. <b>Methods</b>: Patients with DMD were examined for the number of leads of fQRS, their sites of appearance, changes in cardiac dysfunction, and age using the chest leads of a synthesized 18-ECG. A retrospective analysis of 184 patients under 20 years of age with DMD and known genetic mutations was performed; they were divided into three age groups: 3-10, 11-15, and 16-20 years. The chest leads of the ECG were defined as follows: V1-3, anterior leads; V4-6, lateral leads; V7-9, posterior leads; and V3R-V5R, right-sided chest leads. Cardiac dysfunction was defined as a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <53% on the same day, and echocardiography was performed. LV dilation was defined as dilation beyond the normal range, considering the body surface area. <b>Results</b>: In 167 of 184 patients (91%), fQRS was present in one or more chest leads. The number of fQRS leads in the anterior and lateral walls was significantly higher in 16-20-year-olds than in 3-10-year-olds. The total number of chest leads with fQRS was 4.9 ± 3.1 in the cardiac dysfunction group and 3.5 ± 2.5 in the preserved group. The cardiac dysfunction group had a significantly greater number of fQRS leads than did the preserved group (<i>p</i> = 0.003). The group with LV dilation had a significantly greater number of fQRS leads than did the non-dilation group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). <b>Conclusions</b>: The fQRS site is associated with age, cardiac dysfunction, and LV dilation. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the number of anterior leads of the fQRS correlated with age and that of lateral leads of the fQRS with cardiac dysfunction and LV dilation. The number of fQRS leads on the lateral wall marks cardiac dysfunction and LV dilation."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene resulting in cycles of muscle degeneration, inflammation and regeneration. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a key functional outcome measure for DMD patient clinical trials and has been adapted for use in animal models of the disease. The DE50-MD dog model of DMD closely reflects the DMD patient phenotype prior to loss of ambulation. For pre-clinical trials using this model, functional outcome measures must be established. This longitudinal study compared distance walked in a 6MWT by DE50-MD and WT control dogs and assessed the utility of the 6MWT as a functional biomarker. Dogs underwent two 6MWTs conducted approximately 48-hours apart, at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age. In addition, we evaluated the stability of selected blood-borne biomarkers in 12-month old DE50-MD and WT dogs 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours following a 6MWT. DE50-MD dogs exhibited significantly shorter 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) than WT dogs at all timepoints (P<0.05), with no difference in 6MWD between the first and second 6MWT. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), myomesin-3 (MYOM3) and myostatin (MSTN) were biomarkers of the DE50-MD phenotype that remained unchanged in DE50-MD dogs following the 6MWT, while creatine kinase (CK) activity significantly increased 3-hours following the test in DE50-MD dogs but remained unchanged in WT dogs. The 6MWT effectively discriminates DE50-MD from WT dogs aged 3-18 months and a single 6MWT is sufficient for future studies. Serum MYOM3, CCL2 and MSTN are good biomarkers of the DE50-MD phenotype that are unaffected by the relatively low level exertion performed in the 6MWT by 12-month-old DE50-MD dogs."

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all children, including those with disabilities, should be physically active for optimal health benefits. The primary aim of this study was to quantify and describe overall physical activity (PA) levels and sedentary behavior in Norwegian boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), in comparison with healthy controls. Boys aged 5-18 years with DMD were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Sedentary time, light PA, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were measured with use of an accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Data on PA were obtained via self-report questionnaires. Comparisons were drawn between ambulatory and non-ambulatory boys with DMD, and between ambulatory boys with DMD and healthy controls, with data retrieved from a database. Twenty-eight boys with DMD participated, with a mean age of 12.6 (standard deviation 3.6) years, of whom 24 had accelerometry data. Ambulatory boys had higher PA levels compared with non-ambulatory boys (p = 0.008), and 53% of ambulatory boys met the WHO's recommendation for daily MVPA, whereas none of their non-ambulatory counterparts did. Boys with DMD were less physically active compared with healthy peers. Sedentary time was higher over weekends compared with weekdays, and increased with age both in the DMD group and in healthy controls. Further research is needed to improve participation in PA by exploring barriers and facilitators, with a particular focus on non-ambulatory boys with DMD."

    "title": "The effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac function of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: benefit or not?",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, incurable X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, resulting in functional dystrophin deficiency. Currently, cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in patients with DMD. Glucocorticoids are considered the gold standard treatment for children with DMD. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can delay the loss of independent ambulation, improve lung function, and extend lifespan. However, the effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac function in patients with DMD remain controversial. This scoping review aims to summarize and analyze published clinical studies investigating the effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac function in children with DMD. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases with relevant search terms. Abstracts and full texts of retrieved studies were reviewed. The studies were categorized into four themes: glucocorticoid use, Types of glucocorticoids, administration methods, and timing of glucocorticoid initiation. A total of 21 studies were included. Of these, 18 studies investigated the effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac function in patients with DMD, and the study of Koeks et al. reported both effective and non-effective outcomes of glucocorticoids on cardiac function stratified by age group, respectively. One study examined the impact of different glucocorticoid types, one study assessed the effects of glucocorticoid administration methods and one study evaluated the timing of glucocorticoid initiation. Among the 21 studies, 13 studies (n = 1814 patients) indicated that glucocorticoids could delay the progression of cardiac dysfunction in patients with DMD. Six studies (n = 6294 patients) reported no significant effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac function, while one study (n = 111 patients) suggested that early glucocorticoid therapy increased the risk of cardiomyopathy. It has been suggested that corticoids may delay the deterioration of cardiac function in patients with DMD. However, limited data exist on the long-term effects of early glucocorticoid therapy on cardiac function, leading to inconclusive findings. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to determine the optimal timing, dose regimen, and long-term impact of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with DMD. • The effects of glucocorticoids on cardiac function in patients with DMD remain controversial. • Glucocorticoids can delay the deterioration of cardiac function in DMD patients. However, prospective longitudinal studies are still needed to determine the optimal timing, dose regimen, and long-term effect of glucocorticoid therapy in DMD patients."

    "title": "LncRNA-MEG3 Regulates Muscle Mass and Metabolic Homeostasis by Facilitating SUZ12 Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining motor function and metabolic homeostasis, with its loss or atrophy leading to significant health consequences. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in muscle biology; however, their precise roles in muscle function and pathology remain to be fully elucidated. This study demonstrates that lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is preferentially expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers and dynamically regulated during muscle development, aging, and in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Using both loss- and gain-of-function mice models, this study shows that lncRNA-MEG3 is critical for preserving muscle mass and function. Its depletion leads to muscle atrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired regenerative capacity, while overexpression enhances muscle mass, increases oxidative muscle fiber content, and improves endurance. Notably, lncRNA-MEG3 overexpression in MDX mice significantly alleviates muscle wasting and adipose tissue infiltration. Mechanistically, this study uncovers a novel interaction between lncRNA-MEG3 and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), where lncRNA-MEG3 binds to SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (Suz12), stabilizes PRC2, facilitates SUZ12 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and regulates the epigenetic modulation of four and a half lim domains 3 (Fhl3) and ring finger protein 128 (Rnf128). These findings not only highlight the crucial role of lncRNA-MEG3 in muscle homeostasis but also provide new insights into lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies for muscle-related diseases."

    "abstract": "Fibrosis, characterized by the deposition of excess and disorganized extracellular matrix (ECM), is a key pathological hallmark of multiple diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Aiming to inhibit fibrosis progression, we generated an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that delivers an innovative small molecule conjugate to inhibit the ECM-modifying enzyme Lysyl oxidase (LOX) specifically in fibrotic lesions by targeting M2 macrophages. Administration of the ADC to <i>mdx</i> mice, the murine model of DMD, results in ADC accumulation in fibrotic muscles without affecting healthy tissues. Long-term ADC treatments of adult <i>mdx</i> mice lead to inhibition of the fibrotic process and to significant improvement of cardiac and skeletal muscle function. Our study demonstrates that targeted inhibition of LOX-dependent fibrotic diseases, such as DMD, facilitates improved outcomes for muscular dystrophies."

    "title": "Pharmacology and macrophage modulation of HPGDS inhibitor PK007 demonstrate reduced disease severity in DMD-affected muscles of the mdx mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disease characterised by chronic inflammation, progressive muscle damage, and muscle loss. Typically, initial symptoms affect lower limb muscles, including the gastrocnemius (GA), tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL). During the acute phase of DMD, particularly in boys aged 2-8 years, muscle damage resulting in necrosis (myonecrosis) involves a complex immune-inflammatory response. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is recognised for enhancing pro-inflammatory chemokine and interleukin signalling and recruiting infiltrating immune cells such as pro-inflammatory macrophages, exacerbating myonecrosis. To reduce levels of PGD2, a novel hematopoietic prostaglandin D2 synthase (HPGDS) inhibitor, PK007, was characterised (i) for potency and pharmacokinetic profiles and then tested in the mdx mouse model of DMD during the acute early onset of disease progression. Juvenile mdx and wild type (WT) C57Bl/10Scsn mice were orally treated with PK007 and control vehicle solution for 10 days, from postnatal day 18 to 28. This builds upon a previous study with PK007 with (ii) additional analyses of disease progression assessed for muscle grip strength, metabolic and locomotor activity, myonecrosis in a wide range of muscles (3 from hindlimb, diaphragm, heart, and tongue), macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS). PK007 exhibited high potency (17.23 ± 12 nM), a long half-life (3.0 ± 0.3 h), and good oral bioavailability (81%). Treatment with PK007 decreased serum PGD2 levels (33.36%) in mdx mice compared to control (vehicle-treated) mdx mice. In mdx mice (compared with controls), PK007 enhanced grip strength (69.05% increase) and improved locomotor activity (69.05% increase). Histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in the total myonecrotic area in PK007-treated GA (49.75%), TA (73.87%), EDL (60.31%), diaphragm (48.02%), and tongue (37.93%) muscles of mdx mice (compared with controls). Additionally, PK007 decreased macrophage cell area by 55.56% in GA and 47.83% in EDL muscles. Further expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes such as TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS were significantly reduced in PK007 treated mice. These results demonstrate that PK007 significantly reduces the inflammatory response, protects muscles from necrosis and increases strength in juvenile mdx mice. This study lays a strong foundation for progressing the use of HPDGS inhibitors such as PK007, which specifically inhibit PGD2 and reduce inflammation, as a viable therapeutic approach for DMD. This approach protects dystrophic muscles from necrosis and reduces the severity of this debilitating disease, improving outcomes and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Delayed puberty and osteoporosis are significant challenges in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The current International Care Considerations for DMD recommend bisphosphonate after first fracture and testosterone for delayed puberty from 12 years. This study aimed to investigate the current clinical practices of clinicians managing osteoporosis and testosterone treatment in DMD. An online survey was circulated to paediatric clinicians involved in the management of bone health and puberty in DMD via patient groups (UK, USA, Italy, Israel). A total of 51/105 (48 %) responses were received. For osteoporosis, vertebral fracture of any grade (86 %) and long bone fracture (67 %) were the most common indications for starting bisphosphonates, with IV zoledronate being the most used agent (86 %). Approaches varied in managing bisphosphonate side effects, and transitioning care to adult specialists. Opinions differed on starting bisphosphonate before fracture. Fourty-nine clinicians managing pubertal disorders reported initiating testosterone for delayed puberty typically between 12 and 14 years, with majority prescribing intramuscular injections (96 %). Duration of testosterone therapy varied, with some using short-term courses and others continuing until adulthood. This international survey highlights variability in the management of osteoporosis and delayed puberty in DMD. Recommendations on management of side-effects of IV bisphosphonate, osteoporosis therapy during transition, and longer-term treatment into adulthood is required. There is a need for further guidance on testosterone therapy, particularly in regard to monitoring after discontinuation and the threshold for re-initiation of treatment."

    "title": "Oestrogen Receptor Alpha in Myocyte Maintains Muscle Regeneration in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function and regulating metabolism in skeletal muscle. However, its alterations and potential mechanisms in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) remain incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrated the protective role of ERα in myocyte for skeletal muscle regeneration in mdx mice and explored the therapeutic effects of oestrogen receptor modulators on DMD. DMD patients' biopsies were obtained for histological analysis to explore the expression of ERα. The phenotype of muscle was analysed by histology and molecular biology. The therapeutical effect of different oestrogen receptor modulators was examined in mdx mice treated with fulvestrant (FVT, 20 mg/kg once a week) or oestradiol (E2, 1 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks. The protective effect of ERα was performed on mdx mice after conditional knockout of ERα in skeletal muscle (ERα<sup>mKO</sup> mdx mice). Evidence of activation of ERα/oestrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα)/myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) signalling pathway was inspected in the primary myoblasts isolated from mice, and C2C12 cells received intervention with E2/FVT/Esr1-siRNA/Esrra overexpression plasmid. The ERα expression was increased in DMD patients' triceps (p < 0.05) and mdx mice muscles (p < 0.05). FVT reduced ERα levels in the mdx mice muscles (p < 0.01) but had no significant effect on skeletal muscle regeneration on mdx mice. Compared with mdx mice, E2 reduced the levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001) in serum, enhanced skeletal muscle function, alleviated skeletal muscle atrophy and fibre loss and upregulated the expression of ERα in GAS (p < 0.001) and TA (p < 0.05). The myogenic factors such as myosin heavy chain (MyHC, p < 0.001), myogenin (MyoG, p < 0.05), MyoD (p < 0.05) and ERRα (p < 0.001) were increased in mdx mice GAS with E2. But E2 had no effect on ERα<sup>mKO</sup> mdx mice. The primary myoblasts and C2C12 were treated with E2 displayed an increased-on myocyte fusion index (p < 0.05), ERα MyoD and ERRα expressions (p < 0.05). The myocytes' fusion index (p < 0.05) and ERα, MyoD and ERRα expression (p < 0.05) were decreased in si-Esr1-transfected C2C12 cells and increased in OE-Esrra-transfected C2C12 cells. We demonstrated that ERα in myocyte exerted a protective effect on skeletal muscle regeneration in DMD patients and mdx mice through the ERα-ERRα-MyoD pathway, which has potential implications for DMD therapy strategies."

    "abstract": "Quantitative muscle MRI commonly evaluates disease activity and muscle wasting in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Disturbances in ion homeostasis contribute to DMD pathophysiology, but their relationships with disease progression is unclear. <sup>23</sup>Na MRI may provide insights into the disease course and treatment response. This longitudinal study assessed whether sodium levels are elevated in DMD patients regardless of fat fraction (FF) and whether baseline sodium levels influence FF changes over time. Additionally, we quantified the effect of slice selection on measured sodium values. Thirteen DMD boys (age 7.8 ± 2.4 years) underwent MRI of lower leg muscles at 3T at three visits, spaced 6 months apart. We assessed FF for disease progression and water T<sub>2</sub>, pH, apparent tissue sodium concentration (aTSC), and intracellular-weighted <sup>23</sup>Na signal (ICwS) for disease activity. Fourteen healthy boys (age 9.5 ± 1.7 years) underwent the same MRI protocol once. Linear regression and mixed-effect modelling were used to examine sodium level increases and their impact on FF changes. In DMD, muscles with FF < 10% exhibited significantly elevated aTSC (24.8 ± 4.6 mM vs. 14.5 ± 2.1 mM in controls, p < 0.001) and higher ICwS (23.6 ± 2.5 a.u. vs. 14.1 ± 2.1 a.u., p < 0.001). At Visit 1, FF values showed a significant negative association with aTSC (β = -17.30, p = 0.016) and ICwS (β = -21.02, p < 0.001). The first mixed-effect model, which assessed aTSC alone, showed no significant effect on FF progression but indicated a weak trend (p = 0.098). The second, more comprehensive model-incorporating also ICwS and water T<sub>2</sub>-revealed that FF changes were positively associated with aTSC (p = 0.0023) and negatively associated with ICwS and wT<sub>2</sub> (p < 0.001 and p = 0.025, respectively), with ICwS showing a significant interaction with time (p = 0.0033). Varying slice positioning and slice number demonstrated minimal impact on aTSC and ICwS, with low CV (2%-4%) in the mid-belly region. The study demonstrates significant MRI-based changes related to dystrophic alterations in DMD. We identified early alterations in sodium homeostasis, independent of FF. Our findings suggest that the relationship between sodium levels and FF progression is complex and may not be fully explained by total sodium measurements alone. Given the small sample size, further validation in larger cohorts is needed. Combined <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>23</sup>Na-MRI may offer deeper insights into how metabolic and ionic changes interact with FF progression and overall disease activity."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder affecting 5% to 19% of carriers. Creatine kinase (CK) is a traditional biomarker for DMD, but its screening accuracy is limited. This study evaluated the potential of combining the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET) with CK-MM to enhance screening efficacy. Creatine kinase-MM and RET levels were analyzed in 14 adult and 5 newborn carriers of DMD, along with noncarrier control individuals. The CK-MM/RET ratio was calculated, and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated biomarker screening efficiency. Methods for extracting RET from dried blood spots (DBSs) were compared with correlations between DBSs and serum RET levels and stability under varying storage conditions. Carriers of DMD exhibited elevated CK-MM and CK-MM/RET ratios with reduced RET. The CK-MM/RET ratio had the highest screening efficiency. Extraction of RET was optimal using Diluent C at 4 °C overnight, showing a strong DBS-serum correlation; RET remained stable, except under high humidity and temperature conditions. Combining RET with CK-MM enhances DMD carrier screening, offering a more efficient DBS-based method for early detection."

    "abstract": "The CRISPR system has emerged as a ground-breaking gene-editing tool, offering promising therapeutic potential for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 5000 male births globally. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes a critical membrane-associated protein essential for maintaining muscle structure, function and repair. Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle degeneration, loss of ambulation, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac failure, with most succumbing to the disease by their third decade of life. Despite the well-characterized genetic basis of DMD, curative treatments- such as exon skipping therapies, micro-dystrophin, and steroids- remain elusive. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the promise of CRISPR-based approaches in restoring dystrophin expression across various models, including human cells, murine systems, and large animal models. These advancements highlight the potential of gene editing to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the disease. However, significant challenges persist, including immunogenicity, off-target effects, and limited editing efficiency, which hinder clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest developments in CRISPR-based therapeutic strategies for DMD. It emphasizes the need for further innovation in gene-editing technologies, delivery systems, and rigorous safety evaluations to overcome current barriers and harness the full potential of CRISPR/Cas as a durable and effective treatment for DMD."

Here, we describe our experience diagnosing a 6-year-old male Chinese patient presenting with an atypical phenotype and two genetic causative factors who was ultimately diagnosed with coexisting WD and DMD. We used a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the patient's history, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and genetic testing to make the diagnosis. The patient was treated for one year with therapy to inhibit copper absorption and an anti-inflammatory treatment, and their condition remained stable. This case suggests that the inflammatory response could be a common pathogenesis between these two diseases. It also demonstrates the clinical efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapy for WD with DMD. Furthermore, this case illustrates the importance of taking a detailed history and performing thorough physical examinations to diagnose coexisting hereditary diseases."

    "abstract": "L-arginine induces the expression of utrophin in skeletal muscle cells, so it has been proposed as a pharmacological treatment to attenuate the symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). On the other hand, it has been described that one of the pathways that participates in the expression of utrophin in muscle is the Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/ErbB receptors pathway. Several studies have postulated that disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 (ADAM17) causes the proteolytic processing of NRG of transmembrane, allowing the release of NRG to the medium, which when joining its ErbB receptor activates the signaling pathway that triggers utrophin transcription. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of L-arginine in the activation of NRG-1/ErbB pathway and utrophin mRNA levels in C2C12 cells, and the participation of ADAM17 in this process. Our results indicate that L-arginine induces phosphorylation of ErbB2 and increases utrophin mRNA levels in C2C12 myotubes, with a maximum increase of 2-fold at 4 h post-stimulation. This effect is not observed when the myotubes are stimulated in the presence of GM6001 (general metalloprotease inhibitor) or PD-158780 (specific inhibitor of ErbB receptor phosphorylation). Experiments performed by flow cytometry suggest that L-arginine stimulates ADAM17 activation in our study model. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis supports our findings that L-arginine stimulates ADAM17 increase in treated myotubes. However, our results using pharmacological inhibitors suggest that ADAM17 does not participate in utrophin expression in C2C12 cells treated with L-arginine. The results obtained help to clarify the mechanism of action of L-arginine in the expression of utrophin in muscle cells, which will contribute to the design of new therapeutic strategies in pathologies such as DMD."

In Romania, ongoing efforts aim to enhance multidisciplinary collaboration, though systemic barriers, such as fragmented healthcare services, persist. Nonsense mutations, including those in exon 30 described here, are often associated with more severe disease progression. We present the case of a 17-year-old Romanian <i>DMD</i> patient with a nonsense mutation in exon 30 of the dystrophin gene. The patient received multidisciplinary pediatric care addressing his medical needs, including neuromuscular, respiratory, cardiac, and orthopedic management. Transition readiness was assessed using the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ), and the patient's perspective on the process was documented. Care followed international standards, but the disease progressed predictably, with gradual loss of ambulation, respiratory decline, and cardiac complications. The TRAQ revealed strengths in communication with healthcare providers but moderate confidence in self-management tasks. From the patient's perspective, fragmented adult services and difficulty accessing specialized neuromuscular support remain major obstacles, underscoring the importance of early, structured transition planning and patient-centered approaches. Transitioning to adult services requires strong communication between pediatric and adult teams and integration of specialized care. Tailored follow-up plans ensure continuity of care and effective disease management. This case reflects broader needs in similar healthcare contexts, highlighting the necessity of robust transition frameworks to respond to patient-specific challenges and ultimately support long-term quality of life."

Tadalafil, a once-daily PDE5 inhibitor, did not slow loss of ambulation in a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. This report details the cardiac findings from this study. Patients with DMD (N = 331) aged 7 to 14 years on stable glucocorticoids were randomized to tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg/day, 0.6 mg/kg/day, or placebo. Ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening, and M-mode ventricular dimensions were measured on echocardiograms. 12-lead ECGs were centrally evaluated for heart rate and intervals, and qualitative diagnoses. Vital signs and unsolicited adverse events were collected throughout the study. Cardiac MRI (CMR) was collected in a subset of 27 patients. Z-scores for ventricular dimensions and volumes were calculated based on published age-normative reference values. Treatment differences for change in continuous ECG parameters and vital signs were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Echocardiogram and CMR parameters were analyzed with an ANCOVA model. Tadalafil had no adverse effects on echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) EF or fractional shortening, ECG findings, or vital signs. Mean diastolic LV internal dimension (LVIDd) was increased in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group versus placebo at Week 24 (+ 0.13 cm, p =.019) and Week 48 (+ 0.18 cm, p =.008), with a similar pattern observed for LV systolic dimensions (LVIDs). Mean LV end diastolic volume (EDV) measured by CMR also increased at Week 48 in the tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg (+ 13.0 ml, p =.047 vs. placebo) and 0.6 mg/kg (+ 12.0 ml, p =.08 vs. placebo) groups, with numerically smaller increases in LV EDV and commensurate increases in stroke volume and cardiac output. Z-scores for LVIDd and LV EDV were generally below the normal range at baseline and increased toward or within the normal range in the tadalafil groups but not in the placebo group. No adverse effects of tadalafil on cardiovascular function were evident based on adverse events, echocardiograms, ECG, or vital sign measurements through 48 weeks in patients with DMD. The small mean increases in LVID and LV volume observed with tadalafil are consistent with PDE5 inhibitor pharmacology, but their clinical relevance in the context of LV tonic contraction in DMD is unknown and deserve further study.

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases to identify studies comparing daily versus intermittent prednisone in DMD treatment. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024549050). After the systematic search, 6 trials were included in the pooled analysis. Intermittent prednisone was associated with a higher prevalence of cushingoid appearance (RR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.17 to 2.51; <i>P</i> = 0.005), excessive hair growth (RR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.24; <i>P</i> = 0.02), and hypertension (RR: 3.42; 95% CI: 1.87 to 6.25; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences between daily versus intermittent prednisone in terms of forced vital capacity (FVC), blood pressure, loss of ambulation, weight changes, weight gain, bone fracture, behavioral changes, and DEXA lumbar spine Z-scores. No significant differences in efficacy outcomes regimens were observed. However, intermittent prednisone was associated with a higher prevalence of certain adverse effects, such as cushingoid appearance, excessive hair growth, and hypertension. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians when choosing treatment strategies and highlight the need for personalized approaches to minimize side effects while maintaining efficacy."

We used immortalized fibroadipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) and differentiated them into fibroblasts or adipocytes. The method successfully identified FAPs cell differentiation fate using accurate measurements of changes in specific proteins, which ultimately constitute a valid cellular <i>in vitro</i> platform for drug screening. Results were confirmed using primary FAPs differentiation as well as comparison with omics data from proteomics and genomic studies. Our method allowed us to screen 508 different drugs from 2 compounds libraries. Out of these 508, we identified 4 compounds that reduced fibrogenesis and adipogenesis of ≥30% of fibrogenesis and adipogenesis using immortalized cells. After selecting the optimal dose of each compound, the inhibitory effect on FAP differentiation was confirmed by using primary FAPs from healthy subjects (n = 3) and DMD patients (n = 3). The final 4 selected hits reduced fibrogenic differentiation in healthy and DMD samples. The inhibition of adipogenesis was more evident in DMD samples than healthy samples. After creating an inhibitory map of the tested drugs, we validated the signalling pathways more involved in FAPs differentiation analysing data from proteomic and genomic studies. We present a map of molecular targets of approved drugs that helps in predicting which therapeutic option may affect FAP differentiation. This method allows to study the potential effect of signalling circuits on FAP differentiation after drug treatment providing insights into molecular mechanism of action of muscle degeneration. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparing the signal pathway activity obtained after drug treatment with proteomic and genomic data from patient-derived cells."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked genetic disorder marked by progressive muscle degeneration and early cardiac involvement, with cardiac dysfunction as a major contributor to mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DMD-associated cardiac dysfunction remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms and identify gene expression patterns associated with disease progression. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from two patients with DMD exhibiting severe and mild motor impairment and differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). The resulting iPSC-CMs expressed myocardial markers, with genetic analysis confirmed dystrophin deficiency in DMD iPSC-CMs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles, with severe DMD iPSC-CMs exhibiting upregulation of the positive regulation of the transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway, leading to reduced proliferation, while mild DMD iPSC-CMs showed increased PI3K-Akt signaling and metabolic activity. Severe DMD iPSC-CMs also displayed more pronounced arrhythmicity, with significant correlation between dilated cardiomyopathy signaling changes and heart rate differences. This study establishes an iPSC-CM model for DMD cardiomyopathy, revealing altered gene expression and signaling pathways involved in cardiac dysfunction. Although non-allelic effects and unquantified differentiation efficiency may impact interpretation, these findings highlight key molecular alterations and offer potential therapeutic targets to improve cardiac outcomes in DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating genetic disorder, whose management is still a major challenge, despite progress in genetic and pharmacological disease-modifying treatments have been made. Mitochondrial dysfunctions contribute to DMD, however, there are no effective mitochondrial therapies for DMD. SIRT1 is a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase that controls several key processes and whose impairment is involved in determining mitochondrial dysfunction in DMD. In addition to well-known resveratrol, other potent selective activators of SIRT1 exist, with better pharmacokinetics properties and a safer profile. Among these, SRT2104 is the most promising and advanced in clinical studies. Here we unveil the beneficial effects of SRT2104 in flies, mice, and patient-derived myoblasts as different models of DMD, demonstrating an anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and pro-regenerative action of the drug. We elucidate, by molecular dynamics simulations, that a conformational selection mechanism is responsible for the activation of SIRT1. Further, the impact of SRT2104 in reshaping muscle proteome and acetylome profiles has been investigated, highlighting effects that mimic those induced by exercise. Overall, our data suggest SRT2104 as a possible therapeutic candidate to successfully counteract DMD progression."

    "abstract": "Although eccentric contraction protocols are widely used to study the pathophysiology and potential treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), they do not reflect the stresses, strains, strain rates, and excitation profiles that DMD muscles experience during human daily functional tasks, like walking. This limitation of eccentric contractions may impede our understanding of disease progression in DMD and proper assessment of treatment efficacy. The goals of this study were to examine the extent of force loss induced by a gait cycling protocol we developed, and compare to that from a typical eccentric contraction protocol in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of mdx mice. To achieve this goal, mdx soleus and EDL muscles were subjected to eccentric contractions at three levels of strain (10%, 20% and 30% optimal length Lo) and up to 200 cycles of our gait cycling protocol that mimicked the length changes and excitation patterns of the corresponding muscles during human walking gait. Our results showed that EDL but not soleus muscles had significant losses in isometric tetanic forces after the cycling protocols. Compared to the eccentric contraction protocol, the decrements in contractile performance from the cycling protocol were similar to those from the eccentric contractions at 10% in soleus and 20% Lo in EDL. Together, these results indicated the gait cycling protocol is a valuable experimental approach to better understand disease progression and to screen and evaluate efficacy of novel therapeutics for DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. Prescribed moderate exercise in patients is beneficial, but concerns remain due to the vulnerability of dystrophic muscle to damage. Voluntary wheel running (VWR) is a self-regulated form of exercise that improves muscle health in the typical C57.mdx mouse model of DMD. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of VWR in more severe and clinically relevant D2.mdx mice. Male D2.mdx animals were assigned to a sedentary (D2.mdx SED) or VWR group for 8-10 weeks, whereas DBA/2J wild-type mice served as healthy, sedentary controls (WT SED). Selective skeletal muscle mass and ex vivo force generation were elevated in D2.mdx animals that ran a relatively high volume (D2.mdx High VWR; 1.84 ± 0.84 km/day) compared to low-volume runners (D2.mdx Low VWR; 0.46 ± 0.31 km/day) and SED counterparts. VWR did not exacerbate the dystrophy, and instead attenuated the fibrotic profile compared to D2.mdx SED mice. A VWR-induced shift towards a more slow, oxidative phenotype was also observed. Mitochondrial respiration was reduced in D2.mdx SED animals versus WT SED mice but was partially restored following both Low and High VWR. Finally, a dose-dependent increase in the expression of mitochondrial proteins was observed following VWR, whereas markers of mitochondrial fusion were particularly elevated in D2.mdx High VWR mice. Our results indicate that VWR enhances muscle and mitochondrial biology in D2.mdx animals and further supports the therapeutic role of exercise for DMD patients. KEY POINTS: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a life-limiting neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. Skeletal and cardiac muscle quality is compromised in the dystrophic condition. Exercise promotes functional and molecular adaptations in healthy individuals and mild dystrophic mouse models. However, the effects of exercise in more severe and clinically relevant models of DMD require investigation. A relatively high volume of voluntary wheel running (VWR) augmented selective muscle mass and muscle function without exacerbating the dystrophic pathology in D2.mdx mice. Volitional exercise normalized dystrophic skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and upregulated mitochondrial content compared to sedentary counterparts. A higher dose of VWR increased organelle fusion protein expression compared to both healthy and dystrophic sedentary animals, as well as D2.mdx mice that ran lower volumes. Our results provide evidence from a severe preclinical model that volitional exercise may be a safe and efficacious lifestyle-based intervention for DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is a severe progressive form of muscular dystrophy which manifests in boys at the age of 1-8 years. The disorder is mainly characterized by proximal muscle weakness, which leads to impaired movement and subsequently total disability. DMD/BMD is caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene, which lead to a deficit in the production of various dystrophin isoforms. Seeing as the disorder was characterized many years ago, the DMD mutation spectrum has been described by multiple authors around the world. The most common variants are gross deletions and duplications of one or multiple exons, comprising 55%-65% and 6%-11% of all variants in this gene respectively. Other DMD/BMD cases (20%-30%) are caused by point variants. The current study describes the full spectrum of point variants in the DMD gene among Russian patients, analyzing the variant distribution in the gene and establishing the repeating variants in the examined cohort. Such comprehensive analysis is essential for genetic counseling and disorder prognosis, as well as determining the suitable therapeutic approach in each particular case."

A multicentre, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted, including boys 6-16 years with DMD with forced vital capacity >30% predicted to undergo conventional treatment or conventional treatment and manual LVR twice-daily for two years. Outcome was HRQOL measured by two validated instruments (PedsQL, DMD PedsQL) every 6 months. Sixty-two boys (33 LVR group and 29 controls), median (IQR) age 11.4 (9.4,13.4) years completed the study. Median (IQR) baseline HRQOL assessed by parent/caregiver PedsQL was 58.0 (41.9, 67.0) and 55.2 (47.8, 63.5) for the LVR and control groups. HRQOL trajectories were stable over the 2-year study period except parent communication, which improved. No statistically significant interactions were detected between visit and treatment group for any PedsQL outcomes. DMD PedsQL communication scores in the LVR group showed more positive change compared to controls. Treatment scores in the LVR group showed less positive change over time compared to controls; however, after correcting for multiple testing, were no longer significant. Respiratory symptom rate did not differ between groups and was not associated with any HRQOL outcome. There was no difference in HRQOL between the LVR and control groups after two years. The burden of LVR did not appear to adversely affect HRQOL."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, resulting in loss of functional dystrophin protein in muscle. While phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are promising exon-skipping therapeutics aimed at restoring dystrophin expression, their effectiveness is often limited by poor muscle delivery. We developed AOC 1044, an antibody-oligonucleotide conjugate (AOC) that combines a PMO-targeting exon 44 with an antibody against the transferrin receptor (TfR1), enhancing delivery to muscle tissues for patients with DMD amenable to exon 44 skipping (DMD44). AOC 1044 induces dose-dependent exon 44 skipping and its mouse-active variant elicited dose-dependent dystrophin restoration in skeletal and cardiac muscle in a DMD mouse model. This treatment also reduced muscle damage, as evidenced by decreases in serum creatine kinase and key liver enzymes, suggesting that restored dystrophin is functionally active. In nonhuman primates, single or repeated AOC 1044 doses resulted in dose-dependent increases in PMO concentration and exon 44 skipping across a range of muscle tissues, including the heart. Collectively, these findings highlight AOC 1044 as a promising therapeutic candidate for patients with DMD44, offering improved muscle targeting and meaningful dystrophin restoration, with potential clinical benefits in reducing muscle degeneration."

    "abstract": "Carriers of genetic diseases including female carriers of X-linked disorders are traditionally believed to be asymptomatic due to the compensatory presence of the unmutated gene on the other allele. However, in recent decades numerous contributions have appeared in the literature showing how females carrying X-linked diseases can also present signs and symptoms linked to the specific gene defect. To explain the clinical manifestations observed in female carriers, several mechanisms leading to a reduced protein expression have been hypothesized, in particular the role of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). In this review, the focus will be on the relationship between skewed XCI and the development of muscle or cardiac symptoms in female carriers of the most frequent types of muscle disorders such as Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and Myotubular Myopathy. In all cases, there is a tendency for females with a more severe phenotype to have a skewed pattern of XCI, while females with an intermediate phenotype have a random pattern. Given the increasing recognition of important clinical presentations in females with X-linked muscle disorders and the recent availability of causal therapies for these diseases, specific guidelines are desirable and recommended that allow women to be properly recognized and have access to appropriate therapies."

    "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is indispensable for overall health. Sub-optimal PA is linked to reduced quality of life (QOL) and premature death. In clinical research and therapeutics development, defining aspects of PA that are meaningful to patients and care providers is essential for designing tailored interventions, identifying individual contextual factors, and enhancing patient satisfaction and engagement in their own well-being. As digital health technologies (DHTs) measuring PA rapidly evolve, there is an opportunity to further define concepts. A systematic review of qualitative studies to identify concepts of PA that are meaningful to patients and care providers was conducted. Conditions covered included Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, chronic heart failure, sickle cell disease, osteoarthritis, and sarcopenia. We analyzed studies published in the last 20 years utilizing qualitative or mixed methods techniques to describe aspects of PA that patients want to prevent from worsening or improve. Among the 5228 articles returned, 105 studies were included. Thematic synthesis revealed five meaningful aspects of health (MAH) related to PA: ambulation-dependent activities, balance-dependent activities, activities needing upper limb function, changing body positions, and participating in activities of different intensities. Patients also reported PA as important to QOL and influenced by internal and external facilitators and barriers. This research presents new findings related to PA MAHs across various therapeutic areas, which go beyond walking. The findings provide a foundation for defining concepts of interest, measures, and endpoints, with applications in clinical research and care, including patient-focused development of digitally derived measures."

    "abstract": "Forty years after the dystrophin gene was cloned, significant progress has been made in developing gene therapy approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The disorder has presented numerous challenges, including the enormous size of the gene (2.2 MB), the need to target muscles body wide, and immunogenic issues against both vectors and dystrophin. Among human genetic disorders, DMD is relatively common, and the genetics are complicated since one-third of all cases arise from a spontaneous new mutation, resulting in thousands of independent lesions throughout the locus. Many approaches have been pursued in the goal of finding an effective therapy, including exon skipping, nonsense codon suppression, upregulation of surrogate genes, gene replacement, and gene editing. Here, we focus specifically on methods using AAV vectors, as these approaches have been tested in numerous clinical trials and are able to target muscles systemically. We discuss early advances to understand the structure of dystrophin, which are crucial for the design of effective DMD gene therapies. Included is a summary of efforts to deliver micro-, mini-, and full-length dystrophins to muscles. Finally, we review current approaches to adapt gene editing to the enormous DMD gene with prospects for improved therapies using all these methods."

    "abstract": "Endurance exercise triggers adaptive responses especially in slow-twitch myofibers of skeletal muscles, leading to the remodeling of myofiber structure and the mitochondrial network. However, molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptive responses, with a focus on the fiber type-specific perspective, remains largely unknown. In this study we analyzed the alterations of transcriptomics and metabolomics in distinct skeletal myofibers in response to endurance exercise. We determined that genes associated with sphingolipid metabolism, namely those encoding SPHK1, S1PR1, and S1PR2, are enriched in slow-twitch but not fast-twitch myofibers from both mouse and human skeletal muscles, and found that the SPHK1-S1PR pathway is essential for adaptive responses of slow-twitch to endurance exercise. Importantly, we demonstrate that endurance exercise causes the accumulation of ceramides on stressed mitochondria, and the mitophagic degradation of ceramides results in an increase of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) level. The elevated S1P thereby facilitates mitochondrial adaptation and enhances endurance capacity via the SPHK1-S1PR1/S1PR2 axis in slow-twitch muscles. Moreover, administration of S1P improves endurance performance in muscle atrophy mice by emulating these adaptive responses. Our findings reveal that the SPHK1-S1P-S1PR1/S1PR2 axis through mitophagic degradation of ceramides in slow-twitch myofibers is the central mediator to endurance exercise and highlight a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating muscle atrophy diseases.<b>Abbreviations</b> CQ: chloroquine; DMD: Duchenne muscular dystrophy; EDL: extensor digitorum longus; FCCP: carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone; FUNDC1: FUN14 domain containing 1; GTEx: genotype-tissue expression; MYH: myosin heavy chain; mtDNA: mitochondrial DNA; PPARGC1A/PGC-1α: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha; RG: red gastrocnemius; S1P: sphingosine-1-phosphate; S1PR: sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor; Sol: soleus; SPHK1: sphingosine kinase 1; TA: tibialis anterior; WG: white gastrocnemius."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disorder that leads to severe disability and premature death in young men. As DMD is caused by the absence of dystrophin, therapeutic development has focused on strategies to restore dystrophin expression. These include readthrough of premature stop codons, exon skipping to restore the reading frame, and gene therapy. The first two methods are mutation-specific, benefiting only subsets of patients, whereas gene therapy could treat all individuals with DMD. Immunogenicity of dystrophin may challenge these efforts. The immune system can recognize dystrophin as a neo-antigen, just as it can recognize newly arising antigens present on mutated cells. An in-depth evaluation of anti-dystrophin immune response as a factor affecting the treatment effectiveness is needed. Key questions include the underlying mechanisms of immunity induction by antigenic epitopes of the re-expressed dystrophin, the impact of such responses on the therapeutic efficacy, and the role of patient-specific risk factors, such as preimmunization due to revertant fibres, chronic muscle inflammation, pre-existing T lymphocytes reactive to dystrophin, which avoided deletion in dystrophic thymus, or antigen cross-reactivity. Patients' immune status assessment before treatment may help mitigating anti-dystrophin responses. Exploring potential therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment outcomes is also essential: Since DMD can be diagnosed at birth, early dystrophin re-expression could prevent damage and also potentially induce neonatal tolerance. In older patients, carefully managed immunosuppression and tolerogenic protocols could pave the way for more successful dystrophin replacement therapies."

Consequently, mdx<sup>5cv</sup>-<i>JAG1</i> muscles were significantly bigger and stronger than dystrophic controls, along with an increased number of myofibers. Proteomics data show increased dysferlin in mdx<sup>5cv</sup>-<i>JAG1</i> muscles and an association of Nsd1 with the phenotype. Our data supports the positive effect of <i>JAG1</i> overexpression in dystrophic muscles."

    "abstract": "This case report describes initiation of Nocturnal Non-Invasive Ventilation in home settings for two adolescents with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and different neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive comorbidities: one has Autism Spectrum Disorder, and the other has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, obsessive thinking and anxiety. This report emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary team approach, incorporating medical, psychological and psychopharmacological interventions for successful Non-Invasive Ventilation implementation. Challenges include recognition of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive comorbidities often seen in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Lessons learned from these cases underscore the importance of: coordinated multidisciplinary efforts, early advanced care planning, accurate psychoeducation, cautious psychopharmacological interventions, and parental and patient involvement. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing implementing Nocturnal Non-Invasive Ventilation in home settings in adolescents with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive comorbidities. In conclusion, implementation at home can be successful and become a realistic target for each individual with Duchenne Muscular dystrophy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic progressive neuromuscular disorder characterized by early-onset proximal muscle weakness and significant long-term pulmonary and cardiac involvement. Due to the early pharmacological treatments and the wider adoption of non-invasive ventilation, life expectancy has significantly increased in recent years, highlighting the relevance of DMD-related cardiomyopathy and fatal arrhythmias, especially in the late stage of the disease. Current guideline-derived evaluation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in DMD lacks accuracy, leading to inadequate arrhythmic risk stratification and jeopardized SCD prevention strategies. This review aims to outline these critical issues, proposing an integrative approach encompassing manifold tools such as an imaging-derived systematic and comprehensive evaluation (speckle-tracking echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging), the electrophysiological study, the 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping, and a multidimensional clinical examination. This approach might lead to more personalized management along with an effective arrhythmia-prevention strategy aiming to balance clinical care goals, patient expectations, and ethical considerations."

    "abstract": "Premature termination codon (PTC) diseases account for ∼12% of all human disease mutations. Although there are no FDA approved treatments for increasing PTC readthrough, one readthrough inducing drug, ataluren, has conditional approval for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy elsewhere. Ataluren displays low toxicity in clinical trials for treatment of PTC diseases, but its therapeutic effects are inconsistent. The messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence context of a PTC is a major determinant of PTC readthrough efficiency. We have shown that ataluren stimulates readthrough exclusively by competitively inhibiting release factor complex (RFC) catalysis of translation termination. Here, using an in vitro reconstituted system, we demonstrate that PTC identity and the immediately adjacent mRNA sequence contexts modulate RFC activity in terminating peptide elongation. Such modulation largely determines the effectiveness of ataluren in stimulating readthrough, whether added alone or in combination with either the aminoglycoside G418 or an anticodon edited aa-tRNA, which stimulate readthrough by mechanisms orthogonal to that of ataluren. Our results suggest a potential rationale for the variability of ataluren effectiveness in stimulating readthrough. We hypothesize that patients harboring a PTC mutation within a sequence context promoting strong interaction with RFC will be resistant to ataluren, but that ataluren treatment will be more effective for patient sequences conferring weaker interaction with RFC."

    "abstract": "Mutation of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene causes neuromuscular disorders, but increasing evidence has implicated DMD in the development and progression of several major cancer types. This study investigates the prognostic and biological significance of DMD expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed that high DMD expression correlates with improved overall (median survival difference: 22 months, p = 0.0083) and progression-free (p = 0.0237) survival. The Dp71ab transcript is most strongly associated with better outcomes (median overall survival: 42 months, p = 0.0007). Notably, DMD expression levels stratify HPV-positive patients, identifying a DMD low/HPV-positive subgroup with poor outcomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of 50 HNSCC tissue cases confirmed dystrophin localisation in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with high nuclear expression linked to longer overall survival (mean difference: 31 months, p = 0.0497). Functional assays in HNSCC cells showed that Dp71ab overexpression disrupts nuclear morphology and reduces proliferation. Differential gene expression analysis additionally identified 388 upregulated and 30 downregulated genes, with pathways linked to muscle processes, ribosome biogenesis and non-coding RNA regulation. These findings highlight DMD as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target in HNSCC, warranting further mechanistic studies of Dp71 isoforms."

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of rare neuromuscular diseases often relies on muscle biopsy analysis, which varies based on the evaluator's experience. Advances in deep learning show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy by identifying standardized features and phenotypic expressions in biopsy images. Explainable artificial intelligence extracts these features from the neural network's \"black box,\" ensuring compliance with European ethical standards for the use of clinical data in real-world applications. This study proposes a clinic-friendly workflow, based on explainable artificial intelligence. It combines forward-forward and backpropagation-trained convolutional networks to identify complementary features of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Our proposal sets the forward-forward training, applied here for the first time on biomedical images, as a potential new standard for interpretable deep learning applications in clinics. We analyzed a multiphoton microscopy dataset of 1600 images from 16 human muscle biopsies obtained during elective spinal surgery, combining autofluorescence, second and third harmonic generation signals. Class Activation Maps unveiled the dual decision-making process of the convolutional network, independently trained with both standard backpropagation and forward-forward algorithms. We evaluated the significance of the discovered features by using the Mann Whitney method. Entire biopsies were analyzed by providing an attention metric, computed as the weighted mean of all significant parameters. Backpropagation, gold standard for 35 years, and forward-forward achieved over 90 % accuracy in distinguishing healthy and diseased patients tissue. Class activation maps revealed that, when trained independently with both algorithms, the same network identifies Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy tissue by focusing on different features. Both methods identified intramuscular collagen as a key feature. Backpropagation also highlighted collagen waviness and fatty tissue. Forward-forward emphasized collagen density. We integrated these complementary insights, validated by significance analysis, into a standardized attention metric, allowing a multi-structural, quantitative assessment of tissue changes and highlighting areas for further clinical analysis. Our workflow, using clinically routine biopsies and transparent diagnostic features, demonstrates the unique potential of forward-forward in providing novel, reliable, interpretable results from biomedical images. This paves the way for its dual use with backpropagation, shifting benchmarks by enabling the discovery of features potentially overlooked by backpropagation across biomedical datasets."

However, large-scale studies with longitudinal follow-up in this regard are yet to be conducted in the Indian subcontinent. Verbal, performance, and FSIQ of children with dystrophinopathy, aged 6-16 years were prospectively compared with age/socioeconomic status matched healthy controls, using the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian children (MISIC). Additionally, cognitive assessments were repeated in dystrophinopathy boys who completed at least one year of follow-up during study period. Genotype-phenotype correlation was also explored between FSIQ and mutational characteristics by dividing the dystrophinopathy group into Dp427, Dp140, and Dp71 isoforms. Furthermore, other clinical/genetic predictors of cognitive status were explored in dystrophinopathy cases. A total of 154 and 77 boys were enrolled in the dystrophinopathy and control groups, respectively. While the dystrophinopathy group had lower scores in verbal, performance, FSIQ, and all sub-tests compared to the control group (p < 0.001), their performance IQ was paradoxically better than verbal IQ (86.9 ± 12.3 vs 83.6 ± 11.4, p = 0.008). The Dp71 group had significantly lower verbal, performance, and FSIQ, and this isoform was found to be an independent predictor of intellectual disability in the dystrophinopathy group in multivariate analysis. Follow-up IQ assessment after one year (n = 47) showed a non-significant reduction in FSIQ (85.1 ± 10.7 vs 84.3 ± 11.2, p = 0.64). Boys with dystrophinopathy exhibit lower IQ compared to healthy controls, and the degree of cognitive impairment is more pronounced in cases with the Dp71 isoform."

These models closely mimic human DMD pathology and motor dysfunction, making them suitable for testing gene therapies. Using these models, we develop a single-cut gene therapy strategy that can be directly applied to humans. This treatment restores dystrophin expression, improves pathological features, and enhances motor abilities in DMD monkeys, with effects lasting at least 1.5 years. In conclusion, we achieve the rapid generation of DMD monkey models and demonstrate that our gene therapy approach is effective and holds significant potential for clinical application."

Exon-skipping therapy is among the most promising approaches for treating DMD, with several antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) already approved by the FDA; however, their limited efficacy highlights substantial potential for further improvement. In this study, we evaluate the potential of combining ASO with valproic acid (VPA) to enhance dystrophin expression and improve functional outcomes in a murine model of DMD. Our results indicate that the ASO+VPA treatment significantly increases dystrophin restoration across various muscle tissues, with particularly pronounced effects observed in cardiac muscle, where levels are nearly doubled compared to ASO monotherapy. Additionally, we demonstrate significant improvements in functional outcomes in treated <i>mdx</i> mice. Our findings suggest that the combined ASO+VPA therapy holds promise as an effective therapeutic approach to ameliorate muscle function in DMD, warranting further exploration of its mechanistic pathways and long-term benefits."

    "abstract": "Dystrophin is a <i>DMD</i> coding protein that serves as a connector maintaining the structural formation and functional hemostasis of myofilaments, which regulate the contraction of cardiomyocytes. However, early-onset heart failure or cardiomyopathy is closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)-affected patients. Pathogenicity screening and identification of the potential combined variants are thus critical for the management of such patients. Herein, we report a rare case of a patient with early-onset DMD attributed to a compound genetic variant in the <i>DMD</i> and <i>TNNI3K</i> genes. The proband, a 15-month-old male patient, presented with severe heart failure, enlarged ventricles, and diffuse fibrosis. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify a compound missense variant as c.1540G>T (p.V514L) of the <i>DMD</i> gene and c.1633G>T of the <i>TNNI3K</i> gene, resulting in disease. The protein structures of the mutant dystrophin and TNNI3K were built using AlphaFold3. The amino acid residues around site 514 had changed in DMD p.V514L, and the altered surrounding structures resulted in protein dysfunction. Furthermore, the amino acid residues around site 545 had changed in TNNI3K p.G545C, causing significant alterations to the hydrogen bonding. As both of these mutations contribute to regulating the myofilaments, potential interactions are suspected. Then, the binding structure was established using AlphaFold3, and the structural changes were identified based on the compound variants. We present a rare case of a compound genetic variant that induces severe and very-early-onset heart failure in DMD patients. The compound variant attenuates the interactions between <i>DMD</i> and <i>TNNI3K</i>, leading to functional collapse of the myofilaments. This finding emphasizes the importance of comprehensive genetic analysis in DMD patients. Identification of additional variants can significantly aggravate the pathological process and disease prognosis, and such patients always require swift and careful clinical management to obtain desirable outcomes."

Our previous study showed no differences in left ventricular function between perindopril-bisoprolol and matched placebo after 36 months. This study aimed to determine whether heart measures diverged after 60-month total follow-up. All participants had commenced open-label perindopril and bisoprolol when the original study ended. All were reconsented for access to heart measures, undertaken as part of their clinical care. The primary outcome was the change in echo-measured ventricular ejection fraction from baseline according to original randomization. Of 75 participants reported originally, 65 (aged 16 ± 2.5 years) were re-recruited and had data for analysis. Adjusted primary outcomes included 44 participants (original arms: 'active' 21; 'placebo' 23), 48 for secondary outcomes, and 65 for 'headcount' analysis of those with ventricular dysfunction. Absolute LVEF% values reduced in both groups ('active': 62.5% ± 5.6% to 53.8% ± 4.0%; 'placebo': 60.6% ± 4.9% to 50.4% ± 8.5%). Despite trends favoring earlier introduction of therapy, change from baseline was similar between groups (adjusted mean difference: -7.7 (95% CI -16.4 to1.0%)). However, more in the 'placebo' arm had died, had reduced LVEF%, and were taking additional heart medications. While some patients may have benefited from 'early' (active) as opposed to 'delayed' (placebo) initiation of perindopril and bisoprolol, group-mean ventricular function did not differ between study arms after 60 months. Small numbers, absence of a control group, insensitivity of echo-ejection fraction, and additional drug use probably prevented divergence between groups."

However, its clinical application has been limited partly due to the time-intensive process of manual segmentation. We present a simple and fast automated approach to obtain quantitative measurement of thigh muscle fat fraction and investigate its reliability in patients with DMD. Clinical and radiological baseline and 6-month follow-up data of 41 ambulant patients with DMD were analysed retrospectively. Axial 2-point Dixon MR images of all thigh muscles were used to quantify mean fat fraction, while clinical outcomes were measured by the Motor Function Measure (MFM) and its D1 domain. Data obtained by automated segmentation were compared to manual segmentation and correlated with clinical outcomes. Results were also used to compare the statistical power when using automated or manual segmentation. A mean increase of 3.55% in thigh muscle fat fraction at 6-month follow-up could be detected by both methods without any significant difference between them (p=0.437). The automated muscle segmentation method demonstrated a strong correlation with manually segmented data (Pearson's ρ = 0.97). Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between the automated and manual segmentation methods in their association with clinical progression, as measured by the total MFM score and its D1 domain (p = 0.235 and p = 0.425, respectively). The presented automated segmentation technique is a fast and reliable tool for assessing disease progression, particularly in the early stages of DMD. It is one of the few studies validated using manual segmentation, and with further refinement, it has the potential to become a good surrogate marker for disease progression in various neuromuscular disorders."

Given the critical role of skeletal muscle atrophy in chronic conditions such as neuromuscular, metabolic, and cardiopulmonary disorders, SA represents a promising preclinical tool to study muscle hypertrophy mechanisms in pathological states. However, although extensively characterized in healthy animals, the potential applications of SA in disease models remain largely overlooked. This Mini-Review summarizes existing studies employing SA in rodent disease models, highlighting the diverse hypertrophic responses observed across conditions, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, obesity, diabetes, cancer cachexia, and chronic kidney disease. Although hypertrophy gains are generally attenuated in diseased animals compared to healthy controls, SA-induced overload provides valuable insights into disease-specific regulatory mechanisms, including alterations in intracellular signaling, fiber type transitions, and disease phenotype. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of SA as a preclinical model for resistance training in disease contexts and propose its broader adoption for mechanistic investigations into skeletal muscle plasticity under pathological conditions."

This study aims to develop a classification model using radiomic features from MRI T2-weighted Dixon sequences to increase the accuracy of distinguishing DMD and BMD in the early disease stage. We retrospectively analysed MRI data from 62 patients aged 36-60 months with muscular dystrophy, including 41 with DMD and 21 with BMD. Radiomic features were extracted from in-phase, opposed-phase, water, fat, and postprocessed fat fraction images. We employed a deep learning segmentation method to segment regions of interest automatically. Feature selection included the Mann‒Whitney U test for identifying significant features, Pearson correlation analysis to remove collinear features, and the LASSO regression method to select features with nonzero coefficients. These selected features were then used in various machine learning algorithms to construct the classification model, and their diagnostic performance was compared. Our proposed radiomic and machine learning methods effectively distinguished early DMD and BMD. The machine learning models significantly outperformed the radiologists in terms of accuracy (81.2-90.6% compared with 69.4%), specificity (71.0-86.0% compared with 19.0%), and F1 score (85.2-92.6% compared with 80.5%), while maintaining relatively high sensitivity (85.6-95.0% compared with 95.1%).

Mouse cardiosphere-derived cells (mCDCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by human cardiosphere-deriveds (hCDC-EVs) are therapeutic to mice with advanced-stage DMD. Here, we investigated the long-term benefits of monthly dosing when initiated early. At the endpoint, exercise performance and skeletal muscle function were strikingly preserved in mdx mice that had received mCDCs, but not in vehicle control. In contrast, the beneficial effects of hCDC-EVs waned after 6 months, in parallel with the development of anti-hCDC-EV antibodies. Further investigation showed that mCDCs lowered fibrosis and initiated a myogenic response program in mdx skeletal muscle. Thus, early and sustained intervention with mCDCs prevents disease progression for up to 1 year in mdx mice. This discovery offers new insights into how cell therapy can be used to treat DMD and motivates clinical testing of CDCs beginning in newly diagnosed DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Loss of full-length dystrophins is both necessary and sufficient to initiate DMD. These isoforms are expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex (Dp427c), and cerebellar Purkinje cells (Dp427p). However, our understanding of the consequences of their absence, which is crucial for developing targeted interventions, remains inadequate. We combined RNA sequencing with genome-scale metabolic modelling (GSMM), immunodetection, and mitochondrial assays to investigate dystrophic alterations in the brains of the mdx mouse model of DMD. The cerebra and cerebella were analysed separately to discern the roles of Dp427c and Dp427p, respectively. Investigating these regions at 10 days (10d) and 10 weeks (10w) followed the evolution of abnormalities from development to early adulthood. These time points also encompass periods before onset and during muscle inflammation, enabling assessment of the potential damage caused by inflammatory mediators crossing the dystrophic blood-brain barrier. For the first time, we demonstrated that transcriptomic and functional dystrophic alterations are unique to the cerebra and cerebella and vary substantially between 10d and 10w. The common anomalies involved altered numbers of retained introns and spliced exons across mdx transcripts, corresponding with alterations in the mRNA processing pathways. Abnormalities in the cerebra were significantly more pronounced in younger mice. The top enriched pathways included those related to metabolism, mRNA processing, and neuronal development. GSMM indicated dysregulation of glucose metabolism, which corresponded with GLUT1 protein downregulation. The cerebellar dystrophic transcriptome, while significantly altered, showed an opposite trajectory to that of the cerebra, with few changes identified at 10 days. These late defects are specific and indicate an impact on the functional maturation of the cerebella that occurs postnatally. Although no classical neuroinflammation markers or microglial activation were detected at 10 weeks, specific differences indicate that inflammation impacts DMD brains. Importantly, some dystrophic alterations occur late and may therefore be amenable to therapeutic intervention, offering potential avenues for mitigating DMD-related neuropsychiatric defects."

This study aims to quantify muscle volume and fat fraction in muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the masticatory muscles in non-ambulant DMD patients compared to healthy controls and evaluate their correlation with maximum bite force (MBF), which has not been previously described. Fifteen patients with DMD and 16 controls were included. MBF was measured with an oral dynamometer and total muscle volume (TMV) and fat signal fraction (FSF) were quantified using MRI with the Dixon technique. Four DMD patients presented with masticatory or swallowing difficulties. DMD patients had a significantly lower median MBF (141.8 N) compared with healthy controls (481.6 N, p < 0.0001). Additionally, median FSF was significantly higher in DMD patients (47.07 %) compared to controls (5.31 %, p < 0.0001). A strong negative correlation between TMV and MBF was observed in DMD patients (ρ = -0.70, p = 0.0048). A significant negative correlation between MBF and normalized FSF was observed in healthy controls (ρ = -0.5487, p = 0.300) and DMD patients (ρ = -0.5893, p = 0.0224). A non-significant positive correlation between age and FSF in DMD was detected (ρ = 0.38, p = 0.17). MBF, TMV and FSF quantified with the Dixon MRI are sensitive measures to evaluate masticatory function in DMD patients and may serve as biomarkers for clinical follow up.

While the interplay between the nature of the muscle injury and the specific genetic driver is poorly understood, the similarities exhibited by various NMDs suggest that a common proteomic signature of muscle injury may exist. We used an established exercise challenge and the SOMAscan proteomics platform to study the baseline and post-exercise proteomic profiles in a cross-sectional study of three different muscular dystrophies: Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy types R9 and R12. Our Results Uncover a Common Signature of Circulating Proteins That Are Elevated in all Three Myopathies, Some of Which Are Further Elevated by Exercise in Becker Muscular Dystrophy and Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type R9, and Others That Are Not Responsive to Exercise. Interestingly, these two signatures exhibit opposing trajectories with age in a larger cross-sectional cohort of BMD individuals. This research represents a first step toward defining an annotated protein signature coupled with activity-injury, a defining pathophysiological feature of many myopathies."

Other myopathy conditions, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, also affect the cardiac muscle and are associated with fibrosis and reduced cardiac function. To determine potential cardiac implications of wooden breast disease and identify whether molecular and fibrotic changes were similar to what we have previously found in the breast, we have investigated the hearts of commercial Ross 308 broilers. Hearts from male Ross 308 broiler chickens from mildly and severely wooden breast-affected chickens categorized in previous studies were analyzed. Ventricles from the hearts were analyzed by immunoblotting, real-time qPCR, near-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Masson`s trichrome histology. RNA sequencing was also conducted to identify the molecular footprint of the mildly and severely wooden breast-affected chickens. Compared to mildly affected chickens, the severely wooden breast-affected chickens did not show an increase in heart weight, water-binding capacity, or macronutrient composition. The hearts did also not display any differences in fibrosis development, extracellular matrix gene expression, or typical cardiac and inflammatory markers. The severely affected chickens did, however, show a reduction in protein levels of biglycan and fibromodulin, as well as alterations in matrix metalloproteinase 2, Wnt ligands, mTOR signaling, heat shock protein 70, and muscle LIM protein. Functional enrichment analysis of RNA sequencing also suggested a different molecular footprint of biological processes and pathways between the two groups. Hearts from wooden breast-affected chickens did not display the same fibrotic alterations as those previously found in the breast. Despite few alterations detected in the markers and signaling molecules tested, RNA sequencing indicated a different molecular footprint in the hearts of severely compared to mildly wooden breast-affected chickens."

The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of selected TA features in the LGE assessment of DMD patients. We developed a pipeline to extract TA features of native T1 parametric mapping and evaluated their prognostic value in assessing LGE in DMD patients. For this evaluation, five independent TA features were selected using Boruta to identify relevant features based on their importance, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to reduce the number of features, and hierarchical clustering to target multicollinearity and identify independent features. Afterward, logistic regression was used to determine the features with better discrimination ability. The independent feature inverse difference moment normalized (IDMN), which measures the pixel values homogeneity in the myocardium, achieved the highest accuracy in classifying LGE (0.857 (0.572-0.982)) and also was significantly associated with changes in the likelihood of LGE in a subgroup of patients with three yearly examinations (estimate: 23.35 (8.7), p-value = 0.008). Data are presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR) for normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables and numbers (percentages) for categorical ones. Variables were compared with the Welch t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Chi-square tests. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. IDMN leverages the information native T1 parametric mapping provides, as it can detect changes in the pixel values of LGE images of DMD patients that may reflect myocardial alterations, serving as a supporting tool to reduce GBCA use in their cardiac MRI examinations."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the variations in dual-task performance between children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and their typically developed peers. Simultaneously, we explored the impact of psychosocial features and functional parameters on dual-task performance in children with DMD. A total of 45 children with DMD and 49 typically developed peers were included in the study. After recording the demographic information of the children, the motor-motor and cognitive-motor dual-task performances of all children were assessed by adding motor (carrying a half-filled bottle of water in both hands) and cognitive tasks (mental practice and memory) to the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT). Then Brooke Lower Extremity Functional Classification (BLEFC), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), Gait Assessment Scale for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD-GAS), Four Square Step Test (FSST), Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)-Neuromuscular Module, and Pediatric Fear of Falling Questionnaire (Ped-FOF) were assessed for motor performance, ambulation levels, walking abilities, balance, cognitive levels, quality of life, and fear of falling, respectively. In our study, a significant difference was found between the dual-task performances of children with DMD and their typically developed peers, with typically developed children performing better in motor-motor, cognitive motor/mental, and cognitive motor/memory tasks (p < 0.001). Relationships were identified between the dual-task performances of DMD children and the 6MWT (r: -0.715; -0.651; -0.641; respectively), NSAA (r: -0.669; -0.434; -0.451; respectively) DMD-GAS (r: -0.626; -0.409; -0.424; respectively), FSST (r: 0.747; 0.534; 0.503; respectively), PedsQL-Neuromuscular Module (parent report) (r: -0.432; -0.340; -0.357; respectively), and Ped-FOF (r: 0.512; 0.449; 0.436; respectively), (p < 0.05). Our study indicated that dual-task performance in children with DMD is lower than that of their peers, and it is related to the children's motor skills, ambulation levels, and psychosocial features. These findings suggest that incorporating assessments and approaches for dual-task performance into rehabilitation programs aimed at preserving or improving motor functions, ambulation levels, and quality of life may be important for a holistic approach to managing the disease."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by loss-of-function mutations to the gene encoding dystrophin. Restoring the reading frame of dystrophin by removing internal out-of-frame exons may address symptoms of DMD. Therefore, the principle of exon skipping has been at the center stage in drug development for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) over the past two decades. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) have proven effective in modulating splicing sites for exon skipping, resulting in the FDA approval of several drugs using this technique in recent years. However, due to the temporary nature of AON, researchers are actively exploring genome editing as a potential long-term, single-administration treatment. The advancements in genome-editing technology over the last decade have boosted this transition. While no clinical trials for exon skipping in DMD via genome editing have been conducted as of this writing, preclinical studies show encouraging results. This review describes the preclinical landscape of genome editing for exon skipping in DMD treatment. Along with highlighting the adaptability of genome editing in exon skipping, this review also describes delivery challenges and outlines future research directions that could set a new stage for enhanced therapeutic development in DMD."

The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) are used to measure motor performance in ambulatory and non-ambulatory individuals, respectively. There is limited published qualitative evidence on what constitutes a meaningful change on either instrument. The aim of this study is to understand meaningful change in functional abilities as measured by the NSAA and PUL at different ability levels from the perspective of individuals with DMD, caregivers of individuals with DMD, and clinicians. The study utilized a non-interventional, descriptive, cross-sectional qualitative design consisting of 69 semi-structured interviews, including individuals with DMD (<i>n</i> = 18), caregivers of individuals with DMD (<i>n</i> = 51), and neuromuscular physiotherapists (<i>n</i> = 2) to understand meaningful change on the NSAA and PUL. The results for both instruments indicated that: (i) items that are meaningful differ based on ability level; (ii) maintaining function in lower and upper limbs is the ultimate goal; (iii) meaningful change is often reported in relation to gain or loss of specific function, as opposed to number of total points on the scale; and (iv) losing one scale point corresponds to either a partial or full loss in function and activity, which has differing impacts on daily life. The perception of meaningful change in DMD as measured by the NSAA is influenced by ability levels and ambulatory function, with participants describing their need to maximize certain abilities, maintain function, and retain independence. For the PUL, participants underscored the importance of maintenance of their functional abilities, and highlighted key themes related to maintaining independence in ADLs, reaching, eating/drinking, and finger function for technology use across score categories."

In this article, we present the diagnosis and treatment process of a case exhibiting dysmorphic facial features, signs of adrenal insufficiency, pseudo-hypertriglyceridemia, and elevated creatine phosphokinase levels. The patient's serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels were normal, and the adrenal glands were not observable via magnetic resonance imaging. An Xp21.2 deletion (<i>DMD, NR0B1, GK, IL1RAPL1</i>) was identified in the case. The treatments of hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone, and oral salt have been arranged.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are neuromuscular diseases that lead to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Recent therapeutic advances for DMD and SMA highlight the need for accurate clinical evaluation. Traditionally, motor function of the upper limbs is assessed using motor function scales. However, these scales are influenced by clinician's interpretation and may lack accuracy. For this reason, clinicians are becoming interested in finding alternative solutions. In this context, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) have gained popularity, offering the possibility to quantitatively and objectively analyze motor function of patients to support clinicians' assessments. We analyzed upper limb kinematics of two groups of children with neuromuscular diseases, seventeen DMD patients and fifteen SMA patients, while performing the corresponding clinical assessment. These two groups were further subdivided into two categories (Category A and Category B), according to disease severity (Brooke scores <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>≤</mo> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </math> and Brooke scores <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mn>2</mn></mrow> </math> , respectively). The results were compared against a group of ten healthy children. The metrics showing the strongest correlation with the clinical score were the workspace area in the frontal and transverse plane (DMD: <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ρ</mi></math> = 0.94 and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ρ</mi></math> = 0.90; SMA: <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ρ</mi></math> = 0.78 and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ρ</mi></math> = 0.81) and the workspace volume (DMD: <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ρ</mi></math> = 0.92; SMA <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ρ</mi></math> = 0.81). Additionally, statistically significant differences were found not only between healthy children and those with neuromuscular disease, but also across severity levels within the patient group. These results represent a first step toward validating IMU-based systems to helping clinicians to accurately quantify the motor status of children with neuromuscular diseases. Furthermore, data collected with inertial sensors can provide clinicians with additional information not available through subjective observation."

To establish longitudinal trajectories for a comprehensive integrated set of muscle impairments, including muscle weakness, contractures and muscle size alterations, while correcting for normal maturation, in DMD. Thirty-three boys with DMD (aged 4.3-17 years) were included. Fixed dynamometry, goniometry, and 3D freehand ultrasound were used to repeatedly assess lower limb muscle strength, passive range of motion (ROM) and muscle size, resulting in 161, 178 and 64 assessments for the strength, ROM and ultrasound dataset, respectively. To account for natural strength development, ROM reduction, and muscle growth in growing children, muscle outcomes were converted to unit-less z-scores calculated in reference to typically developing (TD) peers. This allows the interpretation of the muscle outcomes as deficits or alterations with respect to TD. Mixed-effect models estimated the longitudinal change in muscle impairments. At 4.3-4.9 years of age, all muscle strength outcomes and several ROMs (i.e., dorsiflexion, hamstrings, and hip extension) showed deficits relative to TD, while m. medial gastrocnemius size was increased. Most muscle outcomes remained stable or slightly improved until the ages of 6.6-9.4 years (except knee flexion strength). After this period, muscle strength (-0.27 to -0.45 z-score/year; p < 0.0044), dorsiflexion ROM (-0.23 to -0.33 z-score/year; p < 0.0007), m. medial gastrocnemius size (-0.56 z-score/year; p = 0.0022), and m. rectus femoris size (-0.36 z-score/year; p = 0.0054) declined. The current study established longitudinal trajectories of muscle impairments in boys with DMD. The results provided enriched history data and revealed promising outcome measures that could enhance the detection of the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies. Future studies are necessary to validate these outcomes."

    "abstract": "Inefficient transduction is a major limitation in achieving therapeutic levels of AAV-delivered microdystrophin capable of improving muscle function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Additionally, some patients experience acute complications due to activation of innate immune pathways, such as complement. We propose that inhibiting complement receptor 1/2/3 (CR 1/2/3)-mediated phagocytosis and endosomal TLR 7/8/9 signaling pathways may decrease immune and inflammatory responses while simultaneously increasing the availability of AAV virus for muscle transduction. <i>Mdx</i> mice were randomly assigned to the following three experimental conditions (n=8-9/group): Group 1, <i>mdx</i> untreated; Group 2, <i>mdx</i> + rAAV9-microdystrophin; Group 3, <i>mdx</i> + rAAV9-microdystrophin + semiweekly dosing of TLR 7/8/9 antagonist + complement receptor antibodies (combination therapy). The rAAV9-microdystrophin was administered twice to 6- and 12-week-old mice. A separate group of 6-week-old mice received a single rAAV9-microdystrophin dose and no other treatment (Group 4). We assessed several immune and inflammatory responses and dystrophin expression in the muscle. Viral load was significantly increased by 77-fold in white blood cells after two rAAV9-microdystrophin doses compared to mice receiving a single dose. Repeated gene therapy resulted in a lower viral load and microdystrophin expression in muscle compared to a single rAAV dose. 63% of mice treated with two rAAV9-microdystrophin doses produced antibodies to dystrophin, which was less in mice treated with two rAAV9-microdystrophin doses and combination therapy (25%). Likewise, AAV capsid specific antibody levels were reduced in mice receiving combination therapy. Microdystrophin expression in skeletal muscle evaluated by mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting showed significantly higher levels in combination-treated mice compared to rAAV9-microdystrophin alone. Our results demonstrate that combination treatment with complement receptor 1/2/3 antibodies and a TLR 7/8/9 antagonist enhances rAAV9-microdystrophin gene therapy in <i>mdx</i> mice by partially reducing inflammatory and immune responses and increasing microdystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, repeated gene therapy is associated with greater uptake by white blood cells and less microdystrophin expression in the skeletal muscle. This suggests that blocking complement receptors and/or TLR 7/8/9 pathways would be a promising strategy to enhance AAV-microdystrophin therapy."

    "abstract": "Muscle size and muscle strength gradually increase during childhood to meet the demands of a growing body. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to establish anthropometric-related percentile curves for muscle size and strength in a cohort of typically developing (TD) children. Lower limb muscle size and strength were assessed in a large cross-sectional cohort of TD children with 3D freehand ultrasound (four muscles, n = 153 children with in total 156 measurements, male/female = 85/71, age range: 0.6-17.8 years) and fixed dynamometry (seven muscle groups, n = 153 children, male/female = 108/45, age range: 4.5-16.1 years), respectively. Generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape were used to estimate anthropometric-related, that is, body mass and height, TD percentile curves, and to convert absolute outcomes into unit-less z-scores. The results showed that both muscle size and strength, as well as their inter-subject variation, increased with increasing anthropometric values. The mean z-score of the TD children was approximately 0 ± 1 standard deviation (with the largest range from minimum to maximum of approximately -3 to 3) for all investigated muscle outcomes, confirming the fit of the percentile curves to the TD data. The use of the percentile curves was demonstrated through applications in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The individual patients with CP and DMD exhibited negative z-scores, indicating muscle size and strength deficits in reference to TD peers. The established anthropometric-related percentile curves for muscle size and strength in a cohort of TD children allow for muscle outcomes to be expressed as unit-less z-scores, independent of body size, and relative to TD peers. This approach facilitates the interpretation of muscle size and strength outcomes, enabling the detection of abnormalities or deficits, monitoring of progression, and evaluation of treatment and intervention effectiveness in TD children, as well as in children with genetic, chronic neurological, or muscular disorders."

BMD severity varies from asymptomatic to severe, associated with the genotype of DMD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We established BMD mice carrying three representative exon deletions: ex45-48 del., ex45-47 del., and ex45-49 del. (d45-48, d45-47, and d45-49), with high frequencies and different severities in the human BMD hotspot. All three BMD mice showed muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, and fibrosis, but these changes appeared at different times for each exon deletion, consistent with the severities obtained by the natural history study of BMD. BMD mice showed site-specific muscle changes, unlike <i>mdx</i> mice, which showed diffuse muscle changes, and we demonstrated selective type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice. Furthermore, BMD mice showed sarcolemmal neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) reduction and morphological capillary changes around type IIa fibers. These results suggest that capillary changes caused by nNOS reduction may be associated with the mechanism of skeletal muscle degeneration and type IIa fiber reduction in BMD mice.

Therefore, the retention of the entrapped gas is an important condition in bubble formulations, especially for MBs and NBs with lipid shells, and the stability of the lipid membrane is considered to be affected. We previously developed NBs, which are polyethylene glycol-modified liposomes entrapping an ultrasound contrast gas that can serve as nucleic acid carriers and ultrasound contrast agents. In particular, NBs containing cationic lipids were useful as systemic delivery tools that can load genes and nucleic acids on their surfaces. However, the gas retention of NBs containing cationic lipids were low, leaving room for improvement as ultrasound contrast agents. In this study, we attempted to prepare NBs containing anionic lipids to improve their stability in vivo, and found that they lasted longer in contrast time than previous NBs. In order to utilize anionic NBs, we evaluated their usefulness as systemic delivery tools for cationic-peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO). PMO has attracted attention as a therapeutic agent for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); however, its charge neutrality makes its delivery into muscle fibers challenging, especially more difficult to apply PMO to myocardial damage. We examined the systemic delivery of PMO to the heart using a combination of anionic NBs and ultrasound. Furthermore, we evaluated the usability of octaarginine (R8), a cationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), in loading PMO onto the surface of NBs and verified the potential of PMO-loaded NBs as a therapy for cardiac dysfunction in muscular dystrophy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe muscle disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the intracellular protein dystrophin, is associated with impaired cardiac function and arrhythmias. A causative factor for complications in the dystrophic heart is abnormal calcium (Ca) handling in ventricular cardiomyocytes, and restoration of normal Ca homeostasis has emerged as therapeutic strategy. Here, we used a rodent model of DMD, the dystrophin-deficient DMD<sup>mdx</sup> rat, to test the following hypothesis: chronic administration of ivabradine (IVA), a drug clinically approved for the treatment of heart failure, improves Ca handling in dystrophic ventricular cardiomyocytes and thereby enhances contractile performance in the dystrophic heart. Intracellular Ca measurements revealed that 4-months administration of IVA to DMD<sup>mdx</sup> rats significantly improves Ca handling properties in dystrophic ventricular cardiomyocytes. In particular, IVA treatment increased electrically-evoked Ca transients and speeded their decay. This suggested enhanced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release and faster removal of Ca from the cytosol. Chronic IVA administration also enhanced the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a significant improvement of cardiac systolic function in IVA-treated DMD<sup>mdx</sup> rats. Thus, left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening were enhanced, and end-systolic as well as end-diastolic diameters were diminished by the drug. Finally, chronic IVA administration neither significantly attenuated cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis, nor was vascular function improved by the drug. Collectively our findings suggest that long-term IVA administration enhances contractile function in the dystrophic heart by improvement of Ca handling in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Chronic IVA administration may be beneficial for DMD patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare and severe genetic neuromuscular disease, characterized by rapid progression and high mortality, highlighting the need for accurate ambulatory function assessment tools. Ultrasound imaging methods have been widely used for quantitative analysis. Radiomics, which converts medical images into data, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising solution. This study is aimed at utilizing radiomics to analyze different stages of data generated during B-mode image processing to evaluate the ambulatory function of DMD patients. The study included 85 participants, categorized into ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups based on their functional status. Ultrasound scans were utilized to capture backscattered radiofrequency data, which were then processed to generate envelope, normalized, and B-mode images. Radiomics analysis involved the manual segmentation of grayscale images and automatic feature extraction using specialized software, followed by feature selection using the maximal relevance and minimal redundancy method. The selected features were input into five ML algorithms, with model evaluation conducted via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To ensure robustness, both leave-one-out cross-validation and repeated data splitting methods were employed. Additionally, multiple ML models were constructed and tested to assess their performance. The intensity values across all image types increased as walking ability declined, with significant differences observed between the ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups (p < 0.001). These groups exhibited similar diagnostic performance levels, with AUROC values below 0.8. However, radiofrequency (RF) images outperformed other types when radiomics was applied, notably achieving an AUROC value of 0.906. Additionally, combining multiple ML algorithms yielded a higher AUROC value of 0.912 using RF images as input. Radiomics analysis of RF data surpasses conventional B-mode imaging and other ultrasound-derived images in evaluating ambulatory function in DMD. Moreover, integrating multiple machine learning models further enhances classification performance. The proposed method in this study offers a promising framework for improving the accuracy and reliability of clinical follow-up evaluations, supporting more effective management of DMD.

Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to <i>Dmd</i> mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids.

Linear mixed-effects model analysis suggested that ten cytokines/chemokines were significantly elevated in affected dogs, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Further, cytokine/chemokine elevation coincided with the onset of muscle disease. Importantly, only CCL2 showed consistent changes at all ages, with the most pronounced increase occurring between 3 and 9 months. To study the effects of sample storage and type, we compared fresh versus frozen, and serum versus plasma, samples from the same dog. Similar readings were often obtained in fresh and frozen sera. Although plasma readings were significantly lower for many cytokines/chemokines, this did not compromise the robustness of CCL2 as a biomarker. Our study establishes a baseline for using circulatory cytokines/chemokines as biomarkers in canine DMD studies."

To explore human translation, we conducted a case-control study on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) youth treated with chronic glucocorticoids (n=24) relative to healthy controls (n=13) to explore the association of PDGF-BB, VEGF, angiogenin concentration and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations as surrogates of POCs (CD14+/Stro-1-/CD105-), skeletal progenitor cells (SPCs: Stro-1+/CD105+/CD14-/CD45-), and endothelial/hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+/CD14-/Stro-1-/CD105-) and CE140b mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) to fracture. People with DMD (8-20 years), were stratified by prior and subsequent fractures relative to biospecimen collection. Healthy controls were age- and sex-matched. Differences between groups were assessed with one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's test, retrospective fractures by Kendall Tau correlation, and prospective fractures by bivariable and multivariable accelerated time failure models. Baseline characteristics between groups were similar, though people with DMD were shorter relative to healthy controls, and in the DMD groups, those with prior fractures had a longer duration of glucocorticoid therapy. We noted decreased PDGF-BB concentration and percentages of circulating POCs, SPCs, and CD34+ cells in people with DMD relative to healthy controls. Circulating CD34+ cell percentage positively correlated with PDGF-BB concentration, similar to murine models. Lower percentage of circulating SPCs and CD140b MFI was associated with increased number of retrospective fractures. After a mean follow-up of 2.23 yr, 79% of people with DMD sustained a subsequent fracture. Higher PDGF-BB concentration and percent of POC, SPCs, and CD34+ cells were associated with a longer time to next fracture. After controlling for covariates of fracture risk, increased percentage of CD34+ cells continued to be associated with prolonged time to fracture. Circulating CD34+ cells may thus be a potential biomarker to predict acute fracture risk in young people with DMD on chronic glucocorticoids."

    "title": "Expansion of Splice-Switching Therapy with Antisense Oligonucleotides.",
    "abstract": "Since 2016, splice-switching therapy, in which splicing is controlled by antisense oligonucleotides, has been applied in clinical practice for spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the former disease, this therapy induces exon inclusion, while, in the latter, it induces exon skipping, leading expression of functional proteins. Basic and clinical studies of splice-switching therapy for many monogenic diseases have now been conducted. The molecular mechanisms of splice-switching therapy include not only the induction of exon inclusion and skipping, but also the induction of pseudoexon skipping and suppression of splicing sites generated by mutations. In addition, therapies that alter protein function by regulating splicing are being investigated not only for monogenic diseases but also for non-monogenic ones such as cancer and immune-related disorders. It is expected that many of these basic studies will be translated into clinical applications. This review describes the current status of basic research and clinical applications of splice-switching therapy to promote the development of treatments for noncurable diseases."

    "abstract": "We conducted a scoping review and analyzed the medical literature on PubMed to assess any potential short-term and long-term benefits of pubertal induction in patients with DMD. We identified six articles from our research cumulatively reporting clinical data from 58 pediatric patients with DMD, of age between 12 and 17.7 years. All of them were on glucocorticoid therapy with variable duration and the longest follow-up of 11.7 years. In all patients, the induction protocol was successful (leading to appearance of secondary sexual characteristics); no secondary effects were reported by any analyzed studies. Three papers reported an objective improvement of patients' quality of life, while in four there was a benefit on the bone profile. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 5,000 live-born male children. Because of early and chronic exposure to glucocorticoids, used as standards of care, pubertal development may be variable. While some boys experience a normal pubertal growth spurt, others have testosterone levels below the normal range for age and require pubertal induction therapy to achieve an adequate testicular volume, development of secondary sexual characteristics, and peak bone mass. When and how to use pubertal induction therapy in pediatric patients with DMD is still object of controversy. The reported evidence of testosterone therapy in patients with DMD is still limited to small cohort sizes, which suggest efficacy and psychosocial benefits."

In a DMD mouse model, <i>mdx<sup>5cv</sup></i> mice, CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) deficiency diminishes Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> macrophage infiltration by blocking blood Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocyte recruitment.

    "abstract": "As new therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are entering the market, shared decision making (SDM) will become increasingly important. Therefore, this study aimed to understand (1) Belgian stakeholders' knowledge and perceptions of SDM in DMD treatment decision making, (2) the current state of SDM implementation in DMD in Belgium, examining the role of all involved parties, and (3) the barriers and facilitators for SDM in DMD in the Belgian context. In this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews with the multidisciplinary team (MDT) of individuals with DMD (n = 18) and caregivers thereof (n = 11) were conducted in Belgium. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically using the framework method. Most caregivers were unfamiliar with the term SDM, while MDT members were aware of it but struggled to define it consistent with existing literature. Despite acknowledging some drawbacks, participants valued SDM as an important process in DMD care, noting its presence in current practice. However, both MDT members and caregivers sometimes questioned the necessity of SDM due to limited treatment options available. Consequently, decision making predominantly relied on (child) neurologists sharing information and seeking consent from caregivers and individuals with DMD for a proposed treatment. Participants highlighted the important role of the MDT, with each professional contributing its unique expertise to SDM. To reduce existing barriers and enhance the SDM process, participants called for clear and transparent information regarding different treatment options, including clinical trials, and detailed information on how treatments might affect patients' daily life. This study identified an increased need for easily understandable information, particularly regarding DMD care in general, but also about clinical trials covering new and emerging therapies. Developing specific evidence-based tools could support stakeholders' understanding of this information, thereby enhancing implementation of the SDM process in DMD care. Further, as the treatment landscape of DMD evolves, it will become increasingly important for patients to be supported by an MDT, as they can provide information on clinical trials (e.g., study coordinators), emotional support (e.g., psychologists, nurses), and decisional guidance (e.g., neurologist)."

    "abstract": "Activation of endogenous full-length utrophin, a dystrophin homolog, presents an attractive therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), regardless of mutation types and loci. However, current dCas9-based activators are too large for efficient adeno-associated virus delivery, and the feasibility and durability of such treatments remain unclear. Here, we develop a muscle-targeted utrophin activation system using the compact dCasMINI-VPR system, termed MyoAAV-UA. Systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA in male mdx mice leads to substantial upregulation of utrophin at the sarcolemma, resulting in significant improvements in skeletal muscle function and a slowing of heart function deterioration. These benefits remain observable at six months post-treatment. In male nonhuman primates, systemic administration of MyoAAV-UA increases utrophin expression by twofold in skeletal muscle, with no significant side effects observed. Furthermore, MyoAAV-UA upregulates utrophin and utrophin-glycoprotein complexes in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes from DMD patients. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the potential of MyoAAV-UA as a therapeutic approach for DMD."

    "abstract": "Transplantation of human myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) is a promising therapeutic strategy for treating muscle-wasting diseases, e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To increase engraftment efficiency of donor stem cells, modulation of host muscles is required, significantly limiting their clinical translation. Here, we develop a clinically relevant transplantation strategy synergizing hydrogel-mediated delivery and engineered human MPCs generated from CRISPR-corrected DMD patient-derived pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that donor-derived human myofibers produce full-length dystrophin at 4 weeks and 5-6 months (long-term) after transplantation in the unmodulated muscles of the dystrophin-deficient mouse model of DMD. Remarkably, human myofibers are innervated by mouse motor neurons forming neuromuscular junctions and supported by vascularization after long-term engraftment in dystrophic mice. PAX7+ cells of human origin populate the satellite cell niche. There was no evidence of tumorigenesis in mice engrafted with hydrogel-encapsulated human MPCs. Our results provide a proof of concept in developing hydrogel-based cell therapy for muscle-wasting diseases."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to the absence of dystrophin and progressive muscle degeneration. Current therapeutic strategies, such as exon-skipping and gene therapy, face limitations including truncated dystrophin production and safety concerns. To address these issues, a novel mRNA-based therapy is explored using polyplex nanomicelles to deliver mRNA encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha isoform 4 (PGC-1α4) via hydrodynamic limb vein (HLV) administration. Using an in vivo muscle torque measurement technique, it is observed that nanomicelle-delivered Pgc-1α4 mRNA significantly improved muscle damage resistance and mitochondrial activity in mdx mice. Specifically, HLV administration of Pgc-1α4 mRNA in dystrophic muscles significantly relieved the torque reduction and myofiber injury induced by eccentric contraction (ECC), boosted metabolic gene expression, and enhanced muscle oxidative capacity. In comparison, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a widely used mRNA delivery system, does not achieve similar protective effects, likely due to their intrinsic immunogenicity. This foundational proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of mRNA-based therapeutics for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases such as DMD and demonstrates the capability of polyplex nanomicelles as a safe and efficient mRNA delivery system for therapeutic applications."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy are X-linked recessive disorders affecting muscle function, which are caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene (also known as the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene). The resulting condition is dictated by the severity of the involved mutation; for instance, Duchenne muscular dystrophy presents in early childhood with rapid progression, whereas Becker muscular dystrophy exhibits a milder, later onset with slower progression. In this report, we present the case of a young patient with clinical symptoms of a dystrophinopathy, whose genetic analysis yielded two previously undescribed mutations within the dystrophin gene. This paper focuses on a 12-year-old Syrian male patient with a 6-year history of progressive gait difficulty, lower limb weakness, and recurrent falls. Physical examination revealed a positive Gowers' sign and pseudohypertrophy, but normal muscle strength. A diagnosis of myopathy was supported by elevated serum creatine kinase and a muscle biopsy showing dystrophic changes in the right quadriceps muscle. While the initial deletion and duplication screening in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was negative, further extensive genetic analysis revealed two novel hemizygous variants of uncertain significance in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene (c.536A > T p.(Asp179Val) and c.680C > T p.(Ser227Phe), with no other clinically relevant variants in the neuromuscular panel. The identification of novel variants in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, alongside the absence of pathogenic mutations in other genes investigated by the neuromuscular panel, strongly suggests an X-linked dystrophinopathy diagnosis in our patient. This case highlights the need for continued exploration of dystrophinopathies' genetic variants. Further studies are required to elucidate the functional impact of these novel variants and to improve our understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic variability observed in these disorders, which may lead to a revolution in treatment approaches and potentially offer curative options for patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy are dystrophinopathies with a prevalence of 1:5000-6000 males, caused by pathogenic variants in DMD. These conditions are often accompanied by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) like autism (ASD; ~20%) and intellectual disability (ID; ~30%). However, their low penetrance in dystrophinopathies suggests additional contributing factors. In our study, 83 individuals with dystrophinopathies were clinically evaluated and categorized based on ASD (36 individuals), ID risk (12 individuals), or controls (35 individuals). Exome sequencing analysis revealed an enrichment of risk de novo variants (DNVs) in ASD-DMD individuals (adjusted p value = 0.0356), with the number of DNVs correlating with paternal age (p value = 0.0133). Additionally, DMD-ASD individuals showed a higher average of rare risk variants (RRVs) compared to DMD-Controls (adjusted p value = 0.0285). Gene ontology analysis revealed an enrichment of extracellular matrix-related genes, especially collagens, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome genes in ASD-DMD and DMD-ID groups. These findings support an oligogenic model for ASD in dystrophinopathies, highlighting the importance of investigating homogenized samples to elucidate ASD's genetic architecture."

Ten participants were purposively sampled and interviewed in-depth using semi-structured methods. Data was analyzed thematically. The reporting of this study was informed by the COREQ guidelines. The data revealed five themes: parental emotional reactions to learning about their child's diagnosis of DMD, parents as medical advocates for their child diagnosed with DMD, parental exhaustion from the day-to-day demands of caring for a child with a diagnosis of DMD, the DMD community as a lifeline for parents whose children have a diagnosis of DMD, barriers to adequate care for children with a diagnosis of DMD. This study offered multifaceted dimensions of parents' experiences with DMD, providing insights into the distinctive challenges, and coping strategies within the Turkish context. Parents encountered intricate and systemic challenges, and their ability to navigate these complexities varied depending on their support networks. Nurses can empower parents of children with DMD by addressing their emotional needs, educating them as medical advocates, and connecting them with community resources. Integrating these approaches into nursing practice ensures holistic, empathetic, and effective care, enhancing support and confidence for families navigating the challenges of DMD."

    "title": "The effect of IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab (Ilaris®) on IL-6 production in human skeletal muscle cells.",
    "abstract": "Muscle inflammation is one of the hallmarks of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle cells produce higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in response to toll-like receptor stimulation compared to normal muscle skeletal cells. IL- 1β induces the human skeletal muscle secretion of the myokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here, we evaluated the effect of a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody (canakinumab (Ilaris®)) that specifically blocks the IL-1β effect on IL-6 secretion by human skeletal muscle cells. Canakinumab is an excellent candidate for therapeutic repositioning to treat DMD because it is an FDA-approved drug to treat periodic fever syndromes and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Unlike previous generations of IL-1 inhibitors, canakinumab is highly specific for the IL-1β ligand, has a longer half-life, and does not interfere with other IL-1-activated inflammatory pathways. Following cell culture optimization and viability assays to assess toxicity, skeletal muscle cells were stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/mL) for 48 hours in the presence of nine concentrations of canakinumab ranging from 0.001 nM to 1000 nM, and IL-6 production was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pre-incubation of myoblasts with canakinumab before IL-1β-stimulation, significantly reduced IL-6 production at concentrations of 1, 10, 100, 250, and 1000 nM relative to controls, yielding an IC50 of 0.264 nM. On the other hand, co-incubation of canakinumab with IL-1β before addition to myoblasts resulted in a significant inhibition with the IC50 reducing to 0.126 nM, less than half of the previous method. Canakinumab also did not affect myotube viability at 10 nM and was also able to significantly reduce the production of IL-6, when the cells were stimulated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml). Taken together, our results show that canakinumab is a potent inhibitor of IL-1β signaling in muscle cells. These results align with previously published pre-clinical work with other IL-1 inhibitors in the mdx mouse model and support further investigation into the clinical utility of repositioning canakinumab to treat DMD."

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of fractures in hereditary NMD. We conducted a retrospective study in a cohort of adult patients with diverse hereditary NMD, using data from electronic medical records. Among 469 patients, 505 fractures were recorded, with 5.5% of patients experiencing a fracture within the past year. In the 10 years preceding study inclusion, 31.1% of all patients sustained at least one fracture. The fracture rate was 47.3/1000 patient-years. Fracture incidence was highest in the second decade of life and the first five years after symptom onset. Fracture recurrence occurred in 25.6% over the next two years. Fractures were most prevalent in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1/2, and spinal muscular atrophy. Patients with Vignos scale 5-6 had the highest fracture risk. Major osteoporotic fractures accounted for 28.6%, and 71.3% were caused by low-energy trauma. Long-term complications of a fracture were present in 44.2%, with 9.0% losing ambulation. Osteoporosis was confirmed in 47.5% of DXA scans. In patients with a normal DXA scan, 66.7% experienced a subsequent fracture. Hip T-scores declined with increasing Vignos scale (r = -0.27, p = 0.001). Fracture risk factors included glucocorticoid use, alcohol abuse, recent falls, and previous emergency visits for falls (all p < 0.05). This cohort exhibited a high prevalence of fractures and osteoporosis, emphasizing the need for regular bone health assessment and fracture prevention in hereditary NMD patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), the most common dystrophinopathies, require distinct treatments. Corticosteroids are effective for DMD but less so for BMD. Early diagnosis can improve DMD outcomes and prevent BMD overtreatment. However, differentiating them in younger children with mild symptoms is challenging due to overlapping features. To evaluate the performance of multi-parametric quantitative MRI (qMRI) in early differentiation between BMD and DMD, particularly among younger patients in the mild disease stage. Prospective. 121 DMD males (mean age 8.5 ± 1.6 years), 28 BMD males (9.7 ± 3.3 years), and 26 male healthy controls (HCs) (9.4 ± 2.7 years). 3.0T/3-point Dixon (fast-spin-echo), T1-mapping (modified-Look-Locker-inversion-recovery), and T2-mapping (balance-steady-state-free-precession). qMRI measurements (fat fraction [FF], T1, and T2) in 18 pelvic and thigh muscles were conducted. A linearized NorthStar ambulatory assessment (NSAA) score was used to evaluate the function status, with a mild functional decline stage defined as a score of 76-100. Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Receiver operating characteristic curves. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In all subject groups, DMD exhibits significantly higher FF and T2 and lower T1 compared to BMD. The max differences in mean FF, T1, and T2 was 45.29%, 543 ms, and 31.0 ms, respectively. Overall, the area under curve (AUC) values for FF surpassed those for T2 and T1 in the majority of muscles. In the mild subgroup below 10 years old, DMD had significantly higher FF and T1 than BMD. The combination of FF and T1 in gluteus medius, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus medialis, and adductor magnus achieved higher AUCs (0.816-0.957) than FF (0.773-0.862) or T1 (0.701-0.819) in differentiating the two subgroups.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting disease caused by a genetic mutation in the Dmd gene. Dystrophin mutant mice (mdx) have traditionally been used for DMD research as a disease model in the preclinical stage; however, mdx mice exhibit only very mild phenotypes to partially mimic muscle degeneration and regeneration. To overcome this limitation in preclinical studies, DMD mutant rats (DMD rats) generated by CRISPR/Cas were used as a DMD model to exhibit age-dependent progressive muscle degeneration and pathophysiological features similar to DMD patients and more severe than those displayed by mdx mice. TEI-SARM2 is a non-steroidal, orally available selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed as a pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of muscle wasting diseases based on its potent anabolic activity on skeletal muscle mass. In this study, long-term treatment of daily oral administration of TEI-SARM2 to DMD rats significantly improved muscle function (endurance and strength) assessed by grip and tetanic force measurements. TEI-SARM2 did not increase the muscle weight of hindlimbs in male DMD rats; moreover, long-term, weekly oral administration for 24 weeks improved muscle function with reduced side effects on the prostate and testes weight. Histological analysis showed that TEI-SARM2 significantly reduced adipose tissue infiltration in DMD muscle. In female DMD rats, both daily and weekly TEI-SARM2 treatment showed anabolic effects and enhanced muscle strength and endurance. Taken together, these results indicate that TEI-SARM2 has non-anabolic and anabolic effects that improve dystrophic muscle dysfunction and can be a supportive therapeutic option for DMD."

In approximately 10-20% of cases, they may present with muscle weakness and/or cardiomyopathy. We aimed to describe clinical and molecular characteristics of DMD heterozygous females. A monocentric, observational, and cross-sectional study was designed. Clinical and molecular data were collected along with, when available, muscle biopsies. The pattern of X inactivation was determined in peripheral blood and the genotypes at SPP1, LTBP4 and CD40 modifier genes were established. We recruited 47 participants: 27 (57%) were asymptomatic and 20 (43%) manifested symptoms. Proximal muscles were prominently involved, as in male dystrophinopathies. Twenty % of carriers showed cardiac involvement. Creatine kinase (CK) values were in the normal range in ~ 20% of symptomatic and ~ 46% asymptomatic patients. In all muscle biopsies, a mosaic of dystrophin positive and negative fibers was observed that only marginally correlated to dystrophin amount. No correlation was found between X chromosome inactivation pattern and the severity of muscular involvement, nor any association with cardiomyopathy. No genotype-phenotype correlations were identified. Genotype/phenotype correlations in females heterozygous for DMD mutations are influenced by multiple mechanisms, of which better understanding will be crucial for future dystrophin gene replacement therapies. An earlier molecular identification is essential to lead to greater awareness of the potential cardiac complications, and hence the reinforcement of appropriate cardiac follow-up."

    "abstract": "Pigs are extensively used for biomedical research as animal models given their similarities to humans including size, arterial capacity, and cutaneous structure. While their size also allows for the use of clinically available anesthesia equipment (for example, endotracheal tubes and ventilators), anecdotes exist with respect to stress reactions after exposure to volatile anesthetics. Over 3 mo at our institution, 11 pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) exposed to isoflurane anesthesia during 2 research protocols were euthanized after exhibiting clinical signs of malignant hyperthermia, including hyperthermia, hypercapnia, skeletal muscle rigidity, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. This group was composed of intact Yorkshire/Landrace crosses (68 to 91 kg) purchased from a research breeder. While malignant hyperthermia is caused by a mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1), another unnamed porcine stress syndrome is caused by a dystrophin defect. We analyzed the incidence of the RYR1 mutation and a dystrophin variant in 9 of the originally clinically affected pigs and in 56 subsequent pigs. All animals tested negative for the RYR1 mutation, while the dystrophin variant was found in 2 out of 7 clinical (28.6%) and 22 out of 46 (47.8%) subsequently tested female pigs. Creatine kinase, indicative of muscle damage, was slightly elevated at baseline in dystrophin variant-positive carriers, albeit not significantly. However, for the original clinically affected pigs, the increase in body temperature while under anesthesia was significantly greater in dystrophin variant-positive carriers (7.9 ± 0.8 °C) compared with noncarriers (5.2 ± 0.6 °C, P = 0.046). Taken together, we describe the suspected involvement of a dystrophin variant as one of the genetic etiologies in an unnamed condition that has been anecdotally experienced by pig researchers but not reported. We propose naming this condition volatile anesthesia porcine stress syndrome (VAPSS), which is an umbrella term that includes multiple genetic origins, the most well-known of which is malignant hyperthermia stress syndrome in pigs. Identifying other etiologies for VAPSS has implications for genetic and clinical screening to improve welfare in pigs bred for biomedical research and agricultural purposes."

Using an <i>in vitro</i> assay involving cationic lipids, we revealed that HDO technology increased the exon-skipping activity of LNA-based SSOs. To assess the effect of heteroduplex SSOs (HDSSOs) on exon-skipping activity, we designed and evaluated various HDSSOs using a series of complementary oligonucleotides with different sugar chemistries (DNA, RNA, and LNA), linkages (phosphodiester; PO and phosphorothioate; PS linkages), and lengths. HDO with different complementary oligonucleotide designs demonstrated a variety of exon-skipping activities. Next, we investigated the intracellular behavior of HDOs, which seemed to affect their efficient exon-skipping activity. We found that HDO technology increased the uptake of both SSOs and complementary oligonucleotides into the nuclei. Additionally, a series of complementary oligonucleotides showed different intracellular stabilities, and complementary oligonucleotide design appears to be one of the key factors affecting efficient exon skipping. Finally, we examined the exon-skipping activity of HDSSOs in <i>mdx</i> mice and found that HDSSOs exhibited higher exon-skipping activity than single-stranded LNA-based SSOs in these mice under intramuscular injections."

In this historical perspective we look back to the development paths of these two ASOs focusing on the differences between the approaches, the target tissues and the diseases. Based on this we propose learnings for future development of ASOs for progressive neuromuscular diseases."

    "title": "Physical training of wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders have symptoms related to the disease and complications to the sedentary lifestyle, such as constipation and lower back pain. Physical training might be beneficial. This systematic review investigates the potential benefits and harms of physical training for wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders. We systematically searched PubMed including studies published until July 2024. Inclusion criteria: 1) participants with a neuromuscular disorder, 2) at least 60% of participants in a study were wheelchair users, 3) physical training and its effects were investigated, 4) studies were prospective, and 5) English language was used. Non-peer-reviewed articles were excluded. Search results were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Two independent authors assessed the quality with the Downs and Black Quality Index. We included 14 studies of 140 patients from 5 types of neuromuscular disorders (Duchenne muscular atrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, limb-girdle muscular atrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). The mean quality was low (16/32) due to flaws in study design, selection bias, and power. Even though many were of low quality and lacked descriptions of adverse events, they all showed positive effects. Most studies investigated physical training of mastication or respiration with improvements in both. Other findings were improvements in endurance, extremity strength, and range of motion. Physical training of wheelchair users with neuromuscular disorders is not well investigated. Physical training seems safe and beneficial, but training of respiratory and masticatory muscles is the only well-documented exercise modality that can be advised in patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy/Spinal Muscular Atrophy, respectively. Larger, high-quality trials, including other neuromuscular disorders, are needed to assess the effects and adverse events of physical training."

    "title": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing as an integrative approach to explore physiological limitations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold-standard for quantification of peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) and cardiorespiratory and muscle responses to exercise. Its application to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has been scarce due to the notion that muscle weakness inherent to disease restricts the cardiorespiratory system from reaching maximal capacity. To investigate the utility of CPET in DMD by 1) establishing whether patients can perform maximal-effort exercise for valid VO<sub>2</sub> peak assessment; 2) quantifying VO<sub>2</sub> peak repeatability; 3) characterizing muscle and cardiorespiratory responses; 4) comparing VO<sub>2</sub> peak to 6-min walk distance (6MWD). Twenty-seven DMD and eight healthy boys (6 years and older) underwent CPET using an incremental work-rate protocol for leg (ambulatory) or arm (non-ambulatory) cycling with measurement of heart rate (HR) and gas-exchange variables from rest to maximal-effort. The oxygen cost of work (ΔVO<sub>2</sub>/Δwork-rate) was calculated, and peak exercise parameters (VO<sub>2</sub>, HR, O<sub>2</sub> pulse, ventilation (VE) and ventilatory threshold (VT)) were considered valid if the respiratory exchange ratio ≥1.01. VO<sub>2</sub> peak was valid (81.5% of patients), repeatable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.998) and low in ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD compared to controls (19.0 ± 6.0; 10.7 ± 2; 35.2 ± 4.5 mL/kg/min respectively). VT was low (30.8 ± 10.7; 19.4 ± 3.0; 61.2 ± 6.9% VO<sub>2</sub> peak) reflecting significant muscle metabolic impairment. Peak HR in ambulatory-DMD (172 ± 14 bpm) was similar to controls (183 ± 8.3 bpm), but O<sub>2</sub> pulse was low (3.4 ± 1.0; 6.5 ± 1.1 mL/beat). Peak VE/VO<sub>2</sub> (ambulatory = 42.1 ± 6.8; non-ambulatory = 42.2 ± 7.8; controls = 34.3 ± 4.6) and ΔVO<sub>2</sub>/Δwork-rate were elevated (ambulatory = 12.4 ± 4.9; non-ambulatory = 19.0 ± 9.7; controls = 10.1 ± 0.8) revealing ventilatory and mechanical inefficiency. Despite strong correlation between VO<sub>2</sub> peak and 6MWD, severity of impairment was discordant. Valid CPET is feasible in DMD, revealing low VO<sub>2</sub> peak due to abnormal muscle metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses during dynamic exercise. CPET reveals cardiorespiratory limitations in DMD boys with unremarkable 6MWD, and should be considered an integrative approach in clinical care and assessment of emerging therapeutics."

This study aims to; (1) exploring the desired participation for (young) adults with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); (2) exploration of the view and role of parents in this process; and (3) capturing the gap and the influencing factors between the current and desired situation. A cross-sectional digital survey was conducted, based on literature, expert opinion, and interviews with young adults with DMD and their parents. Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were used. 43 adults* with DMD an 30 parents completed the survey. All adults with DMD wanted to have an independent life. They were satisfied with their leisure activities. Gaps between the desired and current situation were identified concerning facilities and aids, social activities, and employment. Important factors of influence on these topics were accessibility, outdoor mobility, adequate care facilities, self-confidence, adequate knowledge of professionals and caregivers, and support of parents. The 30 participating parents saw limited opportunities in accessing facilities and aids, job opportunities, and their son having an intimate relationship. Adults with DMD desire a meaningful and independent life. The challenges they, and their parents face are mainly on social participation. More focus and collaboration is needed between health care services, social services and occupation environments to empower people with DMD living their desired adult life. *Adults; In this article, we use the term adults. By this we include boys aged 16 and 17."

    "title": "G-Quadruplex-Based Splice Switching as a Therapeutic Approach in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "RNA guanine (G)-quadruplexes (rG4) are unique noncanonical structures composed of stacked guanine quadruplexes that play diverse roles in regulating gene expression, from transcription to protein synthesis. This study proposes a new splice-switching therapy using G-quadruplex-inducing antisense oligonucleotides (G-ASOs) to reinstate dystrophin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) models. G-ASOs consist of two functionally independent domains that enable the formation of RNA/DNA hetero-G-quadruplex (hG4) structures. The antisense domain binds to complementary sequences within the target RNA, while the G-rich domain, which contains a sequence of continuous guanines (G-tract), interacts with the G-rich region of target RNA to form an hG4 structure. This precise binding forms an hG4 structure that effectively interrupts alternative splicing. In contrast to the traditional methods that block sterically, this technique employs steric hindrance by forming hG4 structures. Significantly, our findings show that hG4 structures can still form effectively even when the G-rich region of the target RNA and the antisense sequence are as much as 70 nucleotides apart. To address the challenges associated with G-quadruplex formation via G-ASO self-assembly, we developed bulge-containing G-ASOs. This enhancement improves both the efficiency of hG4 formation and the induction of exon-skipping therapy. In summary, this study highlights the potential of G-ASOs in gene therapy, specifically DMD, and marks significant progress in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. These findings highlight the effectiveness of G-ASOs in exon-skipping therapy and demonstrate the advancements in RNA structural manipulation."

    "abstract": "Safely achieving therapeutic expression levels with adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy is a significant challenge for treating the large muscle mass in humans. Non-human primates (NHPs) provide a more accurate assessment of the feasibility of achieving an effective and safe dose than rodents. Here, we compared a single systemic administration of AAV5, AAV8, or AAV9 in NHPs, each packaging the C5-12-microdystrophin-FLAG expression cassette. At 1 month post-dose, we compared tissue vector genomes, mRNA, and microdystrophin-FLAG protein levels by meso-scale discovery-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and immunofluorescence. The C5-12 promoter was highly selective for heart and skeletal muscles, when compared to off-target tissues such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lung, liver, and kidney. AAV8 led to higher levels of microdystrophin-FLAG mRNA and protein in the cardiac ventricles and skeletal muscles when compared to AAV5 or AAV9. The AAV8-microdystrophin-FLAG led to ∼20% of wild-type NHP dystrophin protein expression levels and was located on the sarcolemma of ∼40% of skeletal muscles fibers and ∼15% of left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Hematology, serum chemistry, and pathology were unremarkable. Thus, a systemic dose of ∼1.18 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes/kg AAV8 is predicted to be safe and efficacious for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but has significant room for improvement."

To investigate the genetic landscape of DMD using a two-tiered diagnostic approach combining MLPA and WES, and to correlate genetic findings with clinical outcomes for improved management. A cross-sectional study of 80 male DMD patients was conducted using a sequential genetic approach, combining MLPA and WES, with bioinformatics and statistical analyses to explore genotype-phenotype correlations. Pathogenic variants were identified in 65 cases (81.2 %), with deletions (67.5 %) being the most common, followed by duplications (6.3 %), splice-site (3.8 %), and nonsense variants (3.8 %). WES identified additional pathogenic variants in MLPA-negative cases, including novel mutations, expanding the known genetic spectrum of DMD. The combined MLPA-WES approach significantly improved diagnostic yield (χ² = 12.90, p < 0.001). Functional analysis revealed disruptions in glycogen metabolism (46 %), calcium transport (24 %), and mitochondrial function (12 %), with dystrophin-associated proteins (DAG1, SGCD) critically involved in muscle stability. Out-of-frame deletions were significantly associated with early disease onset (χ² = 49.03, p < 0.001) and severe phenotypes (χ² = 47.04, p < 0.001), supporting exon-skipping therapy. In-frame deletions correlated with milder progression, while nonsense variants posed a 2.5-fold increased risk of early cardiomyopathy (p = 0.002), emphasizing the need for early intervention. Combining MLPA and WES enhances DMD diagnostic accuracy, enabling timely clinical interventions. Integrating functional analysis with genotype-phenotype correlations supports personalized therapeutic strategies, improving patient outcomes."

Forty-five mice in three groups (n = 15 each): Group 1 (normal), Group 2 (mdx control), and Group 3 (mdx fed Neu REFIX) were evaluated for 45 days. IGF-1, Dystrophin, CD44 and MYH3 in diaphragm, plasma and skeletal muscle were evaluated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Mean IGF-1 expression was 20.32% and 16.27% higher in plasma (p = 0.03) and diaphragm respectively in Neu-REFIX group. Mean dystrophin was higher in Neu-REFIX group by 70.3% and 4.7% in diaphragm and plasma respectively than control. H-score intensity of CD44 + was > 2.0 with an MYH3-positivity 20% higher in Neu-REFIX than control. Oral administration of Neu REFIX was safe. Significantly enhanced plasma IGF-1 beside increased Dystrophin, MYH3 and CD44, proving a restoration of muscle regeneration and differentiation, especially in diaphragm, makes us recommend it as a disease modifying adjuvant in both early and advanced stages of DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by pathogenic variants of the <i>DMD</i> gene, leading to the loss of dystrophin. Clinical variability in DMD can complicate interpretation of interventional data in clinical trials. One source of clinical variability is allelic heterogeneity (different pathogenic variants with different effects on dystrophin protein expression). We sought to determine whether gene variant classes in clinical trial participants potentially affect clinical trial data interpretation. We analyzed 186 vamorolone trial participants with DMD (VBP15-002/003; VBP15-004) who were 4 to <7 years old and steroid-naïve at baseline. We stratified participants into gene variant classes by either variant location in the gene affecting different gene promoters (5' [Dp427-only] vs 3' [Dp427+other isoforms]) or residual dystrophin levels (null vs possible non-null [5' gene variants, exon 44 skippable, splice site]). We evaluated associations with baseline motor outcomes and treatment response (prednisone and vamorolone). Participants with variants in ex63 and downstream (null for Dp427+Dp140+Dp71 protein isoforms) showed poorer baseline motor outcomes for time to stand from supine velocity than those with variants in ex1-44 (Dp427 only). No significant baseline differences were found between likely null and possible non-null variants. Participants with only Dp427 involvement showed significantly better treatment response for the 6-minute walk distance. Most of the comparisons of baseline motor function and treatment response were similar between variant classes. The large variation in baseline motor function in young, steroid-naïve patients with DMD is only minimally explained by different gene variant classes. While there is strong literature support for 3' variants leading to a more severe motor and cognitive DMD phenotype, we found this variant class under-represented in our clinical trials. This suggests that they may fail inclusion criteria (failure to follow commands; poor motor function). Subgroup analyses in DMD clinical trials at a young age range based on gene variant class may not reveal significant differences and would be relatively noninformative."

Since 2014, more than 30 neurologic medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neurologic conditions. This study aims to characterize recent trends in annual costs and aggregate spending from 2012 to 2021 for new-to-market (NTM) medications for 9 neurologic conditions. We used the Merative MarketScan commercial and Medicare supplemental databases to observe patients seen by a neurologist with neurologic diseases with newly FDA-approved medications from 2014 to 2021: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Huntington disease (HD), myasthenia gravis (MG), migraine, orthostatic hypotension (OH), tardive dyskinesia (TD), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Patients were included if they had ≥1 disease-related prescription medication fill from 2012 to 2021. NTM (medications approved from 2014 to 2021) and older evidence-based guideline-supported medications were observed annually. Outcomes examined were annual and aggregate out-of-pocket (OOP) and total medication costs. We identified 2,687 unique individuals with ALS, 38 with ATTR, 69 with DMD, 884 with HD, 9,984 with MG, 441,099 with migraine, 4,723 with OH, 1,266 with TD, and 17 with SMA. The youngest population was DMD (mean = 25 years [SD = 7]), and the oldest was TD (mean = 66 years [SD = 14]). For DMD, the population was 99% male and for migraine, the population was 84% female, and the other conditions had more relatively even sex divides. Collectively, migraine medications had the largest increase in aggregate costs (1993%) and had a substantial increase in OOP costs on average by 234% ($86-$288). Eculizumab for MG was an extreme outlier, with OOP costs increasing by 4,099% ($413-$17,359) and aggregate OOP costs by 7,005% ($5,375-$381,894). OOP costs of edaravone ($304-$5,707) and deutetrabenazine ($670-$7,170) sharply increased by 1,775% and 971%, respectively. NTM medications for neurologic conditions have substantial and increasing individual and societal costs, which was not observed for older generic medications. These data suggest a need for policies to limit the financial burden of NTM medications on patients with neurologic conditions."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between muscle activity and cardiomyopathy. We hypothesised that cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle activity are directly related. Physical activity was assessed with accelerometers worn for 7 days. Average activity (vector magnitude/min) and percentage of time in different activities were reported. Cardiac MRI was used to assess left ventricular ejection fraction, global circumferential strain (Ecc), late gadolinium enhancement, and cardiac index. Associations were assessed between physical activity and cardiac variables using a Spearman correlation. Duchenne muscular dystrophy subjects (<i>n</i> = 46) with an average age of 13 ± 4 years had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 57 ± 8%. All physical activity measures showed significant correlations with left ventricular ejection fraction (rho = 0.38, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and left ventricular cardiac index (rho = 0.51, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Less active subjects had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (<i>p</i> = 0.10) and left ventricular cardiac index (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Non-ambulatory patients (<i>n</i> = 29) demonstrated a stronger association between physical activity and left ventricular ejection fraction (rho = 0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.03) while ambulatory patients demonstrated a stronger association between physical activity and left ventricular cardiac index (rho = 0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Ecc did not associate with physical activity in either cohort. Physical activity correlates with left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular cardiac index and is modified by ambulation. Future analysis should assess the temporal relationship between physical activity and cardiomyopathy."

Eteplirsen is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer and the first antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) approved for the treatment of patients with exon 51 skip-amenable DMD. This analysis presents the first population pharmacokinetics (PK) modeling and simulation performed for the ASO drug class in DMD. Study objectives were to characterize the population PK of eteplirsen in patients with DMD across a broad age range and to identify the impact of covariates on eteplirsen exposure to guide clinical dosing. Plasma concentration data were pooled from six clinical studies of male patients with DMD across the age range of 6 months to 4 years (1 study) and 4-16 years (5 studies). Doses ranged from 0.5 to 50 mg/kg/week across different studies. A three-compartment model with a linear elimination described the eteplirsen plasma concentration data well. Body weight effect on all PK parameters and eGFR, and age (≤ 4 years vs. > 4 years) effect on systemic clearance were key determinants of variability in the final model. Simulations showed similar exposures for eteplirsen (30 mg/kg intravenously once weekly) across different age groups (0.5 to < 2, 2 to < 4, 4 to < 7, and 7 to ≤ 16 years). These findings support the existing eteplirsen dosing paradigm of uniform weight-based dosing at 30 mg/kg/week across the broad age range of the target DMD population (6 months to adolescence)."

    "abstract": "Purpose To develop a deep learning (DL) model that derives aligned strain values from cine (noncontrast) cardiac MRI and evaluate performance of these values to predict myocardial fibrosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 139 male patients with DMD who underwent cardiac MRI at a single center between February 2018 and April 2023. A DL pipeline was developed to detect five key frames throughout the cardiac cycle and respective dense deformation fields, allowing for phase-specific strain analysis across patients and from one key frame to the next. Effectiveness of these strain values in identifying abnormal deformations associated with fibrotic segments was evaluated in 57 patients (mean age [± SD], 15.2 years ± 3.1), and reproducibility was assessed in 82 patients by comparing the study method with existing feature-tracking and DL-based methods. Statistical analysis compared strain values using <i>t</i> tests, mixed models, and more than 2000 machine learning models; accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity are reported. Results DL-based aligned strain identified five times more differences (29 vs five; <i>P</i> < .01) between fibrotic and nonfibrotic segments compared with traditional strain values and identified abnormal diastolic deformation patterns often missed with traditional methods. In addition, aligned strain values enhanced performance of predictive models for myocardial fibrosis detection, improving specificity by 40%, overall accuracy by 17%, and accuracy in patients with preserved ejection fraction by 61%. Conclusion The proposed aligned strain technique enables motion-based detection of myocardial dysfunction at noncontrast cardiac MRI, facilitating detailed interpatient strain analysis and allowing precise tracking of disease progression in DMD. <b>Keywords:</b> Pediatrics, Image Postprocessing, Heart, Cardiac, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2025."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration due to dystrophin deficiency. Cardiac involvement, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, significantly impacts morbidity and mortality, typically manifesting after age 10. This case report presents a rare instance of early-onset cardiac involvement in a 3-year-old male with a confirmed deletion in exon 55 of the dystrophin gene. The patient developed dilated cardiomyopathy at 3 years and 8 months, with progressive left ventricular dysfunction despite early treatment with corticosteroids, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Genetic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations related to cardiac involvement were reviewed, highlighting emerging therapies such as exon skipping, vamorolone, ifetroban, and rimeporide. Studies indicate that variants in exons 12, 14-17, 31-42, 45, and 48-49 are associated with more severe cardiac impairment. This case emphasizes the need for early, ongoing cardiac assessment and personalized treatment to address disease heterogeneity. While current DMD care standards improve survival, optimizing management through early intervention and novel therapies remains essential. Further research is needed to better understand genotype-phenotype correlations and improve cardiac outcomes for patients with DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder that is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to progressive muscle wasting and weakness. There is currently no cure for DMD. The BL10-mdx mouse is the most commonly used model in preclinical DMD studies, but it exhibits a mild disease phenotype compared to DMD patients, limiting research translatability. The newer D2-mdx mouse has a more severe phenotype at an early age and may better recapitulate human disease. To compare these mouse models on a transcriptional level with quantitative RT-PCR, stable and reliable reference genes are indispensable. We aimed to evaluate the stability and reliability of a panel of nine candidate reference genes (Actb, Ap3d1, Gapdh, Hmbs, Htatsf1, Pak1ip1, Rpl13a, Sdha and Zfp91) in the gastrocnemius, diaphragm and heart of mice from both strains and their corresponding wild types aged 4 to 52 weeks. Data was analyzed using geNorm, BestKeeper, deltaCt and NormFinder. We found that Htatsf1, Pak1ip1 and Zfp91 are suitable reference genes for normalization of gene expression in dystrophic and healthy mice, regardless of the tissue type or age. In our hands, Actb, Gapdh and Rpl13a were not suitable as reference genes, exhibiting tissue-, age-, or disease specific changes in expression.

However, data on renal impairment with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) especially in pediatric populations, and remains scarce. <b>Case Presentation</b> We present the case of a 5-year-old male with a two-month history of foamy urine. Laboratory investigations revealed nephrotic-range proteinuria and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. A subsequent muscle biopsy and genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BMD. <b>Results</b> The patient accepted oral deflazacort for two months.

Chronic kidney impairment in pediatric BMD warrants attention, and the role of kidney biopsy in characterizing DMD/BMD-associated nephropathy should be explored. Given the lifelong and heterogeneous nature of BMD, multicenter study and long-term follow-up are required to better understand the progression, underlying mechanisms, and clinical outcomes of renal complications in these patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, a decline in quality of life, and premature mortality. This study aims to evaluate the perceived quality of healthcare and the experience of DMD patients and their caregivers in Mexico, comparing governmental and non-profit healthcare institutions using a newly designed assessment instrument. In a cross-sectional study, data were gathered from 91 participants through an online self-administered questionnaire informed by the Donabedian model and six dimensions of healthcare quality. Analysis revealed two key mediating factors: perceived quality of healthcare and patient experience. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that non-profit organizations were perceived to provide superior quality care in both aspects (<i>p</i> < 0.05), notably regarding healthcare professionals' preparedness and other domains of quality. However, the patient-centered care domain indicated that the importance of quality domains may vary according to cultural and social contexts. In Mexico, the humanistic approach of healthcare professionals appeared to compensate for shortcomings in timely diagnosis and other quality domains. This emphasizes the necessity for enhanced patient education and healthcare evaluation, and it highlights that patient satisfaction does not always correlate with high-quality healthcare. The developed instrument can further aid in understanding the experiences of DMD patients across different countries and cultures."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe neuromuscular wasting disease that is caused by a primary defect in dystrophin protein and involves organism-wide comorbidities such as cardiomyopathy, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, and nonprogressive cognitive impairments. Physiological stress exposure in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy results in phenotypic abnormalities that include locomotor inactivity, hypotension, and increased morbidity. Severe and lethal stress susceptibility in mdx mice corresponds to metabolic dysfunction in several coordinated metabolic pathways within dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle, as well as prolonged elevation in mdx plasma corticosterone levels that extends beyond the wild-type (WT) stress response. Here, we performed a targeted mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics screen focused on biological stress pathways in healthy and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice exposed to mild scruff stress. One-third of the stress-relevant metabolites interrogated displayed significant elevation or depletion in mdx plasma after scruff stress and were restored to WT levels by skeletal muscle-specific dystrophin expression. The metabolic pathways of mdx mice altered by scruff stress are associated with regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, locomotor tone, neurocognitive function, redox metabolism, cellular bioenergetics, and protein catabolism. Our data suggest that a mild stress triggers an exaggerated, multi-system metabolic response in mdx mice."

We adopted a cross-section survey study. Between February and December 2022, 181 parents responded to the survey including a participants' characteristics section, post-traumatic growth assessment scale, caregiver burden scale, and social support assessment scale. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate influencing factors of post-traumatic growth. The mean score of post-traumatic growth of parents was 56.66 (SD ± 18.67). Post-traumatic growth was positively correlated with social support (r = 0.452, P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with care burden (r = -0.207, P < 0.01). Multiple linear regression showed that the child's age, course of disease, self-care ability, parent's working condition, residence, education, number of children, and health status were the main influencing factors for the post-traumatic growth of parents (P < 0.001). The post-traumatic growth of parents with children with DMD was at a moderate level. Healthcare professionals should pay attention to the psychological state of parents with children with this rare disease and promote post-traumatic growth through psychological mindfulness interventions, strengthening family and social support, and providing care knowledge and skills."

Palliative care is recommended for all patients with DMD, but there is no consensus on the recommended outpatient care model. Our initial objective was to establish a palliative care clinic for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with DMD. We used the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) Community-Based Palliative Care Needs Assessment and Decision-Making Tool to identify a patient population, create structured surveys, and conduct stakeholder interviews. We developed a referral process and created a combination in-person/telehealth clinic. Three major themes were identified based on five surveys and two interviews: (1) stakeholder needs, (2) anticipated challenges, and (3) ideas for collaboration. Between December 2022 and August 2023, there were 16 completed referrals with a median patient age of 21.5 years. Using a formal needs assessment tool, we successfully developed a neuromuscular-focused AYA palliative care clinic."

    "abstract": "Dystrophin is a key protein encoded by the <i>DMD</i> gene, serves as a scaffold linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix that plays a critical role in muscle contraction, relaxation, and structural integrity. Mutations, particularly single-point amino acid substitutions, can lead to dysfunctional Dystrophin, causing muscular dystrophies, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) being the most severe form. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 184 single-point amino acid substitutions on the structure and function of Dystrophin using computational approaches. Many computational tools were used to predict the impact of amino acid substitutions on protein stability, solubility, and function. Pathogenic potential was assessed using disease phenotype predictors and CADD scores, while allele frequency data from gnomAD contextualized mutation prevalence. Additionally, aggregation propensity, frustration analysis, and post-translational modification sites were analyzed for functional disruptions. Of the 184 substitutions analyzed, 50 were identified as deleterious, with 41 predicted to be pathogenic. Seventeen mutations were localized in the Calponin-homology (CH) 1 domain, a critical functional region of Dystrophin. Six substitutions (N26H, N26K, G47W, D98G, G109A, and G109R) were predicted to decrease protein solubility and were located in minimally frustrated regions, potentially compromising Dystrophin functionality and contributing to DMD pathogenesis. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of DMD, highlighting specific mutations that disrupt Dystrophin's solubility and function. These findings could inform future therapeutic strategies targeting Dystrophin mutations to address DMD pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "Bespoke therapies represent a promising tool to address a diverse range of genetic and acquired conditions, offering new hope where conventional treatments have fallen short. With the rapid rise of bespoke therapies, profound ethical and regulatory challenges emerge, making it crucial to establish a comprehensive framework that ensures these treatments reach clinical settings and meet patients' needs as quickly as possible while protecting all parties involved. Although current guidelines are continually evolving to address the range of ethical tensions raised by these therapies, several gaps remain. A significant unresolved question is determining where personalized interventions fall on the research-care continuum and understanding the institutional, regulatory, and ethical implications when custom therapies are classified as research, care, or a mix of both. To address these questions, we introduce a conceptual model alongside practical guidance for the development, administration, and evaluation of individualized therapies, using CRISPR/Cas9-based interventions for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy as a case study. We argue that the goals of an intervention should be as individualized as the bespoke product itself, tailored to the specifics of each case. Rather than attempting to pinpoint the exact location of an intervention on the continuum, which may be hard to operationalize and have limited utility, our approach focuses on the practical details of how such interventions are administered and the individual component parts of an intervention. It advocates for transparent discussions among all partners to anticipate and adjust various components/parameters along the process of administering individualized interventions. Our paper highlights the most critical of these parameters in (1) the planning and development of individualized therapies in laboratory settings, (2) their regulatory oversight, and (3) evaluation. By discussing these stages and parameters in detail, we aim to provide guidance on how to navigate the ethical complexities inherent to individualized interventions and offer a preliminary framework for balancing the interplay between research objectives and patient care needs. Acknowledging that the scientific rigor and adequacy of any new model must be evaluated, we also identify the types of evidence that are required to validate that our model effectively meets individual and societal needs."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients suffer from skeletal and cardiopulmonary weakness, and interestingly up to one third are diagnosed on the autism spectrum. Dystrophin is an essential protein for regulating the transmission of intracellular force to the extracellular matrix within the skeletal muscle, but also plays key roles in neurobehavior and cognitive function. The mouse dystrophin gene (also abbreviated <i>Dmd</i>) is X-linked and has several isoforms with tissue-specific expression, including the large <i>Dp427m</i> muscle transcript found in heart and skeletal muscle, and the <i>Dp427c</i> transcript that encodes the brain-specific dystrophin cerebellar protein. Understanding the functional requirements and pathways that are affected by dystrophin loss will impact dystrophin replacement gene therapy and exon-skipping correction strategies. We generated conditional <i>Dystrophin</i> knockout mice by targeting exon 52 of the mouse <i>Dystrophin</i> (<i>Dmd</i> <sup>flox52</sup>) locus. We generated dystrophin constitutive and inducible myofiber knockout (<i>Dmd</i> mKO) mice to evaluate the tissue-specific function of the large skeletal muscle dystrophin isoform. Constitutive embryonic deletion of the <i>Dystrophin</i> gene exclusively in skeletal myofibers resulted in a severe skeletal muscle myopathy, dystrophic histopathology, and functional deficits compared to the <i>mdx</i> mouse. Transcriptomic analysis of skeletal myofibers of the <i>Dmd</i> mKO mice revealed the dysregulation of key extracellular matrix and cytokine signaling pathways. Separately, we generated Purkinje neuron cerebellar dystrophin knockout (<i>Dmd</i>:Pcp2 KO) mice that displayed neurobehavioral deficits in social approach, social memory, and spatial navigation and working memory. These studies reveal the essential requirement for dystrophin expression in both the skeletal muscle and brain for normal physiological and neurobehavioral function."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common inherited muscle disease. There are currently few effective therapies to treat the disease, although many approaches are being pursued. Certain histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been shown to ameliorate DMD phenotypes in mouse and zebrafish animal models, and the HDACi givinostat has recently gained FDA approval for DMD. Our goal was to identify additional HDACi, or other classes of epigenetic small molecules, that are beneficial for DMD. Using an established animal model for DMD, the zebrafish <i>dmd</i> mutant strain <i>sapje</i> , we screened a library of over 800 epigenetic small molecules of various classes. We used a quantitative muscle birefringence assay to assess and compare the effects of these small molecule treatments on <i>dmd</i> mutant zebrafish skeletal muscle. Our screening identified a new HDACi, SR-4370, that ameliorated <i>dmd</i> mutant zebrafish skeletal muscle degeneration, in addition to HDACi previously shown to improve <i>dmd</i> zebrafish. We find that a single early treatment of HDACi can ameliorate <i>dmd</i> zebrafish. Furthermore, we find that HDACi that improve <i>dmd</i> muscle also cause increased histone acetylation in zebrafish larvae, whereas givinostat does not appear to increase histone acetylation or improve zebrafish <i>dmd</i> muscle. Our results add to the growing evidence that HDACi are promising candidates for treating DMD. Our study also provides further support for the effectiveness of small-molecule screening in <i>dmd</i> zebrafish."

Forty-seven boys were seen in clinic longitudinally with two to six follow up visits for a total of 129 assessments. Ninety four percent of the boys with DMD seen in our clinic demonstrated delays in gross motor skills across the age span when compared with normative controls. None of the boys reached a ceiling on the Bayley-III despite being older than the intended age range of the test.

To understand the current DMD management standards and practices in Asia and to evaluate inconsistencies, unmet needs, and future directions for DMD patient management in the region. Clinical experts from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan convened in September 2023 to discuss DMD diagnosis, assessment, treatment, and management best practices. A pre-meeting survey was also administered to explore professional perspectives and practices and refine the discussion focus. Genetic profiling has become the pivotal diagnostic tool and has been universally adopted by experts. Steroid therapy is recognized as the cornerstone of DMD care. However, there are various opinions regarding the timing of its initiation and whether it should be continued after the loss of ambulation. Gene therapy has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in patients with DMD. However, its adoption is hampered by high costs, the potential for serious adverse events, and difficulties with patient selection. Governments and manufacturers must work together to improve its affordability. Establishing a centralized DMD registry garnered strong support from the experts as it promised to provide insights into unique DMD subtypes, standardize treatment protocols, and facilitate the conduct of clinical trials. Furthermore, the introduction of gene therapy has highlighted the need for generating long-term safety and effectiveness data in patients with DMD. Lastly, a centralized patient registry can be used to inform policy decisions. DMD care in Asia is characterized by substantial heterogeneity, with financial and reimbursement issues playing a major role in management decisions. A centralized patient registry has the potential to address these concerns by providing a valuable source of information."

Acute myocarditis is a potential life-threatening short-term complication that has been reported following GTT. This immune mediated response can range from troponin elevation to rapid cardiovascular compromise and death, particularly in those with abnormal cardiac status at baseline. Early detection of cardiac compromise is essential to optimize outcomes. The primary objective of this consensus statement is to advocate for caution with DMD GTT patient selection and to initiate preemptive monitoring for those who may be at increased risk for cardiac adverse events. Secondary objective is to deepen our understanding of short and long-term impact of DMD gene therapies on the heart. A national learning network of pediatric cardiologists with expertise in DMD developed recommendations for cardiac surveillance of DMD males receiving GTT based on available evidence and expert consensus opinion.

A retrospective study was performed by analyzing 158 PGT-M cycles for DMD/BMD in Reproductive and Genetic Hospital of CITIC-Xiangya between 2009 and 2023. Patients' backgrounds were collected. The effectiveness and safety for five different PGT-M strategies (1-5), including mutation testing from cleavage or trophoblast ectoderm (TE) cells and additional linkage analysis post-TE cell amplification, were analyzed. The embryonic recombination events were assessed for these cycles. Mutation analysis showed that 62.4% of the 125 families had DMD deletions, 16.0% had duplications, and 21.6% had single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Among 125 families, 104 (83.2%) had previously affected fetus or offspring. The highest diagnosis rate (99.56%) was achieved with Strategy 5, which combined mutation testing with SNP-based linkage analysis in TE cells. This strategy 5 also demonstrated an advantage in cases with recombination near the mutation. An intragenic recombination rate of 5.5% was observed in embryos, predominantly in the hotspots (exons 45-55 and exons 3-9) of DMD deletion/duplication mutations. Prenatal diagnosis for 52 families and successful outcomes in all 85 healthy deliveries (live birth rate, 65.89%, 85/129) validated the accuracy and effectiveness of PGT-M. This study provides a highly effective PGT-M strategy (Strategy 5) for DMD/BMD by comparing five different strategies, with the diagnostic yield reaching 99.56%.

Effective in vitro models must replicate the intercellular relationships and physicochemical properties of native ECM to fully capture disease-specific characteristics. Although recent biomaterials support the in vitro biofabrication of pathophysiological environments, they often lack disease-specific ECM features. In this study, DystroGel, a hydrogel derived from the cardiac ECM of a porcine DMD model, replicates the distinct molecular composition of dystrophic cardiac tissue for the first time. The findings indicate that the dystrophic ECM matrix exhibits a unique protein profile, impacting cellular processes critical to DMD pathology.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in a lack of dystrophin protein. This leads to progressive muscle wasting, cardiac and respiratory dysfunction, and premature death. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based therapies represent a promising approach to treating DMD, with several already approved by the FDA. However, the levels of dystrophin restoration achieved in clinical trials are often insufficient for meaningful therapeutic impact, highlighting the urgent need to enhance ASO efficacy. One potential strategy is to improve muscle pathophysiology, which is compromised in DMD due to cycles of necrosis and regeneration, chronic inflammation, and fibrotic and adipose tissue replacement. These disease characteristics may limit ASO efficiency. In this study, we evaluated the combination of tricyclo-DNA-ASO targeting the <i>Dmd</i> exon 23 with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-E), a steroid hormone known to activate the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, enhance protein and ATP synthesis, and exhibit anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. <i>Mdx</i> mice were treated with ASO alone or in combination with 20-E for 8 weeks. While both treatments restored similar levels of dystrophin and significantly improved functional outcomes such as the distance run and maximum speed in the treadmill exhaustion test, other improvements like the specific force and the decrease in the force drop after eccentric contraction were observed only with the combination therapy. Importantly, the cotreatment was well tolerated without liver or kidney toxicity. These findings provide proof of concept that combining 20-E with ASO therapy can ameliorate dystrophic pathology and improve muscle function in a DMD mouse model. By targeting both dystrophin restoration and muscle pathophysiology, this combined approach may offer a therapeutic strategy with the potential for meaningful clinical benefits, warranting further investigation and potential translation to patients."

    "abstract": "Despite exciting developments in cancer immunotherapy, its broad application is limited by the paucity of targetable antigens on the tumor cell surface. As an intrinsic cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen, based on the ratiometric analysis of transcripts, to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1's phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. This led us to design a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases."

    "abstract": "Fast twitch muscle fibers are prone to degradation in skeletal muscle pathologies, such as sarcopenia and muscular dystrophies. We previously showed that the exercise-induced long noncoding RNA CYTOR promotes fast-twitch myogenesis. Here, we identify an independent functional element within human CYTOR, and optimize its RNA delivery. In human primary myoblasts exogenous CYTOR exon 2 recapitulates the effect of full-length CYTOR by boosting fast-twitch myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, chemically modified CYTOR exon 2 RNA<sup>ΨU</sup> (N1-me-PseudoU, 7-methyl guanosine 5'Cap, polyA) enhances RNA stability and reduces immunogenicity to CYTOR<sup>exon2</sup> RNA. Viral- or chemically optimized RNA-mediated CYTOR<sup>exon2</sup> administration drives commitment toward myogenic maturation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy-derived primary myoblasts, myogenic progenitor cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, CYTOR<sup>exon2, m1ΨU</sup> improves key disease characteristics in dystrophic myotubes, including calcium handling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In summary, we identify CYTOR exon 2 as the functional domain of CYTOR that can be delivered in a disease context using chemical modifications. This is of particular importance given the susceptibility of fast muscle fibers in different muscle pathologies such as aging and dystrophies, and the oncogenic effect of CYTOR exon 1. This study, therefore, highlights the potential of identifying functional domains in noncoding RNAs. Delivery, or targeting of RNA domains might constitute next-generation RNA therapeutics."

    "title": "JAG1 overexpression partially rescues muscle function in a zebrafish model of duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and loss of function due to the absence of dystrophin. In this study, we utilized a zebrafish model with a dmd gene knockout to explore the therapeutic potential of JAG1 overexpression in mitigating DMD-associated muscle dysfunction. Dystrophic zebrafish larvae displayed significant impairments in muscle function, evidenced by reduced swimming abilities, decreased birefringence, and disrupted β-dystroglycan localization, indicative of structural degeneration. Overexpression of JAG1, achieved via plasmid injection, partially restored muscle function, as reflected by improvements in stride length and total swimming distance. However, the structural integrity of slow oxidative muscle fibers remained largely unaffected, with a functional decline from 4 to 8 days post-fertilization (dpf) being more indicative of disease progression than structural changes. These findings suggest that the rescue effect of JAG1 overexpression may not be due to the preservation of slow oxidative fibers but rather through a mechanism that reduces susceptibility to contraction-induced injury. Notably, our study faced limitations related to the control of JAG1 expression levels and tissue specificity. Our results highlight the complexity of DMD pathology, where muscle structure and function do not always correlate, emphasizing the need for refined functional assays to better assess therapeutic outcomes. By incorporating functional recovery assessments at 8-10 dpf, zebrafish models can serve as more predictive preclinical tools, potentially enhancing the translational relevance of findings and reducing risks for patients in clinical trials. This study investigates how increasing the levels of a protein called JAG1 can help improve muscle function in a zebrafish model of DMD. By showing partial recovery of muscle activity, the findings suggest new therapeutic strategies that could potentially slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes."

    "title": "Structural, CSD, Molecular Docking, Molecular Dynamics, and Hirshfeld Surface Analysis of a New Mesogen, Methyl-4-(5-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)benzoate.",
    "abstract": "1,2,4-Oxadiazoles are well recognized for their exceptional physical, chemical, and pharmacokinetic properties, making them promising candidates for various therapeutic applications. These include treatments for cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and a broad spectrum of other therapeutic interventions such as antituberculosis, anticancer, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and anticonvulsant activities. In this study, single crystals of a novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative, methyl-4-(5-(4-(octyloxy)phenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)benzoate, were grown by a slow evaporation technique. The structural elucidation was performed using X-ray diffraction analysis, confirming the compound's crystalline structure in the triclinic system. The analysis revealed a linear conformation with bond lengths closely aligned with Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) averages, signifying high precision in the molecular structure. A detailed CSD study identified nine principal configurations of the phenyl octyloxy moiety, underscoring the structural diversity of the compound. Hirshfeld surface analysis highlighted the predominance of C-H···O and C-H···π interactions, with dispersion energy playing a critical role in stabilizing the crystal lattice. Docking studies against key microbial targets, particularly <i>E. coli</i> FabH, demonstrated superior binding energies, suggesting significant antimicrobial potential. The comprehensive suite of structural and computational analyses underscores the potential of the synthesized 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative, which may be one of the promising candidates for antimicrobial drug development. Future <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i> studies will be supportive in optimizing the derivative for enhanced efficacy and further elucidating its pharmacological mechanisms, paving the way for potential clinical applications. This study not only provides insights into the structural and functional properties of a novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative but also highlights its promising role in antimicrobial drug discovery."

The number of genetic therapies targeting the inherited causes of neuromuscular diseases has surged in the last decade. This review aims to highlight the current state of genetic therapies within the framework of precision medicine, focusing on the achievements and the gaps that remain. A major emphasis is on spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as these neuromuscular diseases have seen tremendous recent advancements.

    "abstract": "The muscular dystrophies or muscle-wasting diseases include a diverse group of genetic disorders, which result in progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles, progressive muscle weakness, and comorbid multi-system involvement. Duchenne muscle dystrophy is the most common type of muscular dystrophy with a reported incidence of 1 in every 3500-6000 male live births in the United States. Given the progressive nature of these disorders, skeletal muscle weakness frequently progresses to loss of the ability to ambulate and perform functions of daily life. In addition to affecting the skeletal musculature, many muscular dystrophies have effects on both cardiac and smooth muscles. As respiratory muscles are one of the most frequently affected muscles in patients with muscular dystrophies, progressive respiratory insufficiency may occur with dependance on non-invasive forms of respiratory support. Given the progressive multi-system involvement associated with the muscular dystrophies, perioperative care and the use of general anesthetic agents and opioids may result in postoperative respiratory failure. In an effort to avoid the deleterious effects of anesthetic agents and opioids on hemodynamic and respiratory functions, regional anesthesia may be used as an adjunct to or instead of general anesthesia. This manuscript provides a literature review and educational summary regarding the use of regional anesthetic techniques in pediatric-aged patients with muscular dystrophies."

    "abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a higher incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, than the general population. However, the clinical outcome assessments used in the evaluation of patients with Duchenne and as endpoints in clinical trials require significant patient cooperation, which can be challenging in those with severe behavioral issues and leads to their exclusion. With ongoing expansion of the therapeutic arsenal, we aimed to explore differences in motor function test completion and measurements between Duchenne patients with and without autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a large tertiary care hospital's pediatric neuromuscular clinic. We identified significantly lower rates of motor function testing and motor function test scores among Duchenne patients with autism or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These findings underscore the need for adequate opportunity to complete motor function testing in those patients. Alternatively, the Duchenne community could consider validating more patient-reported outcomes and wearable device outcome measures in trials that families of children with neurodevelopmental disorders could more easily use. These interventions would improve equitable access to new therapies for patients with severe behavioral issues and allow researchers to track broader clinical outcomes among all patients as the Duchenne treatment landscape expands."

    "title": "Longitudinal Outcomes Among Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Canadian Retrospective Population-Based Study.",
    "abstract": "There are few long-term studies evaluating clinical outcomes and mortality among individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); particularly using longitudinal health administrative claims data, reflecting populations managed in typical clinical practice. This study aimed to characterize DMD outcomes via a population-based database. Patients with DMD, diagnosed between 01/1979 and 03/2020 at ≤ 10 years of age, were identified using the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. De-identified longitudinal administrative data from 1998 to 2020 were used to retrospectively assess frequencies and age at first observation of key DMD outcomes including scoliosis, cardiovascular-related complications, severe respiratory-related morbidities, and mortality. Survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier curves were used to describe attrition and estimate probability of patients remaining observation-free by age. This study included 198 patients with median (IQR) follow-up of 9.6 (6.6-15.5) years. Corticosteroid use was observed in 26%, with a mean (SD) percentage of days covered of 31% (39%) from initiation to end of follow-up. Scoliosis observations were captured in 18% (median[IQR] age 12 [11-15] years at first observation), severe respiratory-related morbidities in 20% (14[6.5-18] years), and cardiovascular-related complications in 32% of the cohort (12.5[2-20.5] years). Mortality was observed in 14% of the cohort. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated 15% mortality by age 20 years and 20% by 25 years. In a population-based data set with decades of follow-up, these data provide longitudinal observations of the substantial burden of DMD, and insight into contemporary estimates of mortality and treatment patterns in Canada."

    "title": "Left Ventricular Twist and Circumferential Strain from MRI Tagging Predict Early Cardiovascular Disease in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a prevalent fatal genetic disorder, and heart failure is the leading cause of mortality. Peak left ventricular (LV) circumferential strain (E<sub>cc</sub>), twist, and circumferential-longitudinal shear angle (θ<sub>CL</sub>) are promising biomarkers for the improved and early diagnosis of incipient heart failure. Our goals were as follows: 1) to characterize a spectrum of functional and rotational LV biomarkers in boys with DMD compared with healthy age-matched controls; and 2) to identify LV biomarkers of early cardiomyopathy in the absence of abnormal LVEF or LGE. <b>Methods:</b> Boys with DMD (<i>N</i> = 43) and age-matched healthy volunteers (<i>N</i> = 16) were prospectively enrolled and underwent a 3T CMR exam after obtaining informed consent. Breath-held MRI tagging was used to estimate left ventricular E<sub>cc</sub> at the mid-ventricular level as well as the twist, torsion, and θ<sub>CL</sub> between basal and apical LV short-axis slices. A two-tailed <i>t</i>-test with unequal variance was used to test group-wise differences. Multiple comparisons were performed with Holm-Sidak post hoc correction. Multiple-regression analysis was used to test for correlations among biomarkers. A binomial logistic regression model assessed each biomarker's ability to distinguish the following: (1) healthy volunteers vs. DMD patients, (2) healthy volunteers vs. LGE(-) DMD patients, and (3) LGE(-) DMD patients vs. LGE(+) DMD patients. <b>Results:</b> There was a significant impairment in the peak mid-wall E<sub>cc</sub> [-17.0 ± 4.2% vs. -19.5 ± 1.9%, <i>p</i> < 7.8 × 10<sup>-3</sup>], peak LV twist (10.4 ± 4.3° vs. 15.6 ± 3.1°, <i>p</i> < 8.1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), and peak LV torsion (2.03 ± 0.82°/mm vs. 2.8 ± 0.5°/mm, <i>p</i> < 2.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) of LGE(-) DMD patients when compared to healthy volunteers. There was a further significant reduction in the E<sub>cc</sub>, twist, torsion, and θ<sub>CL</sub> for LGE(+) DMD patients when compared to LGE(-) DMD patients. In the LGE(+) DMD patients, age significantly correlated with LVEF (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.42, <i>p</i> = 9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), peak mid-wall E<sub>cc</sub> (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.046), peak LV Twist (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.06), peak LV torsion (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.28, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and peak LV θ<sub>CL</sub> (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.07). In the LGE(-) DMD patients, only the peak mid-wall E<sub>cc</sub> was significantly correlated with age (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.006). The peak LV twist outperformed the peak mid-wall LV E<sub>cc</sub> and EF in distinguishing DMD patients from healthy volunteer groups (AUC = 0.88, 0.80, and 0.72), as well as in distinguishing LGE(-) DMD patients from healthy volunteers (AUC = 0.83, 0.74, and 0.62). The peak LV twist and peak mid-wall LV E<sub>cc</sub> performed similarly in distinguishing the LGE(-) and LGE(+) DMD cohorts (AUC = 0.74, 0.77, and 0.79). <b>Conclusions:</b> The peak mid-wall LV E<sub>cc</sub>, peak LV twist, peak LV torsion, and peak LV θ<sub>CL</sub> were significantly impaired in advance of the decreased LVEF and the development of focal myocardial fibrosis in boys with DMD and therefore were apparent prior to significant irreversible injury."

    "abstract": "Thirty years ago, in 1995, I proposed a fundamental treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce exon skipping and restore dystrophin expression. DMD is a progressive and fatal muscular dystrophy, and the establishment of an effective therapy has been a pressing demand among patients worldwide. Exon-skipping therapy utilizing ASOs has garnered significant attention as one of the most promising treatments for DMD, stimulating global research and development efforts in ASO technology. Two decades later, in 2016, one ASO was conditionally approved by the U.S. FDA as the first DMD treatment. This review summarizes the current status and challenges of ASO-based exon-skipping therapies for DMD and explores the prospects of pseudoexon skipping using ASOs, which holds the potential for achieving a complete cure for DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein<sup>1,2</sup>. Utrophin (UTRN), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD, is upregulated in some DMD patients<sup>3-5</sup>. To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD<sup>PTC</sup> minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD, aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD<sup>ΔE52</sup> patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation<sup>6-8</sup> plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD<sup>PTC</sup> patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation."

GC use has changed over time with evolving evidence, and we describe GC patterns, dosing and side-effects in the UK over 11 years. NorthStar data from 2012 to 2022 were analysed to understand GC type, regime and starting age. GC dose with age, patterns of GC switching and side-effect profiles by type and regime were also analysed. Participants attributed to 'other' regimes were queried and details were included. Data on GC usage were available for 1117 boys, across 6905 observations, with 74% of boys GC treated. Prednisolone was the most common regime in the period (65% of assessments) but deflazacort prescription has increased (17% in 2012 and 43% in 2022). Daily regimes were more common (66% of assessments), and the incidence of intermittent (10 days on/10 days off) regimes has declined (46% in 2012 and 26% in 2022). Older participants were more commonly on less than recommended doses, and this was more common in those on deflazacort or daily regimes. Gastrointestinal symptoms and cushingoid features were more common in those on deflazacort than prednisolone, while increased appetite, cushingoid features, gastrointestinal symptoms and insomnia were more common in those on daily than intermittent regimes. The use of deflazacort and daily regimes has steadily increased across the UK North Star Network in the last decade. This study provides one of the largest up-to-date real-world set of data of evolution in prescription patterns and the occurrence of side-effects in different groups of GC-treated DMD."

In a cross-sectional questionnaire-based primary data collection conducted from 2020 to 2021 among Czech patients with CF, we collected demographic, clinical, and healthcare resource use data, out-of-pocket and social transfer costs, and questionnaires: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment, EQ-5D, and Zarit Burden Interview. Productivity loss/costs were assessed using the human capital approach with patient patient-assumed life expectancy of 45 years and caregiver retirement age of 64 years and discounted by 3%. A total of 257 patients completed the questionnaires (37% of the Czech CF population). The average age was 17 years; most were females (59%), and the average forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 81.4% (SD 25.4%). A total of 107 patients had caregivers with an average age of 39 years and a significant caregiver time burden (extra 4.6 hours/day). The average Zarit Burden Interview score (25.4) was comparable with advanced cancer, dementia, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The proportion of unemployed caregivers was 10× higher than the general population (31% vs 3.2%). Total out-of-pocket family costs related to CF were €278/month, mainly for medicines (€105), foods (€73), and transport (€59); 25% received a disability pension and 18% other social security benefits. The work impairment of employed patients and caregivers was 25% and 15%, respectively, mostly due to presenteeism. Total lifetime productivity costs extrapolated to all Czech patients with CF (n = 687) and their caregivers were €155 181 286 (€225 883/person). The societal burden imposed on Czech patients with CF and their caregivers is significant. Caregivers seem to be affected by higher disease activity more than patients."

    "abstract": "We aimed to identify novel biomarkers of muscle pathological changes via a large-scale histopathology-based multi-omics study of dystrophinopathies. We performed a comparative pathological analysis of 121 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 114 Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) patients to determine muscle pathological similarities and differences between DMD and BMD that have not been systematically investigated. Customized bioinformatic analyses of bulk muscle RNA-sequencing data derived from 35 DMD patients, 39 BMD patients, and 21 controls were performed to identify gene signatures associated with pathological changes. Validation experiments, including single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, RNAscope in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining, were performed in a subset of DMD and BMD patients, as well as 27 patients with other acquired and inherited myopathies. Systematic pathological analyses revealed that the percentages of necrotic, regenerating, and hypercontractive myofibers and the degree of muscle fibrosis were greater in DMD patients than in BMD patients. In both DMD and BMD patients, the percentages of necrotic, regenerating, and hypercontractive myofibers respectively increased in the early-stage and decreased in later disease stages, whereas muscle fibrosis progressively worsened with disease progression. Comparative transcriptomic analysis indicated that inflammatory responses were significantly activated in DMD patients compared to BMD patients, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry analyses. Our customized bioinformatic analyses identified the gene set of MYH3, MYH8, IL17B, TNNT2, MYMK, and TDO2 as the most associated gene signature for muscle necrosis and regeneration. Muscle quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed significantly increased levels of IL17B and TNNT2 mRNA expression in both DMD and BMD patients compared to controls. Muscle IL17B mRNA expression was significantly correlated with histological muscle regeneration and negatively correlated with the age of patients with dystrophinopathy. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and RNAscope in situ hybridization demonstrated that IL17B mRNA was expressed in regenerating myofibers of patients with DMD and BMD, as well as in various acquired and inherited myopathies. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed that interleukin-17B was expressed in regenerating myofibers of DMD and BMD patients. Our study provides evidence that interleukin-17B is a new biomarker of muscle regeneration in dystrophinopathies."

    "abstract": "Patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have an increased risk of complications when they undergo sedation or general anesthesia. However, due to improvements in cardiopulmonary therapies during anesthetic care, patients with DMD are experiencing an unprecedented duration of survival. We performed a systematic analysis to assess the benefits and risks of pharmacological interventions for the management of anesthesia and sedation in DMD patients. We included any type of study reporting any drug intervention to manage anesthesia and sedation in participants previously diagnosed with DMD. Our primary outcomes were the onset time, recovery time, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Seven electronic databases and three clinical trial registry platforms were searched. Data from the eligible studies were combined to calculate pooled risk ratios or standardized mean differences, and some included studies are presented in a narrative synthesis. Forty studies with 196 DMD participants were included in the analysis. Compared with those of the control group, the sensitivity of patients with DMD to neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may have resulted in a prolonged onset time [MD = -0.96, 95% CI (0.71, 2.60), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 33%, <i>P</i> < 0.0001] and recovery time [MD = 2.22, 95% CI (1.14, 3.30), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 76%, <i>P</i> < 0.0001] from anesthesia. The neuromuscular blocking effects showed a significant age dependence in DMD patients, and the safe use of 2 mg/kg sugammadex to antagonize deep neuromuscular blockade and rapid recovery has been reported. Furthermore, DMD patients are at risk of developing malignant hyperpyrexia with general/inhaled anesthesia, and dantrolene is often used for effective rescue. In addition, general anesthesia and central neuraxial blockade in patients with severe DMD are unsafe because respiratory depression and myocardial complications may occur after the administration of volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine) during the induction of anesthesia. Patients with DMD are more sensitive to NMBAs with delayed onset times and prolonged recovery times. Precautions for DMD patients should include quantitative neuromuscular monitoring, electrocardiographic monitoring and rapid airway protection throughout anesthesia. Compared with general anesthesia, regional anesthesia may be a relatively safe option."

    "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with diverse etiologies. Chromosomal duplications are recognized as a common cause of ID, with manifestations typically milder than those associated with deletions. Duplications involving the short arm of chromosome 7 or the X chromosome have been linked to ID. Limited data exist on duplications at 7p22.1p22.3 and Xp22.31p21.1, leaving their clinical significance largely unexplored. This case report aims to expand the phenotype and genetics spectrum of 7p22 duplication syndrome and X-linked ID. Special attention should be paid to closely monitoring the pubertal progression of such patients. A 9-year-10-month-old female was admitted to our hospital due to distinctive dysmorphic features and ID. Upon examination, features of craniofacial dysmorphism were observed, including micrognathia, a prominent lower lip, a thin upper lip, a flat nasal bridge, and hypertelorism. The child's pubertal development is progressing extremely rapidly; at under 10 years old, the breasts have already advanced to Tanner Stage 4. Her height was within the median range, but her bone age was advanced (12.1 years). Her full-scale intelligence quotient, assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children: 4th edition, was 41. Whole exome sequencing identified a de novo duplication spanning overlapping regions at Xp21-22 and 7p22. This duplication encompasses several genes implicated in ID, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Aristaless-related homeobox, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein like 1, adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma 2, and cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5. A novel duplication in the Xp and 7p of a Chinese female child diagnosed with ID and dysmorphic features has been studied by whole exome sequencing analysis. The novel duplications were a large duplication located in the 7p22.1 to p22.3 region, spanning 12.07 Mb, and a large duplication located in the Xp22.31 to p21.1 region, spanning 24.7 Mb. Our study underscores the importance of comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluation in individuals with duplication on the X chromosome and the terminal region of chromosome 7's short arm. We highlight the need for monitoring these patients for growth and sexual development issues. Our findings also suggest that chromosomal duplication can lead to severe clinical manifestations, emphasizing the critical role of genetic assessment in managing such cases."

The pharmaceutical industries are persistently innovating drug design processes to address the rise of infections and effectively treat emerging syndromes or genetically based disorders with the help of quantitative structure-property relationship models. These models are mathematical tools that correlate molecular structures with their physicochemical properties through structural characteristics. Different models can be generated based on the various structural features of the compounds, and topological indices are one such significant structural feature generated from the molecular graph and are key tools used in these models. This study focuses on creating quantitative structure-property relationship models using degree-based topological indices, which are highly effective in quantitative structure-property relationship analysis to explore the diverse physicochemical properties of Duchenne muscular dystrophy drugs with the prediction of properties of a recently approved drug givinostat. Furthermore, the drug discovery and development activities can be accelerated using the developed models to forecast the possible productiveness of novel Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment drugs."

    "abstract": "Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for the regenerative capabilities of skeletal muscles. MuSCs are maintained in a quiescent state, but, when activated, can undergo proliferation and differentiation into myocytes, which fuse and mature to generate muscle fibers. The maintenance of MuSC quiescence and MuSC activation are processes that are tightly regulated by autophagy, a conserved degradation system that removes unessential or dysfunctional cellular components via lysosomes. Both the upregulation and downregulation of autophagy have been linked to impaired muscle regeneration, causing myopathies such as cancer cachexia, sarcopenia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this Review, we highlight the importance of autophagy in regulating MuSC activity during muscle regeneration. Additionally, we summarize recent studies that link the transcriptional dysregulation of autophagy to muscle atrophy, emphasizing the dominant roles that transcription factors play in myogenic programs. Deciphering and understanding the roles of these transcription factors in the regulation of autophagy during myogenesis could advance the development of regenerative medicine."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked devastating disease caused by a lack of dystrophin which results in progressive muscle weakness. As muscle weakness progresses, respiratory insufficiency and hypoventilation result in significant morbidity and mortality. The most studied DMD mouse model- the mdx mouse- has a milder respiratory phenotype compared to humans, likely due to compensatory overexpression of utrophin. mdx/utrn-/- mice lack both dystrophin and utrophin proteins. These mice have an early onset of muscular dystrophy, severe muscle weakness, and premature death, but the respiratory pathophysiology is unclear. The objective of this study is to characterize the respiratory pathophysiology and histopathology using whole body plethysmography to measure breathing and metabolism, diaphragm muscle functional analysis, histology, and immunohistochemistry. The mdx/utrn-/- mice have significant respiratory and metabolic deficits with respiratory insufficiency and hypoventilation when exposed to hypoxia and hypercarbia as early as 6 weeks of age. They also have significant diaphragmatic weakness and disrupted diaphragmatic structural pathology. The mdx/utrn-/- mice display respiratory dysfunction that mimics the DMD phenotype and therefore can provide a useful model to study the impact of novel therapies on respiratory function for DMD."

    "abstract": "Exon skipping with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) can correct disease-causing mutations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) through RNA-targeted splice correction. This correction restores the reading frame and supports expression of near full-length dystrophin. First-generation exon 51-skipping ASOs targeted the same binding site, with limited clinical efficacy. We characterized a novel binding site within exon 51 that induced highly efficient exon skipping. A precursor ASO (AON-C12) and clinical ASO (BMN 351) were designed using 2'-<i>O</i>-methyl-modified phosphorothioate (2'OMePS) RNA and locked nucleic acids. hDMDdel52/<i>mdx</i> mice were given AON-C12 or BMN 351 for 13 weeks and evaluated for molecular and phenotypic correction of dystrophin deficiency. BMN 351 treatment induced durable, dose-dependent levels of exon skipping and dystrophin production in all muscles evaluated. In the heart, 8 weeks after the last BMN 351 dose at 18 mg/kg, exon-skipped transcripts remained at 44.3% of total, and dystrophin levels were 21.8% of wild type. BMN 351 reached higher tissue concentrations and percent exon skipping in the heart than a clinically relevant peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer comparator. BMN 351 also improved gait scores and clinical and anatomical muscle pathology parameters compared with vehicle-treated hDMDdel52/<i>mdx</i> mice. The pharmacologic activity and safety of BMN 351 warrant further nonclinical and clinical development."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations of the <i>DMD</i> gene that prevent the expression of functional dystrophin protein. BMN 351 is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to induce skipping of exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA and production of internally deleted but functional dystrophin. We determined whether extended-term BMN 351 dosing leads to exon skipping, dystrophin production, and improved motor function in hDMDdel52/<i>mdx</i> mice containing a human exon 52-deleted <i>DMD</i> transgene. Weekly intravenous doses of vehicle, 6 mg/kg BMN 351, or 18 mg/kg BMN 351 were administered for 25 weeks, and samples were analyzed 4 and 12 weeks post-dosing. BMN 351 produced dose-dependent exon skipping levels in the heart and quadriceps muscles, accompanied by dose-dependent increases in mean dystrophin levels of 17% to 55% 12 weeks post-dosing. Compared with vehicle-treated hDMDdel52/<i>mdx</i> mice, BMN 351 ameliorated DMD-related histopathologic changes in the gastrocnemius muscle and heart. Both BMN 351 doses preserved fine motor kinematics, which was worse in vehicle-treated hDMDdel52/<i>mdx</i> mice compared with wild-type 4 and 12 weeks post-dosing. Liver samples demonstrated findings consistent with ASO accumulation, to which mice are considered especially sensitive compared to humans and other non-clinical species.

Large cohorts predict a full-scale IQ (FSIQ) of 88.3 ± 13.9 among all patients with BMD and 86.1 ± 15.0 among all patients with DMD, while variants impacting the brain dystrophin isoform Dp140 are associated with FSIQ of 77.7 ± 10.8 in BMD and 78.8 ± 18.6 in DMD. An FSIQ one standard deviation below these expected ranges should prompt screening for alternative causes of neurodevelopmental delays, and an FSIQ two standard deviations below these ranges should prompt broad-spectrum genetic testing."

To describe the real-world treatment and health care utilization among patients with DMD, by race, in a Medicaid population. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with DMD in the Merative Multi-State Medicaid Database between January 2017 and June 2021. Patients with DMD were identified using a validated algorithm and included male patients with at least 2 DMD diagnoses (earliest DMD diagnosis date = index date), aged 40 years or younger, with at least 12 months of continuous enrollment prior to index date, and with at least 12 months (or evidence of death) following the index date were selected. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment utilization, and health care utilization and costs were reported by race and ethnicity in the 12-month baseline and 12-month follow-up periods. A total of 561 patients were included in the study, of which 360 (64.2%) were White, 50 (8.9%) were Black, 33 (5.9%) were Hispanic, and 118 (21.0%) were of other/unknown race and ethnicity. The median age on the index date was 16, 13, 14, and 15 years among the race and ethnicity categories, respectively. In the follow-up, period clinical characteristics were similar across cohorts. Corticosteroids were the most commonly received treatment, with the highest use among Hispanic patients (73%) and lowest use among Black patients (52%). A third of patients treated with corticosteroids received deflazacort, with similar utilization across groups. Exon-skipping therapy use was rare, with 3% utilization overall, and highest use among White patients (4.2%). In both the baseline and follow-up periods, differences in health care costs were not statistically significant. White patients had the highest total costs in the follow-up period (mean [SD] = $108,895 [$346,934]) compared with $59,501 [$85,758] in the Black cohort, $61,199 [$67,021] in the Hispanic cohort, and $65,247 [$119,733] in the unknown/other cohort. Differences in total health care costs were driven by outpatient pharmacy costs, likely because of the larger proportion of White patients having a prescription for an exon-skipping therapy. Differences were seen across race and ethnicities in select clinical characteristics, DMD treatments, and health care utilization and costs in a Medicaid population."

    "title": "Targeting Drug Delivery System to Skeletal Muscles: A Comprehensive Review of Different Approaches.",
    "abstract": "The skeletal muscle is one of the largest organs in the body and is responsible for the mechanical activity required for posture, movement and breathing. The effects of current pharmaceutical therapies for skeletal muscle diseases are far from satisfactory; approximately 24% of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) trials have been terminated because of unsatisfactory outcomes. The lack of a skeletal muscle-targeting strategy is a major reason for these unsuccessful trials, contributing to low efficiency and severe side effects. The development of targeting strategies for skeletal muscle-specific drug delivery has shown the potential for increasing drug concentrations in the skeletal muscle, minimising off-target effects, and thereby improving the therapeutic effects of drugs. Over the past few decades, novel methods for specifically delivering cargo to skeletal muscles have been developed. In this review, we categorise targeting methods into four types: peptides, antibodies, small molecules and aptamers. Most research has focused on peptide and antibody ligands, and there are several well-established drugs in this category; however, drawbacks such as protease degradation and immunogenicity limit their use. Aptamers and small molecules have low immunogenicity and are simple to chemically produce. However, small molecule ligands generally exhibit lower affinity because of their small size and high mobility. Aptamers are promising ligands for skeletal muscle-targeting delivery systems. Additionally, if the active site of the cargo is located inside the cell, an internalisation pathway becomes necessary. The order of internalisation ligands and targeting ligands in the complex is a crucial factor, because an inappropriate order could lead to much lower targeting and internalisation efficiencies. Moreover, ligand density also merits consideration, as increasing the density of the targeting ligands may result in steric hindrance, which could impact the accessibility of the receptor and cause enlargement of the targeted ligands. More efforts are required to optimise drug delivery systems that specifically recognise skeletal muscle, with the aim of enhancing quality of life and promoting patient well-being."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common childhood muscular dystrophy, arises from DMD gene mutations, affecting the production of muscle dystrophin protein. Brain dystrophin-gene products are also transcribed via internal promoters. Their deficiency contributes to comorbidities, including intellectual disability ( ~ 22% of patients), autism ( ~ 6%) and attention deficit disorders ( ~ 18%), representing a major unmet need for patients and families. Thus, improvement of their diagnosis and treatment is needed. Dystrophic mouse models exhibit similar phenotypes, where genetic therapies restoring brain dystrophins improve their behaviour. This suggests that future genetic therapies could address both muscle and brain dysfunction in DMD patients."

In the genetically inherited muscle disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), muscle regeneration is disrupted, leading to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and early mortality. Previously, it has been suggested that type-2 innate immune cells, particularly eosinophils and their production of IL-4, play an essential role in effective muscle regeneration after acute injury. We here re-investigate the role of eosinophils in skeletal muscle repair using mice deficient in eosinophils (ΔdblGATA), or deficient in IL-4R/IL-13R signaling through STAT6 (Stat6-/-). We show that neither deficiency has an impact on skeletal muscle regeneration in response to acute injury as quantified by fiber size, immune cell infiltration, or muscle-resident stem cell proliferation. We also investigate the role of STAT6 signaling in mdx:Stat6-/- mice, a model of DMD and, again, find that ablation of STAT6 signaling has no effect on the rate or severity of fibrotic scar formation or disease progression. In contrast to previous models, our data suggest a negligible role for eosinophils and STAT6 signaling in skeletal muscle regeneration after acute or chronic injury."

    "abstract": "Adult skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are indispensable for muscle regeneration and tightly regulated by macrophages (MPs) and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) in their niche. Deregulated MuSC/MP/FAP interactions and the ensuing inflammation and fibrosis are hallmarks of dystrophic muscle. Here we demonstrate intrinsic deletion of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in MuSCs exacerbates dystrophic pathologies by altering composition and heterogeneity of MPs and FAPs. Further analysis reveals YY1 loss induces expression of immune genes in MuSCs, including C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (Ccl5). Augmented CCL5 secretion promotes MP recruitment via CCL5/C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) crosstalk, which subsequently hinders FAP clearance through elevated Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1). Maraviroc-mediated pharmacological blockade of the CCL5/CCR5 axis effectively mitigates muscle dystrophy and improves muscle performance. Lastly, we demonstrate YY1 represses Ccl5 transcription by binding to its enhancer thus facilitating promoter-enhancer looping. Altogether, our study demonstrates the critical role of MuSCs in actively shaping their niche and provides novel insight into the therapeutic intervention of muscle dystrophy."

This resulting muscle deterioration and fibrosis, eventually causes respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy. While there is currently no cure, existing therapies aim to prolong survival and alleviate symptoms. This paper reviews current and emerging therapies for DMD, focusing on their safety and efficacy. Although corticosteroids remain the standard treatment, newly approved drugs such as exon-skipping therapies, vamorolone, delandistrogene moxeparvovec, and givinostat provide new treatment options. Additionally, future therapies, including gene therapy, stem cell treatments, and anti-fibrotic agents, show promise for clinical application. Advancements in DMD treatments have expanded patient options. While gene therapy offers potential for correcting the genetic defect and alleviating symptoms, corticosteroids remain the most cost-effective and well-researched treatment. This is partly due to the lack of compelling long-term safety and efficacy data for gene therapies. The accelerated FDA review process has enabled faster approval of new medications; however many have provided minimal clinical benefit to patients. Despite these challenges, continued drug development and innovative research offer hope to patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe neuromuscular disease due to loss of dystrophin, leading to progressive muscle wasting and physical inactivity. In this pilot study, we studied the effect of daily supplementation of the anabolic substrate beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on whole body protein and amino acid kinetics using novel isotope methods and daily activity in a canine model of DMD. Six DMD dogs were administered 3 g daily of HMB or placebo for 28 days according to a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover design. We measured pre- and post-intervention daily activity, biochemistry markers, and whole-body amino acid kinetics. We tracked daily activity with an activity monitoring device and measured plasma creatine kinase and standard clinical biochemistry panels to monitor muscle and organ function. To calculate whole body and intracellular amino acid production, we administered in the postabsorptive state an IV stable isotope solution containing 20 amino acid tracers. We collected blood before and six times after until two hours post tracer pulse administration and measured amino acid enrichments and concentrations by LC-MS/MS, subsequently followed by (non) compartmental modeling of the decay enrichment curves. Results were expressed as mean with 95% CI. Whole body production, plasma concentrations, and intra-/extracellular compartmental analyses of various amino acids were attenuated in HMB-dosed DMD dogs. Specifically, the plasma concentration of hydroxyproline (marker of collagen breakdown) was significantly higher in the placebo group compared to the HMB group. The intra- and extracellular pool sizes and flux between the two compartments of hydroxyproline was reduced in HMB treated dogs. DMD dogs treated with HMB as compared to placebo had a respective 40% increase in exertional (play) (951 [827, 1075] versus 569 [491, 647]; p < 0.0001) and 10.5% increase in non-exertional (active) activity (15,366 [14742, 15990] versus 13,806 [13148,14466]; p = 0.0016). In addition, a 6% reduction was found in rest time after HMB supplementation compared to placebo (23,857 [23,130, 24,584], versus 25,363 [24500, 26225]; p = 0.0122). Creatine kinase was not statistically different between groups. We did not observe any adverse clinical or biochemical-related effects of HMB dosing. Daily HMB supplementation in DMD dogs can safely and positively influence protein and amino acid metabolism and improve overall daily activity."

Improvements in DMD management have increased patient life expectancy; therefore, there is a growing requirement for patients to transfer from paediatric to adult care services. There is also a need for clear recommendations to guide this process. To establish international consensus guidelines regarding best practices for transitioning patients with DMD from paediatric to adult care and ensuring continuity of treatment. Consensus statements were developed using the Delphi process and scored using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The initiative was led by a steering committee (one non-voting chair and two voting members) who recruited 15 expert panellists to form the consensus group. Following an initial systematic literature search, the consensus group voted in three voting rounds. Round 1 (free-text responses to questions) and Round 2 (importance ranking of statements) were completed using an online survey. Round 3 (voting on final consensus statements) took place during a virtual consensus meeting. Consensus was reached on 48 statements covering the topics of transition planning, the transition process, post-transfer management, communicating with young people with DMD and supporting them with the transition to adult life. These consensus statements provide guidelines for improving transition practices for young people with DMD and promoting continued care at a comparable standard in adulthood."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, progressive skeletal and cardiac myopathy. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in patients with DMD, but the molecular basis for heart failure is incompletely understood. As with humans, in the mdx mouse model of DMD, cardiac function is impaired after the onset of skeletal muscle pathology. Dysregulation of Klotho gene regulation in dystrophic skeletal muscles occurs at disease onset, affecting pathogenesis. Whether Klotho is protective against dystrophin-deficient cardiomyopathy is unknown. This study found that expression of a Klotho transgene prevented deficits in left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening in mdx mice. Improvements in cardiac performance were associated with reductions in adverse cardiac remodeling, cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, and fibrosis. In addition, mdx mice expressed high concentrations of plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and expression was increased locally in hearts. The cardioprotective effects of Klotho were not associated with differences in renal function or serum biochemistries, but transgene expression prevented increased expression of plasma FGF23 and cardiac Fgf23 mRNA expression. Cardiac reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis were reduced in transgenic hearts. FGF23 stimulated hypertrophic growth in dystrophic neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes in vitro, which was inhibited by co-stimulation with soluble Klotho. Taken together, these results show that Klotho prevented dystrophic cardiac remodeling and improved function."

Normally, the DMD gene gives rise to many dystrophin isoforms, of which multiple are expressed in the brain. The location of the mutation determines the number of dystrophin isoforms affected, and the absence thereof leads to behavioral and cognitive impairments. Even though behavioral studies have thoroughly investigated the effects of the loss of Dp427, and to a lesser extent of Dp140, in mice, direct comparisons between models lacking multiple dystrophin isoforms are sparse. Furthermore, a behavioral characterization of the DMD-null mouse, which lacks all dystrophin isoforms, has never been undertaken. Using a wide variety of behavioral tests, we directly compared impairments between mdx5cv, mdx52 and DMD-null mice. We confirmed the role of Dp427 in emotional reactivity. We did not find any added effects of loss of Dp140 on fear, but showed the involvement of Dp140 in spontaneous behavior, specifically in habituation and activity changes due to light/dark switches. Lastly, our results indicate that Dp71/Dp40 play an important role in many behavioral domains, including anxiety and spontaneous behavior."

We conducted a scoping review of the literature on these imaging modalities to assess gaps in knowledge and subsequently collaborated with a panel of neuromuscular imaging experts to generate recommendations on the road ahead. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Three-hundred and twenty-eight studies were screened and one hundred and five studies were included. MRI indices related to intramuscular fat content, STIR positivity and T2<sub>water</sub> are used as diagnostic as well as prognostic and monitoring biomarkers. Ultrasound echogenicity can be used as a diagnostic and potentially as a prognostic and monitoring biomarker. DEXA lean muscle mass may be used as an additional monitoring biomarker.

In particular, four antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies targeting various DMD-causing mutations have achieved FDA approval, marking major milestones in the treatment of this disease. These compounds are designed to induce alternative splicing events that restore the translation reading frame of the dystrophin gene, leading to the generation of internally-deleted, but mostly functional, pseudodystrophin proteins with the potential to compensate for the genetic loss of dystrophin. However, the efficacy of these compounds is very limited, with delivery remaining a key obstacle to effective therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for improved ASO technologies with better efficacy, and with applicability to a wider range of patient mutations.

Loss of satellite cell pool and function leads to skeletal muscle wasting in many conditions and disease states. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) were increased in satellite cells after muscle injury. Conditional ablation of Fn14 in Pax7-expressing satellite cells drastically reduced their expansion and skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Fn14 was required for satellite cell self-renewal and proliferation as well as to prevent precocious differentiation. Targeted deletion of Fn14 inhibited Notch signaling but led to the spurious activation of STAT3 signaling in regenerating skeletal muscle and in cultured muscle progenitor cells. Silencing of STAT3 improved proliferation and inhibited premature differentiation of Fn14-deficient satellite cells. Furthermore, conditional ablation of Fn14 in satellite cells exacerbated myopathy in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), whereas its overexpression improved the engraftment of exogenous muscle progenitor cells into the dystrophic muscle of mdx mice. Altogether, our study highlights the crucial role of Fn14 in the regulation of satellite cell fate and function and suggests that Fn14 can be a potential molecular target to improve muscle regeneration in muscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked neuromuscular disorder, characterised by progressive immobility, chronic inflammation and premature death, is caused by the loss of the mechano-transducing signalling molecule, dystrophin. In non-contracting cells, such as neurons, dystrophin is likely to have a functional role in synaptic plasticity, anchoring post-synaptic receptors. Dystrophin-expressing hippocampal neurons are key to cognitive functions such as emotions, learning and the consolidation of memories. In the context of disease-induced chronic inflammation, we have explored the role of the pleiotropic cytokine, interleukin (IL)-6 in hippocampal dysfunction using immunofluorescence, electrophysiology and metabolic measurements in dystrophic <i>mdx</i> mice. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 projections was suppressed in <i>mdx</i> slices. Given the importance of mitochondria-generated ATP in synaptic plasticity, reduced maximal respiration in the CA1 region may impact upon this process. Consistent with a role for IL-6 in this observation, early LTP was suppressed in dystrophin-expressing wildtype slices exposed to IL-6. In dystrophic <i>mdx</i> mice, exposure to IL-6 suppressed mitochondrial-mediated basal metabolism in CA1, CA3 and DG hippocampal regions. Furthermore, blocking IL-6-mediated signalling by administering neutralising monoclonal IL-6 receptor antibodies intrathecally, normalised LTP in <i>mdx</i> mice. The impact of dystrophin loss from the hippocampus was associated with modified cellular bioenergetics, which underpin energy-driven processes such as the induction of LTP. The additional challenge of pathophysiological levels of IL-6 resulted in altered cellular bioenergetics, which may be key to cognitive deficits associated with the loss of dystrophin."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of hereditary diseases marked by progressive muscle loss, leading to weakness and degeneration of skeletal muscles. These conditions often result from structural defects in the Dystrophin-Glycoprotein Complex (DGC), as seen in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD). Since MDs currently have no cure, research has focused on identifying potential therapeutic targets to improve patients' quality of life. In this study, skeletal muscle tissue samples from DMD and BMD patients, as well as non-dystrophic controls, were analyzed using label-free mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to characterize the proteomic profile of these conditions and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis. In-silico analysis revealed that dystrophic muscle tissues are linked to biological processes related to cellular energy metabolism, including oxidation of organic compounds, energy production, and cellular respiration. Enrichment of functions associated with cell structure and RNA binding was also observed, including cytoskeletal protein binding and RNA binding. The human phenotypes most related to the proteomic signature were abnormal circulating metabolites, muscle physiology, and weakness. Quantitative analysis identified significant changes in proteins associated with sarcomere organization and protein ubiquitination, such as myomesin, myozenin, and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase rififylin, suggesting these as potential therapeutic targets."

    "abstract": "Long term glucocorticoid treatment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is associated with a high incidence of fragility fractures. This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis in children and adults with DMD. Three online databases (Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library) were searched for studies that evaluated interventions for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis in DMD. Included studies had to report changes in bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral content (BMC) Z-scores or fracture incidence. Nineteen studies were identified, including twelve that evaluated bisphosphonate, three evaluated testosterone (2 studies of the same patient group), one evaluated vitamin D/calcium, one teriparatide, and two evaluated vibration therapy. Only two randomised-controlled trials were found, one of intravenous bisphosphonate and one of vibration therapy. Changes in lumbar spine BMD ranged from -0.3 to +1.3 in studies of bisphosphonate and - 0.2 to 0.0 with vibration therapy, whereas this was +0.38 with testosterone and + 0.9 with vitamin D/calcium. There was limited information on impact on fracture in all studies. None of the pharmacological studies involved a fracture naïve group at baseline. In addition, none addressed a group of individuals over 18 years at baseline. This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of bisphosphonate therapy in improving bone density in children and adolescents with DMD. However, there is less information on the impact on fracture. The review did not find studies exclusively in those over 18 years old with DMD and limited information on non-bisphosphonate pharmacological agents."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) progressively leads to loss of limb function due to muscle weakness. The incurable nature of the disease shifts the focus to improving quality of life, including assistive supports to improve arm function. Over time, the passive joint impedance (Jimp) of people with DMD increases. Force-based controlled motorised arm supports require a clear distinction between the user's movement intention and passive forces, such as passive Jimp. Therefore, Jimp identification is essential. This review aims to define Jimp, identify factors influencing it, and outline experimental methods used for quantification, with a focus on the upper extremities in DMD. A literature review was performed in May 2021 and updated in March 2024 using SCOPUS, PubMed, IEEEXplore, and WebOfScience. The results reveal confusion in definitions and show various Jimp measuring practices for both DMD and individuals without muscle weakness. This study presents an overview and lists important parameters affecting passive Jimp, such as the joint's position, velocity and the multi-articular nature of the upper arm muscles. For personalised passive Jimp compensation in arm supports, ramp-type perturbations with constant velocity across the full joint range appear most optimal for identifying the elevated and non-linear nature of the passive Jimp in DMD."

    "abstract": "The most severe form of muscular dystrophy (MD), known as Duchenne MD (DMD), remains an incurable disease, hence the ongoing efforts to develop supportive therapies. The dysregulation of autophagy, a degradative yet protective mechanism activated when tissues are under severe and prolonged stress, is critically involved in DMD. Treatments that harness autophagic capacities therefore represent a promising therapeutic approach. Osmolytes are protective organic molecules that regulate osmotic pressure and cellular homeostasis and may support tissue-repairing autophagy. We therefore explored the effects of the osmolyte ectoine in the standard mouse model of DMD, the mdx, focusing on the autophagy-related proteome. Mice were treated with ectoine in their drinking water (150 mg/kg) or through daily intraperitoneal injection (177 mg/kg) until they were 5.5 weeks old. Hind limb muscles were dissected, and samples were prepared for Western blotting for protein quantification and for immunofluorescence for an evaluation of tissue distribution. We report changes in the protein levels of autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), Ser366-phosphorylated sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), activated microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3 II) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Most importantly, ectoine significantly improved the balance between LC3 II and SQSTM1 levels in mdx gastrocnemius muscle, and LC3 II immunostaining was most pronounced in muscle fibers of the tibialis anterior from treated mdx. These findings lend support for the further investigation of ectoine as a potential therapeutic intervention for DMD."

    "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy represents the most important life-limiting condition of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients after the age of 20. Genetic alterations in the DMD gene result in the absence of functional dystrophin protein, leading to skeletal/cardiac muscle impairment. The DMD incidence is one in 5000 live male births. Identifying the genetic background, in addition to DMD disease-causing variants, is one of the unmet needs in understanding the cardiac disease's pathogenetic mechanisms and its prognostic implications. The clinical scenario is made even more intricate by the difficulty in predicting the onset and progression of cardiomyopathy, as no clear genotype/phenotype correspondence has been found thus far. The evaluation of genes involved in the onset of primary cardiomyopathies could explore the hypothesis that changes in cytoskeletal and sarcomeric protein function are the modulators of ventricular dysfunction in DMD patients. In the last decade, with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, many disease-causing genes and modifiers have been identified. Assessing the genetic origin of the phenotypic variability of the disease in both the onset and progression of cardiomyopathy in DMD would be extremely helpful in managing these patients. This review article aims to spotlight the genetic background associated with Cardiomyopathy in DMD patients toward a more predictive personalized model of care."

    "abstract": "Prophylactic treatment of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) delays onset of LVD, but there is limited data showing impact on survival. Our aim was to describe survival among treated and untreated individuals with DMD. Retrospective, population-based surveillance data from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking and Research Network (MD STARnet) were used. We analyzed 327 males with DMD born between 1982 and 2009 who were at least 6 years old at the last visit and who initiated cardiac prophylactic medication before age 14 years. Death status was ascertained through vital record linkages and medical record review. Prophylaxis was defined as cardiac medication use at least 1 year before LVD onset (ejection fraction < 55% or shortening fraction < 28%). Age at first visit, corticosteroid use, scoliosis surgery, initiation of noninvasive ventilation, and loss of ambulation were also coded. Cox Proportional Hazard modeling with time-varying covariates describes associations. Prophylactic cardiac treatment was documented for 27.7% (n = 90); corticosteroids were used by 60.9% (n = 157). Adjusting for age at first visit and MD STARnet site, prophylactic treatment was associated with a 54% lower hazard of death (HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22-0.93) compared to no prophylaxis. Adjusting for selected clinical covariates did not appreciably change the estimate (HR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.22-0.99). Initiation of cardiac medication when left ventricular function is normal was associated with prolonged survival in this study of males with DMD. Only one-quarter of individuals received this treatment, however, indicating a topic of focus for improving care."

The advent of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized genome editing, offering a transformative approach to targeting disease-causing mutations directly. This article examines the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of various CVDs, including atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, hypertension, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The technology's ability to correct single-gene mutations with high precision and efficiency positions it as a groundbreaking tool in cardiovascular therapy. Recent developments have extended the capabilities of CRISPR-Cas9 to include mitochondrial genome editing, a critical advancement for addressing mitochondrial dysfunctions often linked to cardiovascular disorders. Despite its promise, significant challenges remain, including off-target effects, ethical concerns, and limitations in delivery methods, which hinder its translation into clinical practice. This article also explores the ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding gene editing technologies, emphasizing the implications of somatic versus germline modifications. Future research efforts should aim to enhance the accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9, improve delivery systems for targeted tissues, and ensure the safety and efficacy of treatments in the long term. Overcoming these obstacles could enable CRISPR-Cas9 to not only treat but also potentially cure genetically driven cardiovascular diseases, heralding a new era in precision medicine for cardiovascular health."

Using a dystrophin<sup>-/-</sup>utrophin<sup>-/-</sup> (DKO-Hom) mouse model, we investigated the PGE2/EP2 pathway in the pathogenesis of dystrophic muscle and its potential as a therapeutic target. We found that Ep2, Ep4, Cox-2, 15-Pgdh mRNA, and PGE2 were significantly increased in DKO-Hom mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The EP2 and EP4 receptors were mainly expressed in CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages and were significantly increased in the muscle tissues of both dystrophin<sup>-/-</sup> (mdx) and DKO-Hom mice compared to WT mice. Osteogenic and osteoclastogenic gene expression in skeletal muscle also increased in DKO-Hom mice, which correlates with severe muscle heterotopic ossification (HO). Treatment of DKO-Hom mice with the EP2 antagonist PF04418948 for 2 weeks increased body weight and reduced HO and muscle pathology by decreasing both total macrophages (CD68<sup>+</sup>) and senescent macrophages (CD68<sup>+</sup>P21<sup>+</sup>), while increasing endothelial cells (CD31<sup>+</sup>). PF04418948 also increased bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) of the tibia trabecular bone, and the cortical bone thickness of both the femur and tibia without affecting spine trabecular bone microarchitecture. In summary, our results indicate that targeting EP2 improves muscle pathology and improves bone mass in DKO mice."

Creatine supplementation has demonstrated several benefits for the muscle, such as increased strength, enhanced tissue repair, and improved ATP resynthesis. This preliminary study aimed to investigate the effects of creatine on the gastrocnemius muscle in dystrophy muscle (MDX) and healthy C57BL/10 mice. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty MDX and C57Bl/10 mice were organized into groups and supplemented or not with creatine in a dosage of 0.3 mg for 8 weeks. Gastrocnemius tissue was analyzed using histomorphology and histomorphometric techniques. <b>Results:</b> The results demonstrated potential anti-inflammatory effects of creatine, with less observation of inflammatory infiltrates, the preservation of intramuscular glycogen, and reduction in tissue fibrosis in supplemented animals. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings suggest that creatine may enhance tissue function and slow the progression of DMD. However, further research, with more analysis, is needed to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying creatine's effects on reducing mononuclear leukocytes and its role in mitigating tissue fibrosis."

There is limited evidence regarding the fracture incidence of adults with DMD. The aim of this study was to examine radiologically confirmed fractures in adults with DMD and review bone health monitoring. This was a retrospective review of all adult males ≥ 16 years with DMD under the care of adult physicians in the West of Scotland (2013-2022). Information regarding fractures, bone health monitoring, and bisphosphonate therapy was collected. Thirty-six men (median age at first visit 18.8 years) with DMD were included. Twelve were taking corticosteroids at first review, and a further 12 had previously been taking corticosteroids that were discontinued in childhood or adolescence. The fracture incidence rate was higher in the corticosteroid group (888.9 per 10,000 person years (95% CI 242.2-2275.9)) than in those not on corticosteroids (156.3 per 10,000 person years (95% CI 32.2-456.6)). Eighteen had lateral spine radiographs for vertebral fracture assessment and 15 had a DXA scan for bone density assessment during the follow-up period. The fracture incidence in adult men with DMD is more than double that of UK men aged 18-49 years old, with an even higher incidence in those treated with corticosteroids. Fewer than half of the study population underwent bone monitoring. There is a need for enhanced clinical guidance for the monitoring and management of osteoporosis during transition and throughout adulthood."

We describe protocols for delivery of ASOs to patient-derived organoid models and confirm reversal of disease-associated phenotypes in cardiac organoids derived from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a structural deletion in the gene encoding dystrophin (DMD) that is amenable to treatment with existing ASO therapeutics. Furthermore, we designed novel patient-specific ASOs for two additional patients with DMD (siblings) with a deep intronic variant in the DMD gene that gives rise to a novel splice acceptor site, incorporation of a cryptic exon and premature transcript termination. We showed that treatment of patient-derived cardiac organoids with patient-specific ASOs results in restoration of DMD expression and reversal of disease-associated phenotypes.

In vitro, dystrophic cells from the mdx mouse were treated with full-spectrum CBD oil and assessed with cell viability and cytotoxic analyses. In vivo, fourteen-day-old mdx mice received 10 mg/kg/day of the full-spectrum CBD oil for 14 days. We analyzed creatine kinase (CK) levels, liver damage markers, and histopathology of the diaphragm (DIA) and quadriceps (QUA [myonecrotic fibers with positive IgG staining, regenerated fibers/central nuclei, the minimum Feret's diameter, the fibrosis area, the inflammatory area, the presence of macrophages, and NF-kappa B content]).

We hypothesized that GRMD bone measurements would be altered similarly to DMD and would correlate with muscle strength and density. Eighteen variably aged and mixed gender dogs (6 each dystrophic, carrier, normal) were studied by computed tomography (CT) and bone measures were compared with various muscle functional measurements. FL, density, and volume and muscle density of several pelvic limb muscles were assessed. Dystrophic dogs showed some boney and muscle density changes on CT analysis compared to carriers and normal dogs. In GRMD, bone measurements were highly correlated with several other functional outcome measures, including eccentric contraction decrement, hip joint angle, and muscle volume/density.

    "abstract": "Muscle repair and regeneration are complex processes. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), these processes are disrupted by the loss of functional dystrophin, a key part of the transmembrane dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex that stabilizes myofibers, indirectly leading to progressive muscle wasting, subsequent loss of ambulation, respiratory and cardiac insufficiency, and premature death. As part of the DMD pathology, histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity is constitutively increased, leading to epigenetic changes and inhibition of muscle regeneration factors, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and adipogenesis. HDAC inhibition has consequently been investigated as a therapeutic approach for muscular dystrophies that, significantly, works independently from specific genetic mutations, making it potentially suitable for all patients with DMD. This review discusses how HDAC inhibition addresses DMD pathophysiology in a multi-targeted mode of action and summarizes the recent evidence on the rationale for HDAC inhibition with givinostat, which is now approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of DMD in patients aged 6 years and older."

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, the pathological age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, contributes to physical decline, frailty, and diminished healthspan. The impact of sarcopenia is expected to rise as the aging population grows, and treatments remain limited. Therefore, novel approaches for enhancing physical function and strength in older adults are desperately needed. Recent evidence suggests that deficits in motor neuron excitability contribute significantly to age-related weakness. Accordingly, we hypothesized that enhancing motor neuron excitability could be a novel strategy for mitigating age-related declines in physical function and strength. To test this hypothesis, we targeted the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor with an agonist, as this receptor is known to enhance intrinsic excitability and amplify persistent inward currents of motor neurons. We found that a single oral gavage dose of 1.5, 3, and 6 mg/kg lorcaserin, a selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonist, significantly increased indices of motor neuron excitability (e.g., cervical motor evoked potential (cMEP) amplitude by 53-64% and reduced attenuation in cMEP amplitude during repetitive stimulation), along with improvements in motor coordination (22-24% enhancement in rotarod performance) and functional strength (~ 17% increase in max weighted cart pull and 12% increase in grip strength) in aged mice. In contrast, antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors resulted in the opposite effect, reducing cMEP amplitude by ~ 26%, increasing attenuation of cMEP amplitude during repetitive stimulation, and decreasing grip strength by ~ 10% in aged mice. Overall, our findings indicate that enhancing motor neuron excitability via 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonism holds promise as a neurotherapeutic approach to treat age-related motor decline and sarcopenia."

Regression analyses showed a positive correlation between later age at LOA and higher LVEF in adulthood (linear regression estimate 1.49, 95 % CI: 0.13-2.84, p = 0.03). Each additional year of ambulation increased the odds of displaying a higher LVEF category (LVEF 40 %, 40 - 50 % or 50 %) by 35 % (p = 0.003). Sensitivity models excluding cardioprotective genotypes (absence of Dp116 isoform) and mild motor phenotypes (out of frame deletions amenable to skip exon 44 and 45) confirmed this association while models including age at respiratory impairment did not improve the model. Individuals who lost ambulation before age 11.92 (ROC AUC 0.73, 95 % CI: 0.60-0.85) reached a LVEF <40 % 5.21 years earlier than those who lost ambulation after that age (adjusted restricted mean survival time 19.08 vs 24.29 years, p < 0.001). These findings may suggest that prolonging ambulation does not impact cardiac function adversely in advance stages of DMD."

CTLA4-Ig treatment reduced mdx sarcolemma lesions and reduced the numbers of activated T cells, macrophages, and antigen-presenting cells in mdx muscle and reduced macrophage invasion into muscle fibers. In vitro data showed that CTLA4-Ig acts directly on bone marrow cells and macrophages to modify their function and gene expression. CTLA4-Ig treatment of mdx bone marrow cells diminished their mobility and chemotactic response to chemokine ligand-2. Treating mdx macrophages with CTLA4-Ig reduced their cytolysis of muscle cells in vitro. RNA-sequencing analysis of mdx macrophages showed that CTLA4-Ig reduced expression of genes associated with leukocyte chemotaxis, migration, and extravasation; >90% of those affected genes were tumor necrosis factor-α target genes. Comparison of mdx and wild-type macrophages by RNA sequencing showed that 46% of the genes down-regulated by CTLA4-Ig were genes up-regulated in macrophages by the presence of muscular dystrophy in mice. These findings show that CTLA4-Ig is a promising immunotherapeutic for DMD, and many of its beneficial effects may result from direct actions on macrophages that modify their expression of proinflammatory genes."

    "title": "Navigating adulthood: Exploring the transition needs of adolescents and young adults affected by Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "For individuals with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD, respectively), transitioning to adulthood presents significant challenges. Although considerable attention has been given to facilitating medical transitions due to the complexity of these conditions, less focus has been placed on other aspects of the transition, such as achieving independence. This study assessed the transition needs of people with DMD or BMD, exploring various domains including health, education, employment, living arrangements, transportation, daily activities, and independent personal life. Men with DMD or BMD participated in this cross-sectional study. Transition to adulthood was assessed using Transition Readiness Assessment for Young Adults with DMD. The questionnaire evaluates transitions in health care, education and employment, housing and transportation, activities of daily living, and independent life and autonomy. Factors associated with and predicting transition to adulthood were evaluated using Spearman's correlations and multiple regression analysis. Forty-two people with DMD or BMD (mean age: 24.3±5.3) participated in this study. The transition domains in which most participants needed help were education and employment (52.5%) and activities of daily living (57.0%). Transition needs that stood out included palliative care (66.6%), employment and education support (76.1%), social worker consultation for housing assistance (76.1%), and assistive device consultation (64.2%). Mobility and breathing function did not correlate with transition level. Number of siblings positively correlated with and predicted most transition domains. Older age predicted only education and employment status. In conclusion, the analysis showed that the most problematic transition domains among people with DMD or BMD were activities of daily living and education and employment. In most transition domains, help needed did not decrease with age and was not affected by function. However, adolescents and adults with more siblings typically reported being more ready to transit to adult life."

    "abstract": "Eccentric contraction-induced (ECC-induced) force loss is a hallmark of murine dystrophin-deficient (mdx) skeletal muscle that is used to assess efficacy of potential therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. While virtually all key proteins involved in muscle contraction have been implicated in ECC force loss, a unifying mechanism that orchestrates force loss across such diverse molecular targets has not been identified. We showed that correcting defective hydrogen sulfide (H2S) signaling in mdx muscle prevented ECC force loss. We also showed that the cysteine proteome of skeletal muscle functioned as a redox buffer in WT and mdx muscle during ECCs, but that buffer capacity in mdx muscle was significantly compromised by elevated basal protein oxidation. Finally, chemo-proteomic data suggested that H2S protected several proteins central to muscle contraction against irreversible oxidation through persulfidation-based priming. Our results support a unifying, redox-based mechanism of ECC force loss in mdx muscle."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a prevalent, fatal degenerative muscle disease with no effective treatments. Mdx mouse model of DMD exhibits impaired muscle performance, oxidative stress, and dysfunctional autophagy. Although antioxidant treatments may improve the mdx phenotype, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of aminoguanidine hemisulfate (AGH), an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS), on mitochondrial autophagy, oxidative stress, and muscle force in mdx mice. Male wild-type (WT) and mdx mice were divided into three groups: WT, mdx, and AGH-treated mdx mice (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally for two weeks) at 6 weeks of age. Gene expression, western blotting, H&E staining, immunofluorescence, ROS assays, TUNEL apoptosis, glutathione activity, and muscle force measurements were performed. Statistical comparisons used one-way ANOVA. AGH treatment significantly reduced the protein levels of LC3, and p62 in mdx mice, indicating improved autophagy activity and the ability to clear damaged mitochondria. AGH restored the expression of mitophagy-related genes Pink1 and Parkin and increased Mfn1, rebalancing mitochondrial dynamics. It also increased Pgc1α and mtTFA levels, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. ROS levels were reduced, with higher Prdx3 and MnSOD expression, improving mitochondrial antioxidant defenses. AGH normalized the GSSG/GSH ratio and decreased glutathione reductase and peroxidase activities, further improving redox homeostasis. Additionally, AGH reduced apoptosis, shown by fewer TUNEL-positive cells and lower caspase-3 expression. Histological analysis revealed decreased muscle damage and fewer embryonic and neonatal myosin-expressing fibers. AGH altered fiber composition, decreasing MyH7 while increasing MyH4 and MyH2. Muscle force improved significantly, with greater twitch and tetanic forces. Mechanistically, AGH modulated the AKT/FOXO1 pathway, decreasing myogenin and Foxo1 while increasing MyoD. AGH treatment restored mitochondrial autophagy, reduced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and altered muscle fiber composition via the AKT/FOXO1 pathway, collectively improving muscle force in mdx mice. We propose AGH as a potential therapeutic strategy for DMD and related muscle disorders."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations of the dystrophin gene, which spans 2.4 Mb on the X chromosome. Creatine kinase (CK) activity in blood and titin fragment levels in urine have been identified as biomarkers in DMD to monitor disease progression and evaluate therapeutic intervention. However, the difference in the sensitivity of these biomarkers in DMD remains unclear. Previously, we generated transchromosomic mice carrying the full-length human dystrophin gene on a human artificial chromosome (DYS-HAC1) vector. The human dystrophin derived from DYS-HAC1 improved pathological phenotypes observed in DMD-null mice, which lack the entire 2.4 Mb of the dystrophin gene. In this study, we compared the values of plasma CK activity and urine/plasma titin fragment levels in wild-type (WT), DYS-HAC1, DMD-null, and DYS-HAC1; DMD-null mice. Plasma CK activity and urine/plasma titin fragment levels in DMD-null mice were significantly higher than those in WT mice. Although plasma CK activity showed no significant difference between WT and DYS-HAC1; DMD-null mice, urine/plasma titin fragment levels in DYS-HAC1; DMD-null mice were higher than those in WT mice. Human dystrophin in DYS-HAC1; DMD-null mice drastically improved muscular dystrophy phenotypes seen in DMD-null mice; however, the proportion of myofibers with central nuclei in DYS-HAC1; DMD-null mice had a tendency to be slightly higher than that in WT mice. These results suggest that urine/plasma titin fragment levels could be a more sensitive biomarker than plasma CK activity."

    "title": "The Effect of Genotype Differences on Cardiac Involvement in Cases Diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequently seen muscular disease in childhood. Cardiac involvement is extremely important in terms of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Different studies have shown that mutations occurring in various exons are cardioprotective or increase cardiac involvement in DMD cases. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of genotype differences on cardiac involvement in patients diagnosed with DMD with genetic analysis. A retrospective analysis of DMD patients followed up in the Muscle Diseases Centre of Health Sciences University Izmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital was done. Evaluation was made of 120 male DMD patients with a mean age of 9.66 ± 5.10 years. According to the genetic analysis results, 76.7% deletions, 15.8% mutations, and 7.5% duplications were determined. Of the mutations determined, 65.8% were between exons 44 and 54, 17.5% between exons 1 and 18, and 9.2% between exons 19 and 43, 5.8% were non-sense mutations, and 1.7% were on exons >54. In the cases determined with cardiac involvement, the mean age of onset was 11.87 ± 3.11 years. When ejection fraction (EF) <56% or fractional shortening (FS) <28% was accepted as systolic dysfunction cardiac effect, 12.5% of the cases were determined with cardiac involvement. Of the cases determined with cardiac effects, 86.7% were aged >10 years. Electrocardiography was evaluated as normal in 54.5%, sinus tachycardia in 24.2%, short PR in 15.2%, and right and left ventricle hypertrophy in 8.1%. No statistically significant difference was determined in mutation types and location according to the age of cardiac involvement. The left ventricle (LV) posterior wall thickness value determined in the exon 44-54 group was higher than in DMD cases with other mutations. Although not statistically significant, an important result was that the LV posterior wall and IVSed values were evaluated to be high. The current study results and findings in literature have not found a clear relationship between genotypes and cardiac involvement in DMD cases."

    "abstract": "To observe the prevalence of impaired pulmonary function during various phases of the disease course in children aged 5-18 y with dystrophinopathy. The correlation between different parameters of pulmonary dysfunction and motor function was also studied. One hundred and thirty-three confirmed cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), fulfilling predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated. A pulmonary function test, the six-minute walk test (6MWT), and a functional assessment of muscular strength using the Vignos and Brooke functional scale were performed on all children. Pulmonary dysfunction was defined as < 80% of the predicted forced vital capacity (FVC). The overall prevalence of pulmonary dysfunction was 48.12% (95% CI: 39.8-56.54). The prevalence (95% CI) of pulmonary dysfunction in age groups 5-7.5 y, 7.5-10 y, and 10-18 y was 50% (33.63-66.37), 39.29% (27.58-52.37), and 57.78% (43.3-71.03) respectively. There was a significant association of mean walk duration (r = 0.2509; p = 0.019), walk distance (r = 0.21; p = 0.028), Brooke functional score (r = -0.30; p = 0.0006), and Vignos functional score (r = -0.21; p = 0.019) with percentage predicted FVC. Children with deletion of R17, 18 and 19 spectrin-like repeats were found to have a significantly high proportion of pulmonary dysfunction (p = 0.006). No statistically significant differences were found between children with a deletion involving ABD or hinge region 3 and those without. Impaired pulmonary function can be seen quite early in the disease course, and its prevalence is comparable to those of children with a long-standing disease."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration in adults is predominantly driven by satellite cells. Loss of satellite cell pool and function leads to skeletal muscle wasting in many conditions and disease states. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are increased in satellite cells after muscle injury. Conditional ablation of Fn14 in Pax7-expressing satellite cells drastically reduces their expansion and skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Fn14 is required for satellite cell self-renewal and proliferation as well as to prevent precocious differentiation. Targeted deletion of Fn14 inhibits Notch signaling but leads to the spurious activation of STAT3 signaling in regenerating skeletal muscle and in cultured muscle progenitor cells. Silencing of STAT3 improves proliferation and inhibits premature differentiation of Fn14-deficient satellite cells. Furthermore, conditional ablation of Fn14 in satellite cells exacerbates myopathy in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) whereas its overexpression improves the engraftment of exogenous muscle progenitor cells into the dystrophic muscle of mdx mice. Altogether, our study highlights the crucial role of Fn14 in the regulation of satellite cell fate and function and suggests that Fn14 can be a potential molecular target to improve muscle regeneration in muscular disorders."

    "abstract": "DUX4 is typically a repressed transcription factor, but its aberrant activation in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) leads to cell death by disrupting muscle homeostasis. This disruption affects crucial processes such as myogenesis, sarcolemma integrity, gene regulation, oxidative stress, immune response, and many other biological pathways. Notably, these disrupted processes have been associated, in other pathological contexts, with the presence of connexin (Cx) hemichannels-transmembrane structures that mediate communication between the intracellular and extracellular environments. Thus, hemichannels have been implicated in skeletal muscle atrophy, as observed in human biopsies and animal models of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, and Dysferlinopathies, suggesting a potentially shared mechanism of muscle atrophy that has not yet been explored in FSHD. Despite various therapeutic strategies proposed to manage FSHD, no treatment or cure is currently available. This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying FSHD progression, with a focus on hormones, inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial function. Additionally, it explores the potential of targeting hemichannels as a therapeutic strategy to slow disease progression by preventing the spread of pathogenic factors between muscle cells."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked genetic disorder caused by an array of mutations in the dystrophin gene, with the most commonly mutated regions being exons 48-55. One of the several existing approaches to treat DMD is gene therapy, based on alternative splicing and mutant exon skipping. Testing of such therapy requires animal models that carry mutations homologous to those found in human patients. Here, we report the generation of two genetically modified mouse lines, named \"insT\" and \"insG\", with distinct mutations at the same position in exon 51 that lead to a frameshift, presumably causing protein truncation. Hemizygous males of both lines exhibit classical signs of muscular dystrophy in all muscle tissues except for the cardiac tissue. However, pathological changes are more pronounced in one of the lines. Membrane localization of the protein is reduced to the point of absence in one of the lines. Moreover, an increase in full-length isoform mRNA was detected in diaphragms of insG line mice. Although further work is needed to qualify these mutations as sole origins of dissimilarity, both genetically modified mouse lines are suitable models of DMD and can be used to test gene therapy based on alternative splicing."

We demonstrate that AuNPs conjugation to an aptamer against α7/β1 integrin dimers directs either local or systemic delivery of microRNA-206 to MuSCs, thereby promoting muscle regeneration and improving muscle functionality, in a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. We show here that this platform is biocompatible, non-toxic, and non-immunogenic, and it can be easily adapted for the release of a wide range of therapeutic oligonucleotides into diseased muscles."

Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping offers potential by partially restoring dystrophin, though current therapies remain mutation specific with limited efficacy. To overcome those limitations, we developed brogidirsen, a dual-targeting ASO composed of two directly connected 12-mer sequences targeting exon 44 using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. An open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 trial assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of brogidirsen in six ambulant patients with DMD amenable to exon 44 skipping. Following dose escalation, extended 24-week treatment with 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg yielded dose-dependent increases in dystrophin (16.63% and 24.47% of normal). Functional assessments indicated motor stabilization, and plasma proteomics revealed reductions in peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), titin (TTN), and myomesin 2 (MYOM2), highlighting potential biomarkers. Brogidirsen's efficacy was supported in vitro using urine-derived cells from patients with DMD. These promising results warrant a subsequent trial for DMD.

To establish the height growth curve of early DMD, and evaluate the potential influencing markers on height growth, provide further evidence for pathological mechanism, height growth management and bone health in DMD. A retrospective, cross-sectional study of 348 participants with DMD aged 2-12 years was conducted at West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2023 to October 2023. The growth curve for 2-12 years old boys with DMD indicates a slower growth rate compared to the average population. At age two, children with DMD have a similar height to their peers, but gradually falls behind afterwards. Short stature was observed in children with DMD before and after GC exposure, and prolonged GC use exacerbated the retardation. BMI (β = -0.47, p = 0.007), BMD (β = -0.005, p = 0.014), β-CTX (β = 0.001, p = 0.002), delayed BA (β = 0.417, p < .001), GC duration (β = -0.006, p = 0.047) were independent influencing factors of height. Relevant bone health markers showed different sequential changing patterns. The high proportion and progression of short stature are associated with the broad bone health status. Different bone indicators have different sensitivities and specificities and need to be considered together for clinical monitoring of bone health. This study provides evidence for the early monitoring of height development and relevant factors as part of bone health management in DMD, to minimize the occurrence of bone-related complications later in life."

    "abstract": "Absence of the structural protein, dystrophin, results in the neuromuscular disorder Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). In addition to progressive skeletal muscle dysfunction, this multisystemic disorder can also result in cognitive deficits and behavioural changes that are likely to be consequences of dystrophin loss from central neurons and astrocytes. Dystrophin-deficient mdx mice exhibit decreases in grey matter volume in the hippocampus, the brain region that encodes and consolidates memories, and this is exacerbated with ageing. To understand changes in cellular composition that might underpin these age-related developments, we have compared neurogenesis and the prevalence of immunofluorescently identified newly born and mature neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the dentate gyrus of mdx and wild-type mice at 2, 4, 8 and 16 months of age. The number of adult-born neurons was suppressed in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone of 2-month-old mdx mice. However, the numbers of granule cells and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, alpha 1-expressing cells were similar in wild-type and mdx mice at all ages. Strikingly, the numbers of astrocytes, particularly in the dentate gyrus molecular layer, were suppressed in mdx mice at all time points. Thus, dystrophin loss was associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in early life but did not impact the prevalence of mature neurons across the lifespan of mdx mice. In contrast, normal age-related dentate gyrus astrocyte proliferation was suppressed in dystrophic mice. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain and are crucial in supporting neuronal function, such that loss of these cells is likely to contribute to hippocampal dysfunction reported in mdx mice."

Muscle consists of myofibres of different types and sizes. However, little is known about the fibre type and fibre size tropism of AAV in large mammals. We evaluated fibre type- and size-specific transduction properties of AAV8 and AAV9 in 17 dogs that received systemic gene transfer (dose 1.94 ± 0.52 × 10<sup>14</sup> vg/kg; injected at 2.86 ± 0.30 months; harvested at 20.79 ± 3.30 months). For AAV8, two DMD dogs and three carrier dogs received an alkaline phosphatase (AP) reporter vector, and five DMD dogs received a four-repeat microdystrophin (uDys) vector. For AAV9, one normal and one DMD dog received the AP vector, and five DMD dogs received a five-repeat uDys vector. Association between AAV transduction and the fibre type/size was studied in three muscles that showed mosaic transgene expression, including the biceps femoris, teres major and latissimus dorsi. Transgene expression was detected in 30%-45% of myofibres. In the AP reporter vector-injected dogs, neither AAV8 nor AAV9 showed a statistically significant fibre type preference. Interestingly, AP expression was enriched in smaller fibres. In uDys-treated DMD dogs, slow and fast myofibres were equally transduced. Notably, uDys-expressing myofibres were significantly larger than uDys-negative myofibres irrespective of the AAV serotype (p < 0.0001). In AAV8 uDys vector-injected dogs, the mini-Feret diameter was 15%, 16% and 23% larger in uDys-positive slow, fast and hybrid fibres, respectively; the cross-sectional area was 30%, 34% and 46% larger in uDys-positive slow, fast and hybrid fibres, respectively. In AAV9 uDys vector-injected dogs, the mini-Feret diameter was 12%, 13% and 25% larger in uDys-positive slow, fast and hybrid fibres, respectively; the cross-sectional area was 25%, 28% and 59% larger in uDys-positive slow, fast and hybrid fibres, respectively. Our studies suggest that AAV8 and AAV9 transduce fast and slow myofibres at equivalent efficiency. Importantly, uDys therapy effectively prevented dystrophic myofibre atrophy. Our study provides important insight into systemic muscle AAV delivery in large mammals and supports further development of uDys gene therapy for DMD."

EN001, developed by ENCell, are allogeneic early-passage Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells that originate at the umbilical cord, with preclinical studies demonstrating their high therapeutic efficacy for DMD. This phase 1 clinical trial explored the safety and tolerability of EN001 as a potential treatment option for patients with DMD. Six pediatric participants with DMD were divided into two subgroups of equal size: low-dose EN001 (5.0×10⁵ cells/kg) and high-dose EN001 (2.5×10⁶ cells/kg). All participants were monitored for 12 weeks after EN001 administration to assess its safety. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated across 2 weeks post administration. Exploratory efficacy was evaluated by measuring serum creatine kinase levels, and functional evaluations-including spirometry, myometry, the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, and the 6-minute walk test-were conducted at week 12 and compared with the baseline values. No participants experienced serious adverse events related to EN001 injection during the 12-week follow-up period. Mild adverse events included injection-related local erythema, edema, parosmia, and headache, but DLT was not observed. Functional evaluations at week 12 revealed no significant changes from baseline. These results demonstrated that EN001 are safe and well tolerated for patients with DMD, and did not cause serious adverse events. The efficacy of EN001 could be confirmed through larger-scale future studies that incorporate repeated dosing and have a randomized controlled trial design."

We aimed to determine whether urine titin elevation occurs in the absence of calpain 3. We measured urine titin by ELISA in two genetically confirmed limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type R1(LGMDR1) patients, 11 other LGMD patients, and five healthy controls. Five Capn3-/- and nine wild-type mice were also examined. Urine titin in LGMDR1 patients was ~100-fold higher than in controls (median 112.3 vs. 1.3 pmol/mg Cr, p < 0.0001), with no difference between LGMDR1 and other LGMD subtypes. Similarly, urine titin levels in Capn3-/- mice were more than four times higher than normal (p < 0.01). These results suggest the involvement of other protein-degrading enzymes leading to the production of the N-terminal fragment."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD; MIM #310200) is the most common inherited muscular dystrophy. <b>Methods</b>: We screened datasets of 403 male, genetically confirmed X-linked dystrophinopathy patients and identified 13 pathogenic variants of the <i>DMD</i> gene that have not been described in the literature thus far. For all patients we provide additional data on the clinical course, genotype-phenotype correlations as well as histological datasets of nine patients. In two cases, we used RNA-Seq analyses, showing that this method can be particularly helpful in cases of deep intrinsic variants. <b>Results</b>: We were able to show, that a combination of the different datasets is helpful to counsel families and provides a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. <b>Conclusions</b>: Overall, we elaborated upon the persistent challenge of determining the course of disease from genetic analysis alone, rather supporting the concept of a clinical continuum of dystrophinopathies with our combined clinical, histological and molecular genetic findings."

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that play an essential role in the onset and progression of cancer. As a consequence, a variety of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been developed as potent anticancer agents, several of which have been approved by the FDA for cancer treatment. However, recent accumulated research results have suggested that HDACs are also involved in several other pathophysiological conditions, such as fibrotic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune diseases. Very recently, the HDAC inhibitor givinostat has been approved by the FDA for an indication beyond cancer: the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In recent years, more and more HDACis have been developed as tools to understand the role that HDACs play in various disorders and as a novel therapeutic approach to fight various diseases other than cancer. In the present perspective article, we discuss the development and study of HDACis as anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory agents, covering the period from 2020-2024. We envision that the discovery of selective inhibitors targeting specific HDAC isozymes will allow the elucidation of the role of HDACs in various pathological processes and will lead to the development of promising treatments for such diseases."

    "abstract": "Adiponectin (ApN) is a hormone with potent effects on various tissues. We previously demonstrated its ability to counteract Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe muscle disorder. However, its therapeutic use is limited. AdipoRon, an orally active ApN mimic, offers a promising alternative. While cardiomyopathy is the primary cause of mortality in DMD, the effects of ApN or AdipoRon on dystrophic hearts have not been investigated. Our recent findings demonstrated the significant protective effects of AdipoRon on dystrophic skeletal muscle. In this study, we investigated whether AdipoRon effects could be extended to dystrophic hearts. As cardiomyopathy develops late in mdx mice (DMD mouse model), 14-month-old mdx mice were orally treated for two months with AdipoRon at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day and then compared with untreated mdx and wild-type (WT) controls. Echocardiography revealed cardiac dysfunction and ventricular hypertrophy in mdx mice, which were fully reversed in AdipoRon-treated mice. AdipoRon also reduced markers of cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, hypertrophy, and fibrosis while enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis via ApN receptor-1 and CAMKK2/AMPK pathways. Remarkably, treated mice also showed improved skeletal muscle strength and endurance. By offering protection to both cardiac and skeletal muscles, AdipoRon holds potential as a comprehensive therapeutic strategy for better managing DMD."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies are a group of heterogenic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness, the most common of them being Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in over 50 distinct genes, and many of them are caused by different genetic mechanisms. Currently, none of these diseases have a cure. However, in recent years, significant progress has been made to correct the underlying genetic cause. The clinical development of adeno-associated viral vector-based therapies has simultaneously produced excitement and disappointment in the research community due to the moderate effect, making it clear that new methods of muscle delivery have to be created. Herein, we review the main characteristics of major muscular dystrophies and outline various muscle-targeted delivery methods being explored for genetic medicines."

    "abstract": "Although current treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have proven to be effective in delaying myopathy, there remains a strong need to identify novel targets to develop additional therapies. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early pathological feature of DMD. A fine balance of mitochondrial dynamics (fission and fusion) is crucial to maintain mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle health. Excessive activation of Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission was reported in animal models of DMD. However, whether Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is a viable target for treating myopathy in DMD remains unknown. Here, we treated a D2-mdx model of DMD (9-10 weeks old) with Mdivi-1, a selective Drp1 inhibitor, every other day (i.p. injection) for 5 weeks. We demonstrated that Mdivi-1 effectively improved skeletal muscle strength and reduced serum creatine kinase concentration. Mdivi-1 treatment also effectively inhibited mitochondrial fission regulatory protein markers, Drp1(Ser616) phosphorylation and Fis1 in skeletal muscles from D2-mdx mice, which resulted in reduced content of damaged and fragmented mitochondria. Furthermore, Mdivi-1 treatment attenuated lipid peroxidation product, 4-HNE, in skeletal muscle from D2-mdx mice, which was inversely correlated with muscle grip strength. Finally, we revealed that Mdivi-1 treatment downregulated Alpha 1 Type I Collagen (Col1a1) protein expression, a marker of fibrosis, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression, a marker of inflammation. In summary, these results demonstrate that inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission by Mdivi-1 is effective in improving muscle strength and alleviating muscle damage in D2-mdx mice. These improvements are associated with improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial integrity, leading to attenuated lipid peroxidation."

    "abstract": "Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) manifests progressive muscular dystrophy and non-progressive central nervous disorder. The neural disorder is possibly caused by abnormalities in the developmental period; however, basic research to understand the mechanisms remains underdeveloped. The responsible gene, Dmd (dystrophin), generates multiple products derived from several gene promoters. Here, we aim to characterize the expression of the shortest product, Dp71, during embryonic brain development and to identify its interaction proteins by using Dp71-specific tag-insertion mice. We showed that Dp71 and Dp140 were major dystrophin products significantly detectable in the mouse embryonic brains and Dp71 was the only dystrophin product derived from intron-62 gene promoter in the physiological mouse brains. Although both Dp71f (exon 78-exclusive form) and Dp71d (exon 78-inclusive form) existed in the embryonic brains, Dp71f and Dp71d were dominant forms in the prenatal and postnatal periods, respectively. We histologically found that Dp71 was prominently expressed in the neuroepithelium of the dorsal and medial telencephalon, which gives rise to the primordial cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Deeper analysis using in vitro primary culture verified Dp71 expressions in Nestin-positive neural stem/progenitor, Fabp7-positive radial glia, and Gfap-positive astrocytic cell populations. Interestingly, Dp71 was downregulated upon neuronal differentiation from stem/progenitor cells into TuJ1-positive immature neurons; however, Dp71 became detectable at Gephyrin-positive inhibitory postsynapses within mature neurons. Importantly, interactome analysis revealed dystroglycan, dystrobrevins, and syntrophins as dominant Dp71-partners in the embryonic neural stem/progenitor cells. Thus, the presence of Dp71-dystroglycan macromolecular complex was clearly established at an early stage of embryonic brain development, which sheds light on relations between fetal abnormalities and intellectual disabilities in DMD/BMD."

We also characterized the stages of progression of the disease and determined their potential association with spirometry variables. In this cross-sectional study, we used data obtained from a review of medical records of all pediatric patients (0-18 years old) with DMD seen in a multidisciplinary neuromuscular clinic of a tertiary government hospital from August 2018 until March 2020. Included were 30 patients subdivided into groups according to the stage of disease progression. Overweight (26.7%), obesity (20%), and scoliosis (26.7%) were common among non-ambulatory patients. Only one late ambulatory patient had evidence of ineffective airway clearance. Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, particularly snoring (66.7%) and apnea (6.7%), were common across all disease stages. All patients had normal peripheral oxygen saturation on room air. The mean peak expiratory flow rate was 215.6 (±84) L/min. The mean Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC were 66.2% (±23.7), 67.7% (±23.8), and 97.5 (±3.2), respectively. Among patients with polysomnography results, the average apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) per hour was 3 (±1.6). When patients were compared according to their stage disease progression, however, no significant differences exist. This is the first study on the pulmonary function of Filipino pediatric patients with DMD. Spirometry patterns characteristic of restrictive lung disease were observed. Prospective studies may help identify respiratory variables that significantly correlate with pulmonary function."

The SPIONs are synthesized by the co-precipitation method, and their surfaces are functionalized with L-cysteine to anchor the drugs, considering that the cysteine on the surface of the SPIONs in the solid state dimerizes to form the cystine molecule, creating the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-(Cys)<sub>2</sub>-DFZ and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-(Cys)<sub>2</sub>-IBU systems for <i>in vivo</i> tests. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and magnetic measurements. The results show that the SPIONs have an average crystallite size of about 8 nm in the solid state and a hydrodynamic size of about 120 nm, which is suitable for biological applications in aqueous dispersion. The nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature and spherical-close morphology. In addition, vibrational modes characteristic of the functional groups of the molecules anchored to the surface of the SPIONs are identified. Data from blood tests of <i>mdx</i> mice after seven consecutive days of treatment with nanoparticles confirm the non-toxic nature of the system and show an improvement in DMD, with normal levels of liver and kidney enzymes and a decrease in creatine kinase protein."

It is approved in the US and in other select countries. Two serious adverse event cases of immune-mediated myositis (IMM) were reported in the phase Ib ENDEAVOR trial (NCT04626674). We hypothesized that immune responses to the micro-dystrophin transgene product may have mediated these IMM events. An interferon-gamma ELISpot assay was used to detect T cell responses to delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin peptide pools. ELISpot analysis suggested that IMM resulted from T cell-mediated responses directed against specific micro-dystrophin peptides corresponding to exons 8 and 9 (Case 1) and exon 8 (Case 2) of the DMD gene. In silico epitope mapping based on the patients' HLA-I alleles indicated greater probability for peptides derived from exons 8 and/or 9 to bind HLA-I, providing further evidence that peptides derived from corresponding micro-dystrophin regions may have higher immunogenic potential. Collectively, these data suggest that patients with DMD gene deletions involving exons 8 and/or 9 may be at increased risk of IMM following delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin gene therapy infusion."

    "abstract": "Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload of muscle fibers is one of the factors that secondarily aggravate the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel modulator 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (APB) on skeletal muscle pathology in dystrophin-deficient <i>mdx</i> mice. Mice were randomly divided into six groups: wild type (WT), WT+3 mg/kg APB, WT+10 mg/kg APB, <i>mdx</i>, <i>mdx</i>+3 mg/kg APB, <i>mdx</i>+10 mg/kg APB. APB was administered intraperitoneally daily for 28 days. Finally, we assessed the grip strength and hanging time of mice, the histology and ultrastructure of the quadriceps, as well as the parameters reflecting quadricep mitochondrial function. 3 mg/kg APB was shown to reduce creatine kinase activity in the serum, intensity of degeneration and the level of fibrosis in the quadriceps of <i>mdx</i> mice, and improved tissue ultrastructure. However, this effect of APB was not sufficient to improve grip strength and hanging time of <i>mdx</i> mice. The effect of 3 mg/kg APB may be due to improve Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in skeletal muscles, as evidenced by a trend toward decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload of quadricep mitochondria. High dose of APB (10 mg/kg body weight) showed less pronounced effect on the pathological phenotype of <i>mdx</i> mice. Moreover, 10 mg/kg APB disrupted the ultrastructure of the quadriceps and caused a decrease in grip strength in WT mice. APB is able to improve the phenotype in <i>mdx</i> mouse DMD model. However, the effect of APB is quite limited, which may be due to its multitargeting of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the membranes of muscle fibers and intracellular organelles, differentially expressed in DMD."

    "abstract": "Extreme heterogeneity exists in the hypersensitive stress response exhibited by the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Because stress hypersensitivity can impact dystrophic phenotypes, this research aimed to understand the peripheral pathways driving this inter-individual variability. Male and female mdx mice were phenotypically stratified into \"stress-resistant\" or \"stress-sensitive\" groups based on their response to two laboratory stressors. Quantitative proteomics of striated muscle revealed that stress-resistant females were most dissimilar from all other groups, with over 250 proteins differentially regulated with stress hypersensitivity. Males showed less proteomic variation with stress hypersensitivity; however, these changes were associated with pathway enrichment. In the heart, stress-sensitive males had significant enrichment of pathways related to mitochondrial ATP synthesis, suggesting that increased cardio-metabolic capacity is associated with stress hypersensitivity in male mdx mice. In both sexes, stress hypersensitivity was associated with greater expression of beta-actin-like protein 2, indicative of altered cytoskeletal organisation. Despite identifying proteomic signatures associated with stress hypersensitivity, these did not correlate with differences in the serum metabolome acutely after a stressor. These data suggest that the heterogeneity in stress hypersensitivity in mdx mice is partially driven by cytoskeletal organisation, but that sex-specific cardio-metabolic reprogramming may also underpin this phenotype. SIGNIFICANCE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle wasting disease which is associated with a premature loss of ambulation and neurocognitive dysfunction. The hypersensitive stress response in DMD is a heterogeneous phenotype which is poorly understood. This study provided the first investigation of the peripheral mechanisms regulating the hypersensitive stress response by undertaking multi-omics analysis of phenotypically stratified mdx mice. Variations in behaviour and the striated muscle proteomic profiles suggest that cardio-metabolic remodelling and cytoskeletal organisation may contribute to this phenotype. This research offers significant insights into understanding how peripheral dystrophin deficiency relates to the cognitive abnormalities seen in patients with DMD."

Therefore, better indicators of myocardial dysfunction are needed for longitudinal (with time) assessment and treatment of DMDAC patients. This study evaluates non-invasive LV PV loop-derived elastance, contractility and efficiency in relation to EF for patients developing DMDAC. The current retrospective study includes thirty DMDAC patients who underwent two serial CMR imaging from 2014 to 2023. The patients were divided into EF < 55% and EF ≥ 55%. Brachial pressures from cuff sphygmomanometer and CMR short axis steady-state free-precession images for the LV were acquired, and a non-invasive PV loop algorithm based on temporal elastance was used to derive mean elastance, contractility, and efficiency. While mean elastance and contractility showed moderate correlations (r = 0.56, p < 0.01, and r = 0.65, p < 0.001 respectively), efficiency exhibited a strong correlation with EF (r = 0.97, p < 0.01). Importantly, mean elastance, efficiency, and contractility were significantly lower in the EF < 55% group compared to EF ≥ 55% (p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive muscle wasting that leads to diminished lifespan. In addition to the inherent weakness of dystrophin-deficient muscle, the dysfunction of resident muscle stem cells (MuSC) significantly contributes to disease progression. Using the mdx mouse model of DMD, we performed an in-depth characterization of disease progression and MuSC function in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle using immunohistology, isometric force measurements, transcriptomic analysis and transplantation assays. We examined the architectural and functional changes in mdx skeletal muscle from 13 and 52 weeks of age and following acute cardiotoxin (CTX) injury. We also studied MuSC dynamics and function under homeostatic conditions, during regeneration post-acute injury, and following engraftment using a combination of histological and transcriptomic analyses. Dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle undergoes progressive changes with age and delayed regeneration in response to acute injury. Muscle hypertrophy, deposition of collagen and an increase in small myofibres occur with age in the tibialis anterior (TA) and diaphragm muscles in mdx mice. Dystrophic mdx mouse TA muscles become hypertrophic with age, whereas diaphragm atrophy is evident in 1-year-old mdx mice. Maximum tetanic force is comparable between genotypes in the TA, but maximum specific force is reduced by up to 38% between 13 and 52 weeks in the mdx mouse. Following acute injury, myofibre hyperplasia and hypotrophy and delayed recovery of maximum tetanic force occur in the mdx TA. We also find defective MuSC polarity and reduced numbers of myocytes in mdx muscle following acute injury. We observed a 50% and 30% decrease in PAX7<sup>+</sup> and MYOG<sup>+</sup> cells, respectively, at 5 days post CTX injury (5 dpi) in the mdx TA. A similar decrease in mdx progenitor cell proportion is observed by single cell RNA sequencing of myogenic cells at 5 dpi. The global expression of commitment-related genes is also reduced at 5 dpi. We find a 46% reduction in polarized PARD3 in mdx MuSCs. Finally, mdx MuSCs exhibit elevated PAX7<sup>+</sup> cell engraftment with significantly fewer donor-derived myonuclei in regenerated myofibres. Our study provides evidence that dystrophin deficiency in MuSCs and myofibres together contributes to progression of DMD. Ongoing muscle damage stimulates MuSC activation; however, aberrant intrinsic MuSC polarity and stem cell commitment deficits due to the loss of dystrophin impair muscle regeneration. Our study provides in vivo validation that dystrophin-deficient MuSCs undergo fewer asymmetric cell divisions, instead favouring symmetric expansion."

In this study, we performed cross-sectional surveys using large-scale patient and caregiver data to identify the prevalence and average impact of symptoms and symptomatic themes experienced by adults with AD, MCI, and dementia. Subsequent analyses were used to determine which demographic and disease-specific factors are associated with more severe disease. Fifteen adults with AD (6), MCI (8), and dementia (1) and 15 caregivers of adults with AD (7), MCI (6), and dementia (2) participated in qualitative interviews providing 1,166 and 1,097 unique quotes pertaining to symptom burden. Using open-ended questions from a comprehensive interview guide, participants were asked to identify the symptoms of AD that have the greatest effect on their lives or the lives of the individual for whom they provide care. A cross-sectional survey was then implemented inquiring about the potential symptoms of importance identified during preliminary qualitative interviews. Four-hundred thirty-three individuals (patients and caregivers) participated in the cross-sectional survey, providing more than 35,000 symptom rating responses. Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine how demographic and disease-specific characteristics correlate with symptomatic theme prevalence. The most frequent symptomatic themes reported by individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia in the cross-sectional survey were memory problems (99.0%), problems thinking (90.3%), and communication difficulties (80.4%). Patients identified decreased satisfaction in social situations (1.45), fatigue (1.45), and memory problems (1.41) as the most impactful symptomatic themes (range 0-4). Patient-reported symptomatic theme prevalence was strongly associated with the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurologic disability. Individuals with AD, MCI, and dementia experience a variety of symptoms that significantly affect their daily lives. These symptoms, many underrecognized, are of variable importance to individuals with these diseases and may inform potential targets for future therapeutic intervention as well as facilitate the development and validation of disease-specific outcome measures."

Caregivers indicated higher rates of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders than HCPs, including anxiety (50.5% C, n = 112; 17.8% HCP, n = 19), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (32.0% C, n = 73; 15.9% HCP, n = 17), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (25.9% C, n = 57; 11.2% HCP, n = 12), depression (21.6% C, n = 48; 18.7% HCP, n = 20), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (21.0% C, n = 47; 10.3% HCP, n = 11). Results also indicated gaps in the assessment and care of these conditions, including lack of routine screening, reduced access to psychologists and psychiatrists, and lack of clarity amongst HCPs about who should manage neurodevelopmental and psychiatric concerns in those with dystrophinopathy. Closing the identified gaps in assessment, perception, and care will require increased awareness of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions in dystrophinopathy and screening tools to facilitate early identification of these conditions during routine clinical care."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare X-linked neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the <i>DMD</i> gene. This study examined the efficacy and safety of ataluren, the first oral treatment for DMD with nonsense mutations (nmDMD), in patients in the Middle East. This retrospective longitudinal study assessed the outcomes of seven boys with nmDMD who received treatment with ataluren and follow-up at a single center since 2016. The median patient age at treatment initiation was 8.04 years (range: 3.3-9.92), and the median duration of exposure was 3.95 years (interquartile range = 4.42 years). Five patients were still ambulatory at the last follow-up. Ataluren was more effective in individuals with baseline 6-min walking distance (6MWD) ≥300 m, as these patients had smaller declines in 6MWD and North Star Ambulatory Assessment scores. Pulmonary function was well preserved in all patients, with no patients having forced vital capacity <60% at their last follow-up. Six patients maintained normal cardiac function, whereas one patient developed heart failure before starting ataluren treatment. Our results demonstrated both the efficacy and safety of ataluren. Early initiation of ataluren treatment delayed the loss of ambulation and cardiorespiratory milestones."

    "abstract": "Dystrophinopathies - a group of hereditary X-linked neuromuscular diseases characterized by worsening fibrofatty degeneration of skeletal muscles, muscular weakness, low exercise tolerance, as well as orthopedic, cardiovascular and respiratory complications. Study of the effectiveness of physical medical rehabilitation in patients with neuromuscular diseases, evaluation of the influence of external and internal factors on functional capabilities and effectiveness of the conducted rehabilitation are highly relevant. To evaluate the effectiveness of physical medical rehabilitation of patients with dystrophinopathies at the outpatient stages of the disease's course and the influence of anthropometric characteristics and functional status of patients' motor capabilities. The study included 47 patients with genetically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (the 1st group - 32 patients at an early outpatient stage, mean age 7.0±0.2 years; the 2nd group - 15 patients at a late outpatient stage, mean age 9.0±0.2 years) and 17 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) (the 3rd group, mean age 12.0±1.2 years). All patients performed aerobic exercises 3 times a week, the duration of rehabilitation course was 4 months. The distance of 6-minute walk test (6MWT) with fatigue assessment on the visual analogue scale, the speed of rising from the floor with assessment of the functional class on a 6-point scale, the functional capacities on the Motor Function Measure (MFM) scale, dimension D1 (standing and transfers) were evaluated at baseline and after 2 and 4 months. Positive dynamics has been revealed in the form of elongating 6MWT distance, increasing speed of tests for time performance with increase of test's functional class, improvement of motor functions on the MFM scale at the end of case follow-up in the 1st and 3rd groups (<i>p</i><0.01). A high correlation of the patients' motor capabilities with reduction of strength and speed indicators, moderate relationship with age and anthropometric indicators have been found (<i>p</i><0.01). Performance of aerobic exercises without weight combined with exercises on an ergocycle allows to improve motor capabilities in patients with DMD at the early stages and in patients with BMD. Exercising at the late stages of DMD can slow down the disease's progression. The dynamics of motor capabilities' indicators in regular performance of dynamic aerobic exercises are more influenced by the initial functional status, less - by age and concomitant overweight and high body mass index."

    "abstract": "The potential pathogenic role of disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) remains a complex, unsettled issue. We used muscle fibers isolated from 3-mo-old DMDmdx rats to further investigate the case. Most DMDmdx fibers exhibited no sign of trophic or morphology distinction as compared with WT fibers and mitochondria and t-tubule membrane networks also showed no stringent discrepancy. Under voltage clamp, values for holding current were similar in the two groups, whereas values for capacitance were larger in DMDmdx fibers, suggestive of enhanced amount of t-tubule membrane. The Ca2+ current density across the channel carried by the EC coupling voltage sensor (CaV1.1) was unchanged. The maximum rate of voltage-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release was reduced by 25% in the DMDmdx fibers, with no change in voltage dependency. Imaging resting Ca2+ revealed rare spontaneous local SR Ca2+ release events with no sign of elevated activity in DMDmdx fibers. Under current clamp, DMDmdx fibers generated similar trains of action potentials as WT fibers. Results suggest that reduced peak amplitude of SR Ca2+ release is an inherent feature of this DMD model, likely contributing to muscle weakness. This occurs despite a preserved amount of releasable Ca2+ and with no change in excitability, CaV1.1 channel activity, and SR Ca2+ release at rest. Although we cannot exclude that fibers from the 3-mo-old animals do not yet display a fully developed disease phenotype, results provide limited support for pathomechanistic concepts frequently associated with DMD such as membrane fragility, excessive Ca2+ entry, or enhanced SR Ca2+ leak."

    "abstract": "Progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of muscular dystrophies is hindered by the lack of pathophysiologically relevant in vitro models. Here, an entirely scaffold-free anchored cell sheet engineering platform is used to create patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) skeletal muscle in vitro models. This approach effectively replicates mature muscle phenotypes and tissue- and disease-specific extracellular matric (ECM). Models were developed using primary cells from healthy individuals and patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1. Through a combination of quantified histological staining (Hematoxylin & Eosin, Movat's Pentachrome, Masson's Trichrome) and immunostaining (desmin, myosin heavy chain, laminin, and dystrophin), it was demonstrated that the models formed mature constructs closely resembling their respective in vivo conditions. Proteomics analysis revealed that the models exhibited appropriate upregulation and downregulation of disease-relevant pathways. Models of diseased tissues accurately reflected key phenotypic features of the diseases, including alterations in muscle fiber integrity and ECM composition. Upon treatment with therapeutically beneficial drugs, significant changes in their proteomic profiles were documented, highlighting the models' potential for drug screening. This novel in vitro modeling approach, unlike other 3D techniques that rely on exogenous biomaterials that interfere with natural cellular behaviors, provides a promising platform for studying muscular dystrophies."

    "abstract": "The severity of brain comorbidities in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) depends on the mutation position within the DMD gene and differential loss of distinct brain dystrophin isoforms (i.e. Dp427, Dp140, Dp71). Comparative studies of DMD mouse models with different mutation profiles may help to understand this genotype-phenotype relationship. The aim of this study was (1) to compare the phenotypes due to Dp427 loss in mdx5cv mice to those of mdx52 mice, which concomitantly lack Dp427 and Dp140; and (2) to evaluate replicability of phenotypes in separate laboratories. We show that mdx5cv mice displayed impaired fear conditioning and robust anxiety-related responses, the severity of which was higher in mdx52 mice. Depression-related phenotypes presented variably in these models and were difficult to replicate between laboratories. Recognition memory was unaltered or minimally affected in mdx5cv and mdx52 mice, at variance with the cognitive deficits described in the original Dp427-deficient mdx mouse, suggesting a difference related to its distinct genetic background. Our results confirm that Dp140 loss may increase the severity of emotional disturbances, and provide insights on the limits of the reproducibility of behavioral studies in DMD mouse models."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a subsarcolemmal protein whose absence results in increased susceptibility of the muscle fiber membrane to contraction-induced injury. This results in increased calcium influx, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to chronic inflammation, myofiber degeneration, and reduced muscle regenerative capacity. Fast glycolytic muscle fibers have been shown to be more vulnerable to mechanical stress than slow oxidative fibers in both DMD patients and DMD mouse models. Therefore, remodeling skeletal muscle toward a slower, more oxidative phenotype may represent a relevant therapeutic approach to protect dystrophic muscles from deterioration and improve the effectiveness of gene and cell-based therapies. The resistance of slow, oxidative myofibers to DMD pathology is attributed, in part, to their higher expression of Utrophin; there are, however, other characteristics of slow, oxidative fibers that might contribute to their enhanced resistance to injury, including reduced contractile speed, resistance to fatigue, increased capillary density, higher mitochondrial activity, decreased cellular energy requirements. This review focuses on signaling pathways and regulatory factors whose genetic or pharmacologic modulation has been shown to ameliorate the dystrophic pathology in preclinical models of DMD while promoting skeletal muscle fiber transition towards a slower more oxidative phenotype."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of vamorolone, a modified synthetic corticosteroid, for DMD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using seven databases including prospective studies comparing vamorolone with glucocorticosteroids or placebo in DMD patients. We extracted data on efficacy and safety outcomes. We built fixed effects models to assess mean differences. (PROSPERO: CRD42023396908). Out of 210 identified records, two study reports were included in meta-analysis providing data from 210 patients. Vamorolone at 2.0 mg/kg/day was associated with improvement time to climb four stairs velocity (MD = 0.05 95% CI [0.03 to 0.08] P = 0.0002), and time stand from supine velocity (MD = 0.07 95% CI [0.01 to 0.07] P = 0.007). A higher dose of 6.0 mg/kg/day was additionally associated with higher time to run/walk 10 m velocity (MD = 0.10 95% CI [-0.0.1 to 0.21] P = 0.07, I2 = 0%). Among these beneficial effects only improvement in time to climb four stairs velocity was sustained after a follow-up period of 30 months. Vamorolone did not inhibit growth but increased the risk of weight gain, suppression of adrenal function, and insulin resistance. The results of our systematic review and meta-analyis are suggestive of improved efficacy and safety of vamorolone for DMD compared to standard glucocorticosteroids but the external validity of these findings as well as the medication's long-term effects remain to be determined."

MRI data were obtained as part of a clinical study (NCT02310763) of domagrozumab, an antibody-targeting myostatin that negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with Dixon MRI data and corresponding functional data at baseline and weeks 49 and 97. Images were analyzed to evaluate changes in adductors, hamstrings, and quadriceps. There was a positive correlation between increases in LMV and function. LMV changes in adductors (R = 0.51) and quadriceps (R = 0.54) showed a stronger correlation with function than LMV changes in hamstrings (R = 0.30). There was a negative correlation between MFF and MFI, respectively, and function in adductors (R = -0.57, R = -0.42), quadriceps (R = -0.59, R = -0.50), and hamstrings (R = -0.53, R = -048). Participants with preserved North Star Ambulatory Assessment scores had high total LMV (LMV<sub>tot</sub>) and low total MFI (MFI<sub>tot</sub>). Low ratios of LMV<sub>tot</sub> to MFI<sub>tot</sub>, or participants with small LMV<sub>tot</sub> and high MFI<sub>tot</sub>, appeared to have a rapid decline in function and loss of ambulation.

    "abstract": "Dystrophin-deficient zebrafish larvae are a small, genetically tractable vertebrate model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy well suited for early stage therapeutic development. However, current approaches for evaluating their impaired mobility, a physiologically relevant therapeutic target, are characterized by low resolution and high variability. To address this, we used high speed videography and deep learning-based markerless motion capture to develop linked-segment models of larval escape response (ER) swimming. Kinematic models provided repeatable, high precision estimates of larval ER performance. Effect sizes for ER peak instantaneous acceleration and speed, final displacement, and ER distance were 2 to 3.5 standard deviations less for dystrophin-deficient mutants vs. wild-types. Further analysis revealed that mutants swam slower because of a reduction in their tail stroke frequency with little change in tail stroke amplitude. Kinematic variables were highly predictive of the dystrophic phenotype with ≤ 3% of larvae misclassified by random forest and support vector machine models. Tail kinematics also performed as well as <i>in vitro</i> assessments of tail muscle contractility in classifying larvae as mutants or wild-type, suggesting that ER kinematics could serve as a non-lethal proxy for direct measurements of muscle function. In summary, ER kinematics can be used as precise, physiologically relevant, non-lethal biomarkers of the dystrophic phenotype. The open-source approach described here may have applications not only for studies of skeletal muscle disease but for other disciplines that use larval mobility as an experimental outcome."

BMD often has in-frame deletions that preserve the amino acid reading frame, but there are some cases with microvariants or duplications. In recent years, the importance of therapeutic development and care for BMD has been emphasized. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the clinical characteristics of BMD patients with microvariants or duplications and to determine the genotype-phenotype relationship. The study focused on patients with pathogenic microvariants or duplications in <i>DMD</i> who were ambulatory after 16 years of age or had specific muscle biopsy results between June 13, 2017, and March 31, 2023. Informed consent was obtained from the patients or their surrogates. Data concerning <i>DMD</i> variants, muscle biopsy findings, skeletal muscle, respiratory and cardiac function, and CNS involvement were collected and analyzed statistically. Thirty-three patients with BMD had pathogenic microvariants (missense variants, nonsense variants, splice site variants, and other microvariants), and 16 patients had in-frame duplications in <i>DMD</i>. Many patients with microvariants had abnormal ECG findings. The effect of variant type on patient outcomes varied. Regardless of the type of microvariant, skeletal muscle and respiratory dysfunction was more severe in mutants of the cysteine-rich/C-terminal domain than in rod domain mutants. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the complication rate of CNS disorders among the 3 domains of dystrophin. Microvariant forms, in particular, tend to vary in clinical severity according to the site of the dystrophin protein mutation rather than the type of pathogenic variant. The results of this study may be useful for genetic counseling, care, and treatment of patients with BMD."

    "abstract": "New drugs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are emerging rapidly. However, we and others believe these drugs are achieving regulatory approval prematurely. It is the cardiorespiratory complications of DMD that cause the disease's major morbidities and that determine survival. Thus, to be truly effective, a new drug must improve cardiorespiratory function; instead, new drugs are approved for patient use via accelerated regulatory pathways that rely on surrogate outcome measures with unproven clinical benefits (such as tissue levels of non-biologic, truncated dystrophin) and on scales that reflect muscle strength (such as small improvements in timed activities). In DMD, cardiorespiratory complications occur in \"older\" individuals who are in the non-ambulatory stage of the disease. In contrast, accelerated approvals are based on data from young, ambulatory subjects, a group that essentially never experiences cardiorespiratory complications. When drug studies do obtain cardiorespiratory data, their methodologies are suboptimal. We critically review these methodologies in detail, including problems with the use of threshold levels of respiratory function as outcome measures; problems with the use of historical controls, whose results vary widely, and are influenced by uncontrolled variables related to their observational nature; and the limitations of using percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC %pred), and its single rate of decline across a wide range of age and function, as a preferred respiratory outcome measure. We discuss the advantages of an alternative respiratory outcome, the absolute value of FVC with aging (the \"Rideau plot\"). Unlike FVC %pred, the Rideau plot considers distinct phenotypes rather than aggregating all individuals into a single respiratory trajectory. Key features of the Rideau plot can show the nature and timing of a drug's effect on respiratory function, making it a potentially better outcome measure for assessing the respiratory effects of a drug. With this article, we use our respiratory perspective to critically examine the DMD drug development process and to propose improvements in study methodologies and in the regulatory processes that approve new drugs."

Despite the application of initial conservative measures including fasting, enemas, and fluid resuscitation, the obstruction persisted.

Here, we assessed muscle regeneration and function in wild type (WT) and mdx mice where Wnt7a was deleted in muscle using a conditional Wnt7a floxed allele and a Myf5-Cre driver. We found that both WT and mdx mice lacking Wnt7a in muscle, exhibited marked deficiencies in muscle regeneration at 21 d following cardiotoxin (CTX) induced injury. Unlike WT, deletion of Wnt7a in mdx resulted in decreased force generation prior to CTX injury. However, both WT and mdx muscle lacking Wnt7a displayed decreased force generation following CTX injection. Notably the regeneration deficit in mdx mice was rescued by a single tail vein injection of extracellular vesicles containing Wnt7a (Wnt7a-EVs). Therefore, we conclude that the regenerative capacity of muscle in mdx mice is highly dependant on the upregulation of endogenous Wnt7a following injury, and that systemic delivery of Wnt7a-EVs represents a therapeutic strategy for treating DMD."

Brain-related comorbidities show clinical heterogeneity depending on the position of the mutation within the multi-promoter dystrophin (DMD) gene, likely due to the differential impact of mutations on the expression of distinct brain dystrophins. A deficiency of the full-length brain dystrophin, Dp427, has been associated with enhanced stress reactivity, characterized by abnormal fear responses in both patients and mdx mouse model. However, the neural substrates of this phenotype are still unknown. Here, we undertook the first functional imaging study of the mdx mouse brain, following expression of the typical unconditioned fear response expressed by mdx mice after a short scruff restraint and one week later after recovery from stress. We compared the brain glucose metabolism in 12 brain structures of mdx and WT littermate male mice using [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET imaging. Restraint-stress induced a global decrease in [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG uptake in mdx mice, while no difference was found between genotypes when mice were tested one week later under non-stressful conditions. A subset of brain structures were particularly affected by stress in mdx mice, and we identified abnormal correlations between fear responses and metabolism in specific structures, and altered co-activation of the hypothalamus with several subcortical structures. Our data support the hypothesis that enhanced stress reactivity due to loss of brain Dp427 relies on abnormal activation of the brain fear circuit and deregulation of a hypothalamus-dependent pathway."

    "title": "Prevalence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Italy: a nationwide survey.",
    "abstract": "The availability of care recommendations has improved survival and delayed the progression of clinical signs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The aim of the study was to perform a nationwide survey investigating the prevalence, age distribution, and functional status of Duchenne muscular dystrophyin Italy. The survey was performed by collecting data from all 31 reference centers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Italy using a structured form. We assessed age distribution, motor function, and the need for respiratory and nutritional support to evaluate their prevalence in different age and functional subgroups. The estimated prevalence was 1.65/100,000 (3.4/100,000 males). There were 972 boys and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne, of age ranging between 6 months and 48 years (mean = 16.5). Over 59% were below the age of 18 years and the remaining 41% were adults. Over 43% were ambulant and 57% non-ambulant; 14.7% were steroids naive (mean 20.6 years), 75% are currently on steroids (mean 14.6 years) with 604 on the daily regime, 126 intermittent. Nearly 73% did not require any ventilatory support, 16% had NIV ≤ 12 h, 9% > 12 h, and 1.4% had a tracheostomy. More than 82% did not require any nutritional support, 13% required food modification/semisolid and 4.4% had a G-tube. Our findings provide information to be used not only for epidemiological purposes but also for possible trial design to include older non-ambulant patients who until recently have been excluded and for whom clinical information is limited. What is Known • Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a progressive disorder associated with reduced survival. • As part of the disorder there is also a progressive loss of important milestones, including loss of ambulation, and increased need for respiratory and nutritional support. What is New • Our nationwide survey provides prevalence, age distribution, and functional status for Duchenne muscular dystrophyin Italy including both boys and adults. • Our findings can be used for epidemiological purposes and for possible trial design."

    "title": "Muscle Pathology Associated With Cardiac Function in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "To compare the progression of muscle fibrosis of various site and its relation between cardiac deterioration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study aimed to examine the associations between echocardiogram-based cardiac function indices and fibrosis of the abdominal and lower extremity muscles in patients with DMD to facilitate early detection of cardiac dysfunction and identify its predictors. Twenty-one patients with DMD patients were enrolled in the study. The association between cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis of the abdominal and lower extremity muscles was determined by analyzing the echocardiography and elastography. Non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to examine the pairwise relationships between cardiac function and muscle elasticity. All patients were male and non-ambulant. Their mean age was 18.45±4.28 years. The strain ratios of the abdominal muscle and quadriceps muscles were significantly higher than those of the medial gastrocnemius. The strain ratio of the rectus abdominis muscle has a significant negative correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction. Cardiac function and valvular insufficiency were not significantly correlated with muscle strain ratio. According to the result of our study, the only skeletal muscle which showed significant correlation with cardiac dysfunction was degree abdominal muscle fibrosis. The degree of fibrosis of respiratory muscles was also significantly associated with cardiac dysfunction; therefore, it can be used as a predictor of cardiac dysfunction in patients with DMD in clinical practice."

    "title": "Genomic insights into Duchene muscular dystrophy: Analysis of 1250 patients reveals 30% novel genetic patterns and 6 novel variants.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is the most common type of muscular dystrophy, together with Becker muscular dystrophy represent more than half of all cases. DMD is a single-gene, X-linked recessive disorder that predominantly affects boys, causing progressive muscle deterioration and eventually leading to fatal cardiopulmonary complications. This study aimed to implement a cost-effective molecular diagnostic method using the SALSA MLPA Kit (probe mixes 034 and 035) to screen a large group of Egyptian DMD patients. The study included 1250 clinically diagnosed DMD males, following complete family history, pedigree analyses and an accurate clinical examination and laboratory investigations mainly considering high levels of creatine phosphokinase (>2000 U/L). We also analysed the carrier status of 100 mothers of 100 probands to gauge the inherited mutation through their patients with familial disease. The negative results of MLPA were further analysed with NGS for ten patients and the results were validated for novel missense mutations, phenotype-genotype correlations were analysed using PolyPhen2 and mutation taster. Results SALSA MLPA analysis confirmed the diagnoses in 733/1250 (58.6 %) DMD patients and the remaining of 517/1250 (41.4%) were negative. DMD patients having large deletions were 632/1250 (50.6%) while duplications occurred in 101/1250 (8%). The most common single exon deletion was 45 (50/632, 7.9%). In addition, 163 different deletion and duplication patterns were characterized among positive MLPA analyses. 30% of our studied cohort exhibited new patterns of rearragements in addition to seven cases of double deletion and duplication rearrangements identified, within nine patients. Using NGS, for small mutations detection, revealed six novel and three previously reported mutations among screened ten patients. In conclusion, our findings expand the spectrum of known DMD mutations by offering an effective diagnostic method and identifying novel point mutations through NGS analysis. We recommend using NGS to uncover uncharacterized mutations in patients who test negative with MLPA, which could contribute to the treatment of DMD."

    "title": "Prognostic significance of ACTN3 genotype in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Findings from an Argentine patient cohort.",
    "abstract": "A wide phenotypic spectrum exists among DMD patients, with genetic modifiers seen as a putative cause of this variability. The main aim was to evaluate the effect of 4 genetic modifiers and the location of DMD variants on disease severity in a DMD Argentine cohort. A secondary objective was to provide a summary of the current state of knowledge and association of the tested loci with DMD's phenotype. Two groups of patients with extreme phenotypes (Severe/Mild) were defined based on the age at loss of ambulation. SNVs in SPP1, LTBP4, CD40, and ACTN3 were genotyped, and their distribution was compared between groups using Chi-square or Fisher exact tests. Concurrent effects with glucocorticoids treatment, DMD mutation location (proximal/distal) and the other loci were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Additionally, we performed a systematic literature review to summarize and interpret the impact of modifiers on various DMD traits. ACTN3-rs1815739 was the only modifier loci of DMD progression in our cohort. A concurrent damaging effect between DMD mutation and ACTN3 was detected, identifying a possible interaction between distal variants and ACTN3 TT-genotype that need to be validated in a larger cohort. The systematic review showed agreement in the results when significant differences were reported. The employment of extreme DMD phenotypic groups was an innovative approach for identifying risk loci for disease severity. The interaction between DMD mutation location and ACTN3, if confirmed, could help to avoid confounding elements in assembling study cohorts for clinical trials. Finally, this report's major highlight is being the first study conducted on an Argentine and Latin-American population."

    "title": "The role of dystrophin isoforms and interactors in the brain.",
    "abstract": "Dystrophin is a protein crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of skeletal muscle. So far, attention has been focused on the role of dystrophin in muscle, in view of the devastating progression of weakness and early death that characterizes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, in the last few years, the role of shorter dystrophin isoforms, including development and adult expression-specific mechanisms, has been a greater focus. Within the cerebral landscape, various cell types, such as glia, oligodendrocytes and Purkinje, cerebellar granule and vascular-associated cells express a spectrum of dystrophin isoforms, including Dp427, Dp140, Dp71 and Dp40. The interaction of these isoforms with a multitude of proteins suggests their involvement in neurotransmission, influencing several circuit functions. This review presents the intricate interactions among dystrophin isoforms and diverse protein complexes across different cell types and brain regions, as well as the associated clinical complications. We focus on studies investigating protein interactions with dystrophin in the past 30 years at a biochemical level. In essence, the brain's dystrophin landscape is a thrilling exploration of diversity, challenging preconceptions and opening new avenues for understanding CNS physiology. It also holds potential therapeutic implications for neurological complications involving brain dystrophin deficiency. By revealing the molecular complexities related to dystrophin, this review paves the way for future investigations and therapeutic interventions for this CNS aspect of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

    "title": "Poor bone health in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a multifactorial problem beyond corticosteroids and loss of ambulation.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, fatal muscle wasting disease caused by X-linked mutations in the dystrophin gene. Alongside the characteristic muscle weakness, patients face a myriad of skeletal complications, including osteoporosis/osteopenia, high susceptibility to vertebral and long bone fractures, fat embolism post-fracture, scoliosis, and growth retardation. Those skeletal abnormalities significantly compromise quality of life and are sometimes life-threatening. These issues were traditionally attributed to loss of ambulation and chronic corticosteroid use, but recent investigations have unveiled a more intricate etiology. Factors such as vitamin D deficiency, hormonal imbalances, systemic inflammation, myokine release from dystrophic muscle, and vascular dysfunction are emerging as significant contributors as well. This expanded understanding illuminates the multifaceted pathogenesis underlying skeletal issues in DMD. Present therapeutic options are limited and lack specificity. Advancements in understanding the pathophysiology of bone complications in DMD will offer promising avenues for novel treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of factors contributing to bone problems in DMD and delineate contemporary and prospective multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality<sup>1,2</sup>. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC)<sup>3-9</sup>. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan's juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin's ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin's WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement."

Targeted <i>DMD</i> gene, gene panels, exomes and genome sequencing have advanced genetic diagnostics, yet some cases remain elusive. We performed total RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on muscle biopsy from 13 male patients with a clinical diagnosis of DMD/BMD. Splice aberration events are evaluated using the Integrative Genomics Viewers. Targeted DNA sequencing result was used/re-analysed to confirm complex rearrangement events identified. RNAseq identified aberration splicing or expression events in the <i>DMD</i> gene of 12 cases. Splice-altering intronic single nucleotide variant events including c.7309+5G>T, c.7309+5G>A, c.3276+1G>A and c.3603+820G>T were identified in four cases. Splice-altering events were also detected in one case with small indel c.94-38_94del and two cases with intragenic deletions (exons 51-52 and 45-47 deletions). Furthermore, complex DNA rearrangements inducing aberration splicing/expression events were identified in five cases involving exons 44-45, 55-56, 2-79, 45-79 or 68-79, which were concordant with their DNA sequencing reanalysis results. Some cases with exon deletions have presented non-canonical transcripts expression. The RNAseq result showing aberrant splicing/expression in different exon regions in most of these cases corresponded with their immunohistochemical dystrophin staining results and/or clinical symptoms. Our data demonstrated RNAseq is a powerful tool to provide functional data for <i>DMD</i> splice aberration events, especially when integrating with immunohistochemical testing and DNA sequencing, for elucidating the pathogenicity of <i>DMD</i> variants and achieving a precise genetic diagnosis in patients with DMD/BMD clinical presentation but without definitive diagnoses after routine genetic testing."

This study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the 6-min pegboard and ring test (6PBRT) as a practical tool for this purpose. Children with DMD (n = 22) were evaluated using the 6PBRT for UE functional capacity, the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Q-DASH) for functionality, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) for quality of life, and a dynamometer for handgrip strength and UE muscle strength. The 6PBRT showed excellent test-retest reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.978 (95% confidence interval, 0.946-0.984). A very strong positive correlation was observed between the test and retest 6PBRT mean scores (r = 0.981). The mean 6PBRT score exhibited moderate-to-strong correlations with handgrip strength (r = 0.653, r = 0.646, right/left, respectively), muscle strength (shoulder flexors [r = 0.793, r = 0.797, right/left, respectively], shoulder abductors (r = 0.763, r = 0.743, right/left, respectively), elbow flexors [r = 0.743, r = 0.755, right/left, respectively]), mean Q-DASH score (r = -0.555), and mean PedsQL score (r = 0.611). The 6PBRT appears to be a valid and reliable measure for assessing upper extremity functional capacity in patients with DMD. This test is suitable for patients who are able to lift both hands above their heads. NCT06174025."

    "abstract": "Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressing muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis, caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin protein. Different from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), in which dystrophin is completely absent in muscle tissue, while in BMD, the dystrophin gene can express some protein, but not enough. It has also been shown that a proportion of patients with DMD suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the use of the stimulant methylphenidate has been suggested for the treatment of patients with DMD in combination with ADHD. However, there are no case reports on the treatment of co-occurring ADHD in BMD. The patient was a 9-year-old boy who presented with elevated serum creatine kinase levels and inattention. The magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh muscles of both lower limbs suggested partial fatty infiltration of the gluteus maximus muscle bilaterally, and a novel heterozygous mutation (c.31 + 6 T > C) was identified in the DMD gene by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and the sequencing results were verified by using the Sanger method. The child was also diagnosed with co-morbid ADHD after a thorough evaluation and considering this new diagnosis, we started treatment with methylphenidate at a dose of 18 mg/day, and after 6 months of treatment, he showed a significant improvement in his attention span. We identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the DMD gene, which will expand the spectrum of pathogenic variants in BMD. Simultaneously, methylphenidate treatment significantly improved attention in children with BMD co-morbid with ADHD, and this study provides value for future therapeutic protocols for BMD combined with ADHD. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only reported case report on the treatment of BMD co-morbid ADHD. So further studies are needed to determine the interrelationship between these disorders and their treatment."

In this study, we investigated arginine-modified hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (R-HAp) as a novel non-viral vector for DMD gene therapy, particularly for delivering the large 18.8 kb dystrophin gene. Addressing the limitations of traditional adeno-associated viral vectors, R-HAp demonstrated efficient binding and delivery of the dystrophin plasmid to DMD patient-derived skeletal muscle cells. Using confocal imaging and RT-PCR analysis, our results showed effective gene delivery and expression in both mouse myotubes and patient-derived cells, with sustained expression evident up to 5 days post transfection. The patient-derived myotubes also showed dystrophin protein production 7 days post transfection. These findings suggest R-HAp nanoparticles as a promising and cost-effective alternative for DMD treatment, highlighting their potential for overcoming current gene therapy challenges."

Whether MuSCs have intrinsic defects or are disrupted by their environment is unclear. We investigated cell behavior and gene expression of MuSCs from DMD or healthy human muscles. Proliferation, differentiation, and fusion were unaltered in DMD-MuSCs, but with time, they lost their myogenic identity twice as fast as healthy MuSCs. The rapid drift toward a fibroblast-like cell identity was observed at the clonal level, and resulted from altered expression of epigenetic enzymes. Re-expression of <i>CBX3</i>, <i>SMC3</i>, <i>H2AFV</i>, and <i>H3F3B</i> prevented the MuSC identity drift. Among epigenetic changes, a closing of chromatin at the transcription factor <i>MEF2B</i> locus caused downregulation of its expression and loss of the myogenic fate. Re-expression of MEF2B in DMD-MuSCs restored their myogenic fate. MEF2B is key in the maintenance of myogenic identity in human MuSCs, which is altered in DMD."

    "abstract": "The development of the testes is a tightly regulated process, requiring the coordination of multiple genes. Mutations in these genes can result in 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. <i>NR0B1</i>, located at Xp21, is a gene expressed in the developing adrenals, gonads, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland. Duplication of this area causes dosage sensitive male-to-female sex reversal and involves multisystem abnormalities. The heterogeneity in clinical phenotypes is attributed to variations in the size of the duplicated segments. Herein, we present a case with 46,XY disorders of sex development and muscular dystrophy due to Xp21 duplication. A 5-month-old boy was admitted to our hospital due to gonadal dysgenesis. The patient was born to a healthy couple after 37+4 weeks of pregnancy and with a natural delivery. In the course of the disease, the child showed marked growth retardation, elevated muscle enzymes and liver enzymes. During the follow-up, he developed hypotonia and low muscle strength. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) testing uncovered a 7.79 Mb duplication at Xp21 in both the patient and his mother, encompassing 30 coding genes, including the <i>NR0B1</i> and <i>DMD</i> genes. The duplication of Xp21 can result in a rare genetic disorder characterized by various abnormalities in males, including short stature, mental retardation, muscular dystrophy, and gonadal dysplasia. These symptoms are often overlooked and misdiagnosed. Targeted gene detection should be completed to enable early diagnosis and intervention to improve prognosis.

DE50-MD dogs are an animal model of DMD used as a final translational model for evaluation of promising treatments. MicroRNA (miR) expressions in the muscle of DE50-MD dogs represent potential biomarkers, but stable reference miRs must first be identified. The aim of this paper was to establish a panel of reference miRs for WT and DE50-MD dogs over a range of ages and muscle groups. RNA was extracted from WT and DE50-MD dog (N=6 per genotype) vastus lateralis muscle samples collected longitudinally at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months of age, and from muscles collected post-mortem (N=3 per genotype; cranial tibial, semimembranosus, lateral triceps and diaphragm). 87 RNAs were quantified in a subset of 6-month-old WT and DE50-MD muscles (N=4 per genotype) using the QIAcuity miFinder panel. GeNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder were used to identify a candidate panel of the 8 most stable small RNAs, which were then quantified in all RNA samples, alongside the commonly used reference RNA snRNA U6. The most stable miRs of this subset were used to normalise quantities of dystromiRs miR-1, miR-133a and miR-206, and fibromiR miR-214. MicroRNAs miR-191, let-7b, miR-125a and miR-15a were the most stable miRs tested, while snRNA U6 performed poorly. DystromiR expression, normalised to the geometric mean of the panel of reference miRs, was lower for miR-1 and miR-133a in DE50-MD compared to WT muscles, while miR-206 levels did not significantly differ between genotypes. FibromiR miR-214 was 2- to 4-fold higher in DE50-MD versus WT muscles. A normalisation factor derived from miR-191, let-7b, miR-125a and miR-15a is suitable for normalising miR expression data from WT and DE50-MD muscle over a range of ages and muscle types."

Here, we investigated the plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) proteome to identify disease-specific biomarkers that could accelerate therapy approvals. We extracted EVs from the plasma of DBMD and FSHD patients and healthy controls using size-exclusion chromatography, conducted mass spectrometry on the extracted EV proteins, and performed comparative analysis to identify disease-specific biomarkers. We correlated the levels of these biomarkers with clinical outcome measures and confounding factors. The muscle-associated proteins PYGM, MYOM3, FLNC, MYH2 and TTN were exclusively present in DBMD EVs. PYGM, MYOM3, and TTN negatively correlated with age. PYGM and MYOM3 levels were elevated in patients without cardiomyopathy, and PYGM levels were specifically elevated in ambulatory DMD patients. On the other hand, female FSHD patients displayed significantly higher MBL2 and lower GPLD1 levels. However, male FSHD patients exhibited higher C9 and lower C4BPB levels. Additionally, desmosome proteins JUP and DSP were uniquely found in FSHD males. MBL2 positively correlated with age and C4BPB negatively correlated with FSHD severity in male patients. Our findings underscore the sensitivity of analyzing circulating EV content to identify disease-specific protein biomarkers for DBMD and FSHD. Our results also emphasize the potential of EV-based biomarker discovery as a promising approach to monitor disease progression as well as effectiveness of therapies in muscular dystrophy, potentially contributing to their approval. Further research with larger cohorts is needed to validate these biomarkers and explore their clinical implications."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is complicated by bone fragility. This study aimed to elucidate changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition over time and to explore associations with adiposity measures in DMD. A three-year follow-up analysis was performed of total body (TB) and lumbar spine (LS) dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements, anthropometric measures, Tanner stage and bone turnover biomarkers assessments, and the incidence of fragility fractures in 26 ambulant prepubertal DMD patients treated with deflazacort (DFZ). Age at baseline was 7.7 years (interquartile range: 6-9.2). The TB BMD Z-score declined over time and was negatively related to the TB fat mass percentage and fat mass index (p < 0.05), but not to body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS). In contrast LS bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) Z-score remained stable and normal. The cumulative incidence of fragility fractures was 19.2%; DMD boys with fractures displayed a 1.5-fold higher decline of TB BMD Z-score/year (p < 0.05) and a worse adiposity profile compared to fracture-free patients. No difference was found in DFZ dose or duration between the two groups. We observed a high incidence of fragility fractures, and identified fat tissue as a potential detrimental factor for bone health, suggesting a need for monitoring in DMD patients with excessive adiposity. Fat mass measures assessed by DXA could help to identify those at risk, enabling targeted interventions for better bone health. The co-occurrence of multiple glucocorticoid side effects might characterize patients at higher risk of fractures."

The research involved twenty-three children with DMD and twelve healthy children. DMD cohort were randomized into two groups: treatment [Tele-MI training and telerehabilitation-based physiotherapy program (Tele-PTP), <i>n</i> = 12] and control (Tele-PTP, <i>n</i> = 11). MI ability [Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-10 (KVIQ-10), Motor Imagery Questionnaire for Children (MIQ-C), mental chronometry tests], motor function [Motor Function Measure (MFM), North Star Ambulation Assessment, Four Square Step Test] and timed performance were assessed at baseline and after 8-week training. MI ability scores of DMD cohort were lower than healthy children. A large interaction effect was found for KVIQ-10 visual and total, MIQ-C internal visual and kinesthetic scores, and delta time of 10-meter walk test of mental chronometry (η2 > 0.14). The small-medium interaction effect was found in motor function and ambulation results (η<sup>2</sup><0.14). This study demonstrated that Tele-MI training improved MI ability of DMD cohort. The small-to-medium effects of Tele-MI training on motor function, particularly those involving the trunk, have demonstrated its potential as a complementary approach in rehabilitation to improve motor functions in children with DMD.

    "title": "Dual pH-responsive CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein xenopeptide complexes for genome editing.",
    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated (Cas) protein has been proved as a powerful tool for the treatment of genetic diseases. The Cas9 protein, when combined with single-guide RNA (sgRNA), forms a Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) capable of targeting and editing the genome. However, the limited availability of effective carriers has restricted the broader application of CRISPR/Cas9 RNP. In this study, we evaluated dual pH-responsive amphiphilic xenopeptides (XPs) for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 RNP. These artificial lipo-XPs contain apolar cationizable lipoamino fatty acid (LAF) and polar cationizable oligoaminoethylene acid units such as succinoyl-tetraethylenepentamine (Stp) in various ratios and U-shaped topologies. The carriers were screened for functional Cas9/sgRNA RNP delivery in four different reporter cell lines, including a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) exon skipping reporter cell model. Significantly enhanced cellular uptake into HeLa cells, effective endosomal disruption in HeLa gal8-mRuby3 cells, and potent genome editing by several Cas9/sgRNA RNP complexes was observed in four different cell lines in the 5 nM sgRNA range. Comparing Cas9/sgRNA RNP complexes with Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA polyplexes in the DMD reporter cell model demonstrated similar splice site editing and high exon skipping of the two different molecular Cas9 modalities. Based on these studies, analogues of two potent U1 LAF<sub>2</sub>-Stp and LAF<sub>4</sub>-Stp<sub>2</sub> structures were deployed, tuning the amphiphilicity of the polar Stp group by replacement with the six oligoamino acids dmGtp, chGtp, dGtp, Htp, Stt, or GEIPA. The most potent LAF<sub>2</sub>-Stp analogues (containing dGtp, chGtp or GEIPA) demonstrated further enhanced gene editing efficiency with EC50 values of 1 nM in the DMD exon skipping reporter cell line. Notably, the EC50 of LAF<sub>2</sub>-dGtp reached 0.51 nM even upon serum incubation. Another carrier (LAF<sub>4</sub>-GEIPA<sub>2</sub>) complexing Cas9/sgRNA RNP and donor DNA, facilitated up to 43 % of homology-directed repair (HDR) in HeLa eGFPd2 cells visualized by the switch from green fluorescent protein (eGFP) to blue fluorescent protein (BFP). This study presents a delivery system tunable for Cas9 RNP complexes or Cas9 RNP/donor DNA polyplexes, offering an effective and easily applicable strategy for gene editing."

    "title": "Upper body gait deviations in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is primarily a disease of progressive muscle degeneration affecting the whole body. It is important to preserve the patients' walking ability as long as possible. Inconclusive information on Duchenne muscular dystrophy gait pattern is available for the lower body and missing for the upper body. This study aimed to objectively investigate upper body gait deviations in a group of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy compared to typically developing peers. Kinematic data of twelve boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that underwent three-dimensional full-body gait analysis were investigated retrospectively. Data were compared to sixteen healthy children of same age at similar walking speed. Statistical tests included the student independent t-test (with Holm-Bonferroni correction), Hedges'g for effect size, and statistical non-parametric mapping two-sample t-test (with Bonferroni correction). Duchenne muscular dystrophy compared to the healthy group: In the sagittal plane, the thorax segment was more posteriorly tilted. In addition, the relative angle between pelvis and thorax segment showed more backwards lean with increased shoulder extension. In the frontal plane, the patients walked with increased shoulder abduction and took wider strides. In the transverse plane, thorax rotation was not different between groups. Thorax range of motion was increased in all three planes. Including the upper body gait kinematics, especially of the trunk, adds valuable objective information on the understanding of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gait pattern. Our findings contribute to improved understanding of full-body gait compensations in this patient group."

The study found a strong correlation between pelvic obliquity and frontal spine deformity (p<0.01), as well as moderate relationships between pelvic obliquity, motor function, wheelchair usage duration, and knee flexion contractures (p<0.05). The study found that pelvic obliquity may lead to spinal health deterioration and motor function limitations in non-ambulatory patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, especially those with lower extremity joint contractures and long-term wheelchair use."

While cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is routinely used to assess fibrosis and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, CMR measures of LV filling and ejection in DMD have not been reported. Patients with DMD (n=179) and healthy controls (n=96) were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR. The DMD cohort was followed clinically at multiple institutions, and clinical data were recorded. Standard volumes and functions were calculated, and LV filling and ejection curves were measured from baseline CMR. Multivariable linear regressions were used to compare ventricular filling and ejection measures between groups, adjusting for baseline differences. Cox regressions were used to evaluate the relationship between diastolic function measures and mortality in the DMD cohort. Patients with DMD had significantly smaller stature and ventricular volumes than healthy control patients (<i>P</i><0.001). They had lower baseline LV ejection fraction (<i>P</i><0.001), though most had normal systolic function. When adjusted for age, sex, heart rate, body surface area, and LV end-diastolic volume, patients with DMD had slower peak filling rates (<i>P</i><0.001) and peak ejection rates (<i>P</i><0.001), as well as slower time to peak ventricular ejection rate (<i>P</i>=0.011). When adjusted for heart rate, a lower peak ventricular ejection rate (<i>P</i>=0.007) and peak filling rate (<i>P</i>=0.033), normalized to LV end-diastolic volume, were associated with mortality in patients with DMD. Patients with DMD have significantly different baseline CMR filling and ejection indices compared with controls. Some filling indices are associated with mortality and may be useful prognostic measures. Further research is needed in larger cohorts to determine the prognostic value of these differences."

    "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have therapeutic applications and potential for use in regenerative medicine. However, the use of hMSCs in research and clinical medicine is limited by a lack of information pertaining to their donor-specific functional attributes. In this study, we compared the characteristics of same-donor derived placenta (PL) and Wharton's jelly (WJ)-derived hMSCs, we also compared their mechanism of action in a skeletal muscle disease in vitro model. The same-donor-derived hWJ- and hPL-MSCs exhibited typical hMSC characteristics. However, GRO-α was differentially expressed in hWJ- and hPL-MSCs. hWJ-MSCs, which secreted a high amount of GRO-α, displayed a higher ability to inhibit necroptosis in skeletal muscle cells than hPL-MSCs. This demonstrates the anti-necroptotic therapeutic effect of GRO-α in the skeletal muscle cell death model. Furthermore, GRO-α also exhibited the anti-necroptotic effect in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse model. Considering their potential to inhibit necroptosis in skeletal muscle cells, hWJ-MSCs and the derived GRO-α are novel treatment options for skeletal muscle diseases such as DMD."

To detect skeletal muscle involvement in children with Becker muscular dystrophy using multiple-parameter quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI), and to determine the preferred muscle site and qMRI biomarker. Fat fraction, T1, and T2 measurements were conducted in Becker muscular dystrophy (n=29) and healthy controls (n=23). North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) was performed in Becker muscular dystrophy. Group differences were compared by using the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test or a linear mixed-effect model. Receiver operating characteristic analysis with area under curve (AUC) was used to compare the diagnostic performance. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictor of functional decline. Both fat fraction and T2 were effective in detecting muscle involvement across different functional stages that were categorized by NSAA, with fat fraction in gluteus maximus demonstrating the most superior diagnostic performance (AUC range, 0.85-0.98). The combination of T2 and T1 enables a good diagnosis of no abnormal fat-infiltrated muscles (AUC=0.82). Overall, fat fraction in gluteus maximus exhibited the strongest negative correlation with the NSAA score (r=-0.69, P<0.01) and emerged as an independent risk factor for functional decline (odds ratio=1.12, P=0.02). Multi-parametric qMRI demonstrate effective capabilities for early detection of muscle involvement, with gluteus maximus being the preferred muscle site. Fat fraction in gluteus maximus may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting functional decline."

A secondary aim was to explore how this concordance is related to parents' self-rated life satisfaction and status as a carrier mother versus non-carrier mother. In a cross-sectional study design, 70 boys with DMD, aged 5-14, and their parents were included. Results indicated no significant correlation between performance-based measures and parental or self-rated assessments of executive function (EF). However, parents with low life satisfaction and/or carrier status rated their child's EF skills significantly lower. But self-rated life satisfaction did not correlate with status as a carrier mother or the performance-based measures of the boys' and the boys' performance-based EF skills did not correlate with either their parents' life satisfaction or status as a carrier mother. These findings indicate that the two sources of information may not measure the same construct. One possible explanation for this is that our data supports the framework of hot and cold executive function (EF) skills and that these EF skills must be identified using different methods. Another possible explanation could be that parental ratings of child EF skills may also include measurement of carrier burden, parents EF skills, and the families' abilities for psychosocial adjustments in everyday life."

    "abstract": "Anesthesia management in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) is a complex challenge, requiring careful preoperative evaluation, tailored treatment strategies, and vigilant perioperative monitoring. This review examines the nuances of anesthesia in patients with NMD, addressing potential complications such as intubation difficulties, respiratory failure, and adverse effects of anesthetics and neuromuscular conduction blocking agents (NMBAs). Nondepolarizing NMBAs, including steroidal agents and benzylisoquinolines, are analyzed for their role, risks, and optimal use based on procedural requirements and patient characteristics. Challenges with depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine are highlighted, emphasizing the need for careful evaluation and monitoring to reduce the risk of adverse events such as malignant hyperthermia and hyperkalemia. The review highlights the role of reversal agents, particularly sugammadex, as a safer and more effective alternative to traditional acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine. Sugammadex reduces the risk of complications such as prolonged paralysis and respiratory failure in patients with NMD. In addition, anesthesia considerations tailored to specific NMDs, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and inflammatory myopathies are presented, including monitoring techniques and individualized approaches. Based on the available literature and the authors' clinical experience, this review aims to discuss the role of muscle relaxants in anesthesia in patients with the aforementioned neuromuscular disorders.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of providing care for a person with DBMD on caregivers' quality of life, perceived burden and financial well-being. 202 Polish caregivers of a person with DBMD were included and completed a self-administered, computer-assisted online survey. Results show that DBMD affects the quality of life of caregivers who score significantly lower than the national average in every domain: 85.1% of DBMD caregivers scored below the national average in the physical health domain; in the environmental domain 83.7%; in the social relationships domain 82.2%; and in the psychological domain 72.3%. It also demonstrates that DBMD is a source of severe burden (mean score of 35.3). Finally, we report that while some dimensions of respondents' quality of life and perceived burden were associated with patients' age and caregivers' educational status, financial well-being was the most important predictor of respondents' quality of life and caregiving burden. To improve DBMD caregivers' quality of life and alleviate their burden, future intervention programs should promote resiliency and active coping and develop a social support system and respite care. Additionally, it is crucial to provide caregivers with adequate financial resources to fulfil their needs."

His biography appeared in the American Journal of Medical Genetics in 1985. Later, an article by Frank Hill in the same journal was focusing on the role of Becker in the Third Reich.

This needs to be corrected. The \"Nazi Past\" of Becker was investigated very thoroughly in an article in the Journal of Child Neurology. Peter Emil Becker had no leading positions in Nazi organizations nor was he involved in Nazi crimes. He did not praise the leader state, like other researchers in his field did. A thorough inspection of his work shows that he was avoiding national socialistic topics such as racial biology and eugenics. But to further his academic career, however, he became a member of Nazi organizations."

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (AON) represent a promising treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) carrying out-of-frame deletions, but also show limitations. In a completed clinical trial golodirsen, approved by FDA to induce skipping of DMD gene exon 53 in eligible patients, we demonstrated increase in DMD expression and protein production, albeit with inter-patient variability. Here, we investigate further the golodirsen mechanism of action using myotubes derived from MyoD transfected fibroblasts isolated from DMD patients at the baseline of the clinical trial SRP-4053. We confirm golodirsen's selectivity and efficiency in removing only exon 53. For the first time in human cells, we revealed a significant reduction in the so called DMD \"transcript imbalance\", in golodirsen-treated DMD muscle cultures. The transcript imbalance is a unique DMD phenomenon characterized by non-homogeneous transcript expression along its entire length and responsible for the reduced stability of the transcript. Our in-vivo study also showed that the efficiency of exon skipping did not always correspond to a proportional restoration of the dystrophin protein. Predominant nuclear localization of the DMD transcript, observed in patients and animal models, persists even after exon skipping. All these findings suggest challenges other than AON delivery for high level of protein restoration in DMD, highlighting the importance of investigating the biological mechanisms upstream of protein production to further enhance the efficiency of any AON treatment in this condition."

We present the data supporting this qualification, providing insights into the evidentiary basis of qualification as a digital clinical outcome assessment. Clinical trials, natural history studies, and patient surveys (ages 5 - 14 years) showed that SV95C is accurate, valid, reliable, sensitive, and clinically meaningful. SV95C significantly correlated with traditional DMD assessments, increased rapidly after steroid initiation (0.090 m/s 3 months post-treatment), and declined steadily in patients on stable steroid regimens. Compared with traditional assessments, SV95C demonstrated earlier sensitivity to disease progression (3 vs 9 months) and greater sensitivity at 12 months. Distribution- and anchor-based approaches revealed a change of - 0.10 to - 0.20 m/s as clinically meaningful. The EMA qualification of SV95C illustrates the willingness of regulators to accept novel digital endpoints for drug approval, setting an important precedent for the evidentiary basis of regulatory digital endpoint qualification that could transform clinical development in disorders affecting movement."

A total of 352 healthy adult controls (ACs) from a national multicenter study, 100 schoolchild controls (SCs), and 281 patients with DMD/BMD from Peking Union Medical College Hospital were enrolled in this study. Cell-based inhibition assays were applied, and serum samples demonstrating 50% inhibition of infection were considered positive. The seroprevalence of AAV2 and AAV9 NAbs among the 733 participants was 86.1% and 56.3%, respectively. The AAV2 NAbs and AAV9 NAbs positivity rates in the AC, SC, and DMD/BMD groups were 97.4%/86.6%, 100.0%/17.0%, and 66.9%/32.4%, respectively. The seroprevalence of AAV NAbs gradually increased with age, especially in AAV9 NAbs. Females tended to have higher positivity rate than males. Over 85% of ACs had overlapping AAV9 and AAV2 infection. However, being positive for only AAV2 NAbs in the SC group was common, and 30.6% of patients with DMD/BMD were negative for both AAV2 and AAV9 NAbs. Our findings reveal that a significant proportion of patients with DMD/BMD were negative for AAV2 and AAV9 NAbs, which is the population that is most amenable to being treated with gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Premature termination codon (PTC) diseases, arising as a consequence of nonsense mutations in a patient's DNA, account for approximately 12% of all human disease mutations. Currently there are no FDA approved treatments for increasing PTC readthrough in nonsense mutation diseases, although one translational readthrough inducing drug, ataluren, has had conditional approval for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in Europe and elsewhere for 10 years. Ataluren displays consistent low toxicity in clinical trials for treatment of several different PTC diseases, but its therapeutic effects on such diseases are inconsistent. The identity of the stop codon and its sequence context are major determinants of PTC readthrough efficiency in both the absence and presence of nonsense suppressors. Previously we have shown that ataluren stimulates readthrough exclusively by competitively inhibiting release factor complex (RFC, eRF1.eRF3.GTP)-dependent catalysis of translation termination. Here, using an <i>in vitro</i> reconstituted system (PURE-LITE) and both ensemble and single molecule assays, we demonstrate that PTC identity and the immediately adjacent mRNA sequence contexts modulate the catalytic activity of RFC in terminating peptide elongation. Such modulation largely determines the effectiveness of ataluren in stimulating readthrough, whether added alone or in combination with either the aminoglycoside G418 or an anticodon edited aa-tRNA, each of which stimulate readthrough by mechanisms orthogonal to that of ataluren. Our results provide an attractive rationale for the variability of ataluren effectiveness in stimulating readthrough in clinical trials. Patients harboring a PTC mutation with a sequence context promoting strong interaction with RFC are predicted to be resistant to ataluren, whereas ataluren treatment should be more effective for patient sequences conferring weaker interaction with RFC."

    "abstract": "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), diaphragm muscle dysfunction results in respiratory insufficiency which is a leading cause of death in patients. Mutations to the dystrophin gene result in myocyte membrane instability, contributing to the structural deterioration of the diaphragm muscle tissues. With previous works suggesting the importance of lipin1 for maintaining skeletal muscle membrane integrity, we explored the roles of lipin1 in the dystrophic diaphragm. We found that the protein expression levels of lipin1 were reduced by 60% in the dystrophic diaphragm. While further knockdown of lipin1 in the dystrophic diaphragm leads to increased necroptosis, restoration of lipin1 in the dystrophic diaphragm results in reduced inflammation and fibrosis, decreased myofiber death, and improved respiratory function. Our results demonstrated that lipin1 restoration improved respiratory function by enhancing membrane integrity and suggested that lipin1 could be a potential therapeutic target for preventing respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure in DMD. Continued investigation is required to better understand the mechanisms behind these findings, and to determine the role of lipin1 in maintaining muscle membrane stability."

A quantitative clinical trial simulator (CTS) has been developed based on previously published five disease progression models describing each of the longitudinal changes in the velocity at which individuals can complete specified timed functional tests, frequently used as clinical trial efficacy endpoints (supine-stand, 4-stair climb, and 10 m walk/run test or 30-foot walk/run test), as well as each of the longitudinal changes in forced vital capacity and North Star Ambulatory Assessment total score. The model-based CTS allows researchers to optimize the selection of numerous trial parameters for designing trials for the five functional measures commonly used as endpoints in DMD clinical trials. This case report serves as a demonstration of the tool's functionality while providing an easy-to-follow guide for users to reference when preparing simulations of their own design. Two case studies, using input selection based on previous DMD clinical trials, provide realistic examples of how the tool can help optimize clinical trial design without the risk of decreasing statistical significance. This optimization allows researchers to mitigate the risk of designing trials that may be longer, larger, or more inclusive/exclusive than necessary."

Currently, four FDA-approved ASOs can target three different exons, but these therapies are mutation-specific and only benefit a subset of patients. Understanding the broad applicability of exon-skipping approaches is essential for prioritizing the development of additional therapies with the greatest potential impact on the DMD population. This review offers an updated analysis of all theoretical exon-skipping strategies and their applicability across the patient population, with a specific focus on DMD-associated mutations documented in the UMD-DMD database. Unlike previous studies, this approach leverages the inclusion of phenotypic data for each mutation, providing a more comprehensive and clinically relevant perspective. The theoretical applicability of all single and double exon-skipping strategies, along with multi exon-skipping strategies targeting exons 3-9 and 45-55, was evaluated for all DMD mutations reported in the UMD-DMD database. Single and double exon-skipping approaches were applicable for 92.8% of large deletions, 93.7% of small lesions, 72.4% of duplications, and 90.3% of all mutations analyzed. Exon 51 was the most relevant target and was applicable for 10.6% of all mutations and 17.2% of large deletions. Additionally, two multi-exon-skipping approaches, targeting exons 45-55 and 3-9, were relevant for 70.6% of large deletions and 19.2% of small lesions. Current FDA-approved ASOs were applicable to 27% of the UMD-DMD population analyzed, leaving a significant portion of patients without access to exon-skipping therapies. The clinical translation of alternative approaches is critical to expanding the accessibility of these therapies for the DMD population."

In skeletal muscle, the lack of dystrophin ultimately results in muscle wasting and the replacement of myocytes with fatty or fibrous tissues. In the heart, cardiomyocytes eventually fail and cause fatal cardiomyopathy. We present a case of a male patient and his younger brother with a maternally inherited inverted insertion of approximately 306 kb of chromosome 10 in the deep intronic region between exons 44 and 45 of the <i>DMD</i> gene, leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Chromosomal microarray, comprehensive muscular dystrophy genetic testing, and whole exome sequencing were negative. Targeted transcriptome RNA sequencing at an external lab showed no aberrant splicing. Research whole genome sequencing identified the copy number gain and insertion. Subsequent reanalysis of the RNA sequencing data showed possible aberrant splicing involving <i>DMD</i> exons 44-45, and research RNA sequencing revealed a fusion between the <i>DMD</i> gene on the minus strand of chromosome X and the <i>PFKFB3</i> gene on the plus strand of chromosome 10.

Microdystrophin expressing HIDEMs also improved expression of genes involved in STARS (striated muscle activator of Rho signaling) pathway albeit in selective DMD patients (with mild phenotype). Although in vivo observations did not bring progress in the mobility of <i>mdx</i> mice with HIDEMs, microdystrophin interventions this may argue against \"treadmill test\" as suitable for assessment of <i>mdx</i> mice recovery. Low-level signaling of the Rho pathway and inflammation-related factors in DMD myogenic cells can also contribute to the lack of success in a functional study. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of DMD pathogenesis and provides insights into potential novel therapeutic strategy, highlighting the importance of personalized gene therapy."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are a group of rare disorders characterized by significant genetic and clinical complexity. Advances in genomics have revolutionized both the diagnosis and treatment of NMDs. While fewer than 30 NMDs had known genetic causes before the 1990s, more than 600 have now been identified, largely due to the adoption of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). These technologies have enabled more precise and earlier diagnoses, although the genetic complexity of many NMDs continues to pose challenges. Gene therapy has been a transformative breakthrough in the treatment of NMDs. In spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), therapies like nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam have dramatically improved patient outcomes. Similarly, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has seen significant progress, most notably with the FDA approval of delandistrogene moxeparvovec, the first micro-dystrophin gene therapy. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the rarity of many NMDs, genetic heterogeneity, and the high costs associated with genomic technologies and therapies. Continued progress in gene therapy, RNA-based therapeutics, and personalized medicine holds promise for further breakthroughs in the management of these debilitating diseases."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, progressive, debilitating neuromuscular disease. The early childhood onset and debilitating nature of the disease necessitate decades of caretaking for most patients. Caregivers have a critical role in evaluating patients' physical functioning and/or response to treatment. Using DMD-specific caregiver-reported scales, the impact of delandistrogene moxeparvovec gene therapy on caregivers' perceived change in patient disease status or severity was evaluated using the Caregiver Global Impression of Change and Severity (CaGI-C and CaGI-S, respectively). In the Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (EMBARK; NCT05096221), the CaGI-C at week 52 and change from baseline to week 52 in CaGI-S were evaluated in a post hoc analysis. The CaGI-C assesses caregivers' impressions of change in DMD symptoms, physical ability, ability to perform daily activities, and overall health. The CaGI-S evaluates current severity of DMD symptoms, physical ability, ability to perform activities of daily living, and overall health. Data were evaluated using multi-domain responder index (MDRI) and ordinal regression analyses. MDRI analyses across all four CaGI-C items yielded a treatment difference of 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-2.5) favoring delandistrogene moxeparvovec; a treatment difference of 1.1 (95% CI 0.30-1.9) was observed for the CaGI-S favoring delandistrogene moxeparvovec. After adjusting for age, ordinal regression analysis showed a nominally significant increase in the odds of achieving a better rating for delandistrogene moxeparvovec-treated patients on all four CaGI-C items (≥ 3.8-fold increase). After adjusting for baseline severity and age, ordinal regression analysis showed a nominally significant increase in the odds of improvement on all four CaGI-S items (≥ 2.2-fold increase). These exploratory findings captured by caregiver-reported outcomes add to the totality of evidence that supports the clinical benefits of delandistrogene moxeparvovec for patients with DMD.

Here, we show the effects of GSK3 inhibition in male DBA/2J (D2) and C57BL/10 (C57) mdx mice. Treating D2 mdx mice with GSK3 inhibitors alone or in combination with aerobic exercise improves muscle strength, endurance, and morphology, attenuates the hypermetabolic phenotype, and enhances insulin sensitivity. GSK3 inhibition in C57 mdx mice also improves muscle fatigue resistance and increases cage ambulation. Moreover, muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown in mdx mice augments muscle force production and endurance. In both mdx strains, GSK3 inhibition increases bone mineral content and density. Overall, these improvements to muscle, metabolic, and bone health with GSK3 inhibition in mdx mice may have clinical implications for patients with DMD, where the current standard of care, glucocorticoids, delay the loss of ambulation but increase the risk for insulin resistance and osteoporosis. Along with our observation of lowered β-catenin content in DMD myoblasts, a known cellular target for GSK3, this study provides ample evidence in support of inhibiting GSK3 for this disease."

    "abstract": "Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration, leading to loss of ambulation, respiratory failure, and premature death. It affects approximately 1 in 3,500 live male births and is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which impairs muscle fiber stability. Current treatments are limited to managing symptoms and slowing disease progression, with no curative therapies available. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology has introduced a promising approach for directly correcting the genetic mutations responsible for DMD. This review explores the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 as a transformative therapy for DMD, highlighting its successes in preclinical models, the challenges associated with its delivery, and the obstacles to its clinical application. While preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 in restoring dystrophin expression and improving muscle function, significant hurdles remain, including optimizing delivery methods and ensuring long-term safety."

    "abstract": "In the fields of medicine and bioscience, gene editing is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic approach for treating pathogenic variants in humans and other living organisms. With advancements in technology and knowledge, it is now understood that most genetic defects are caused by single-base pair variants. The ability to substitute genes using genome editing tools enables scientists and doctors to cure genetic diseases and disorders. Starting with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas, the technology has evolved to become more efficient and safer, leading to the development of base and prime editors. Furthermore, various approaches are used to treat genetic disorders such as hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. As previously mentioned, most genetic defects leading to specific diseases are caused by single-base pair variants, which can occur at many locations in corresponding gene, potentially causing the same disease. This means that, even when using the same genome editing tool, results in terms of editing efficiency or treatment effectiveness may differ. Therefore, different approaches may need to be applied to different types of diseases. Prevalently, due to the safety of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors in gene therapy, most clinical trials of gene therapy are based on AAV delivery methods. However, despite their safety and nonintegration into the host genome, their limitations, such as confined capacity, dosage-dependent viral toxicity, and immunogenicity, necessitate the development of new approaches to enhance treatment effects. This review provides the structure and function of each CRISPR-based gene editing tool and focuses on introducing new approaches in gene therapy associated with improving treatment efficiency."

The study included 63 patients with genetically confirmed hereditary myopathy. Group 1 included 32 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who were in the early ambulatory stage. Group 2 included 15 patients at the late ambulatory stage. Group 3 included 16 patients with genetically confirmed forms of congenital myopathy. All patients performed a set of exercises, including dynamic aerobic exercises in the pool. The duration of the rehabilitation course was 4 months. At baseline and during follow-up after 2 and 4 months, we assessed: the distance of a 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) with fatigue assessment on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at the end of testing, time tests (running a distance of 10 m, climbing 4 steps) with determination of the functional class (FC) of test performance, spirometry indicators. Over 4 months of regular training, there were a positive dynamics in the results of a 6-MWT, a decrease in fatigue according to VAS, an improvement in running time of 10 meters' distance and the speed of climbing 4 steps, and an improvement in the FC of performing tasks (<i>p≤</i>0.01) in groups of patients with DMD at an early ambulatory stage and with congenital myopathies. An improvement in external respiratory function was found in all groups (<i>p≤</i>0.01). A significant correlations between body weight and BMI and a moderate correlation between the age of patients and indicators of motor abilities were revealed. There was a noticeable correlation between heart rate and the severity of fatigue when performing 6-MWT and running time of 10 meters' distance. When analyzing EchoCG data, the ejection fraction and shortening fraction were characterized by a noticeable correlations with the speed of climbing of 4 steps and a moderate correlations with the results of 6-MWT, fatigue during its implementation, running time of 10 meters' distance and its FC, as well as with the FC of climbing of 4 steps. Regular hydrokinesotherapy exercises can improve motor abilities, muscle endurance and speed in patients with DMD at the early ambulatory stage and in patients with congenital myopathies of childhood, as well as improve external respiratory function in patients with DMD and congenital myopathies in all ambulatory stages. In groups of patients with DMD, a significant relationship between indicators of speed, fatigue and endurance and the functional capabilities of the heart was revealed."

We used the optical genome mapping (OGM) technology to detect and analyze uncommon mutations or structural variations (SVs) within the DMD gene, thus contributing to more precise clinical diagnoses. We herein included eight patients with dystrophinopathy (six males and two females) in whom pathogenic variants of the DMD gene could not be accurately identified using MLPA and NGS. Clinical data were collected for all patients and genetic testing was performed using OGM. Conventional methods (MLPA and NGS) failed to detect pathogenic mutations in six out of eight individuals (four males and two females). OGM testing uncovered rare mutations in the DMD gene in four patients, including a pericentric inversion in chromosome X (one male), a complex rearrangement (one male), and two X-autosome translocations (two females). No mutations were detected in the remaining two male patients. OGM also accurately mapped balanced X-autosome translocations in female patients, defining chromosomal breakpoints. In the other two male patients in whom MLPA suggested non-contiguous exon duplications or deletions in the DMD gene, OGM characterized one case as a complex rearrangement and the other as a deletion within the DMD gene. OGM is a valuable diagnostic tool for dystrophinopathy patients with negative results from conventional genetic tests. It can effectively elucidate complex SVs and pinpoint breakpoints in X-autosomal translocations in female patients, facilitating prompt and appropriate interventions."

This prospective pilot study tested a novel screening questionnaire developed to identify the common behavioral (B), emotional (E), learning (L), and social (S) difficulties in BDMD. A total of 45 caregivers of BDMD patients (ages 4-19 years) seen at the Arkansas Children's Hospital Dystrophinopathy Clinic completed the BELS questionnaire during standard clinic visits. To establish external validity, caregivers also completed four well-validated standardized questionnaires assessing overlapping symptoms [Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17 (PSC-17), Colorado Learning Difficulties Questionnaire (CLDQ), the obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) subscale from the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS), and Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS)]. Caregivers reported high rates of behavioral (>60%), emotional (50%-70%), learning (50%-70%), and social (30%-50%) concerns, even though relatively few patients had clinical diagnoses related to these symptoms. Passive suicidality (i.e., thoughts of death) were also common (22.2%; 10/45 patients). The BELS questionnaire was moderately to highly correlated with total scores on the four well-validated questionnaires (p < .001), and BELS subscales showed specificity. A BELS score of 21 corresponded with the established PSC-17 cutoff. The BELS questionnaire shows promise as a screening questionnaire to identify neurobehavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms common in dystrophinopathy. While BELS cannot currently be used as a standalone measure to make clinical diagnoses, identification of symptoms that warrant further follow-up may improve clinical care and quality of life."

    "abstract": "Myogenesis is essential for skeletal muscle formation and regeneration after injury, yet its regulators are largely unknown. Here we identified fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (FNDC1) as a previously uncharacterized myokine. In vitro studies showed that knockdown of Fndc1 in myoblasts reduces myotube formation, while overexpression of Fndc1 promotes myogenic differentiation. We further generated recombinant truncated mouse FNDC1 (mFNDC1), which retains reliable activity in promoting myoblast differentiation in vitro. Gain- and loss-of-function studies collectively showed that FNDC1 promotes cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle regeneration in adult mice. Furthermore, recombinant FNDC1 treatment ameliorated pathological muscle phenotypes in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Mechanistically, FNDC1 bound to the integrin α5β1 and activated the downstream FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to promote myogenic differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of integrin α5β1 or of the downstream FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway abolished the pro-myogenic effect of FNDC1. Collectively, these results suggested that myokine FNDC1 might be used as a therapeutic agent to regulate myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration for the treatment of acute and chronic muscle disease."

At study endpoint, there were trends towards increased lean mass, reduced fat mass, reduced creatine kinase and improved motor function. The investigation was motivated by studies in mouse muscular dystrophy models in which once weekly glucocorticoid exposure enhanced muscle strength and reduced fibrosis. WSiMD participants provided blood samples for aptamer serum profiling at baseline and after 6 months of weekly steroids. A subset completed magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of muscle at study onset and endpoint. At baseline compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls, the aggregate serum protein profile in the WSiMD cohort was dominated by muscle proteins, reflecting leak of muscle proteins into serum. Disease status produced more proteins differentially present in serum compared to steroid-treatment effect. Nonetheless, a response to prednisone was discernable in the WSiMD cohort, even at this low dose. Glucocorticoids decreased muscle proteins and increased certain immune process- and matrix-associated proteins. Muscle MR fat fraction showed trends with functional status.

A comparison was made with a previously published cohort of 162 female carriers identified through population screening. Duplications classified as \"difficult to predict\" were absent in DMD/BMD patients, as opposed to 45.1% of women analyzed in the scope of population screening (p < 0.0001). While the distribution of deletions did not differ between the groups, significantly higher proportion of duplications initiated at the proximal hot spot in the DMD/BMD cohort (87.1%), vs. only 11.7% in women analyzed through population screening (p = 0.0038). Notably, duplications initiating in the dp427c promoter area were noted only in the latter cohort (n = 62). Local databases of dystrophinopathy patients can facilitate analysis and reporting of pregestational female population screening results.

Urinary titin, a degradation product of the giant protein titin present in muscle sarcomeres, has been used as a biomarker to reflect muscle degradation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a more severe dystrophinopathy. However, the clinical significance of urinary titin levels in BMD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between urinary titin levels and the clinical data in patients with BMD. Urine samples were collected from 123 patients with BMD, and urinary titin levels were measured. The association of urinary titin with clinical data, including age, physical measurements, physical activity, blood tests, and cardiopulmonary test results, was examined. A total of 257 urine samples were obtained from patients of 5-79 years of age. The median urinary titin level was 72.6 pmol/mg Cr (range 0.2-4325.0 pmol/mg Cr). No strong correlation was found between urinary titin levels and age, physical measurements, physical function, blood test results, or cardiopulmonary function. However, on comparing clinical data between the age-matched high urinary titin (N = 94) and normal (N = 29) groups, the high urinary titin group had a significantly greater number of non-ambulatory cases (23.9 % vs. 3.6 %), weaker grip strength (16.3 vs. 32.0 kg), and higher serum creatine kinase (1072 vs. 398 U/L) and cardiac troponin I (10.6 vs. 2.5 pg/mL) levels.

    "abstract": "Through their myogenic activity, adult muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are crucial for the regeneration of striated skeletal muscle. Once activated, they proliferate, differentiate and then fuse to repair or form new muscle fibers (myofibers). Their progression through myogenesis requires a complex regulation involving multiple players such as metabolism, in particular via AMPK. This protein kinase regulates the self-renewal and myonuclear accretion of MuSCs after acute skeletal muscle injury or skeletal muscle contraction. However, in a context of dystrophy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the regenerative capacity of MuSCs is reduced, presumably due to an increase of the proliferation that is detrimental to differentiation. We are interested here in the potential of metabolism to regulate the myogenic activity of MuSCs in DMD via AMPK."

Our results showed significant upregulation of PD-L1 in MuSCs under hypoxia and IFN-γ conditions without affecting cellular proliferation and differentiation <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, these preconditioned MuSCs led to decreased infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in implanted limb muscles of mouse models. Blocking PD-L1 reduced graft survival in muscles treated with MuSCs. Conversely, increased PD-L1 expression and reduced T cell infiltration correlated with improved graft survival, as identified by pre-labeled LacZ + MuSCs following transplantation. This study provides evidence that hypoxia and IFN-γ preconditioning of MuSCs can significantly enhance the efficacy of cell therapy for DMD by mitigating immune rejection.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene encodes dystrophin, a large multidomain protein. Its nonfunctionality leads to dystrophinopathies like DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy, for which no cure is yet available. A few therapies targeted towards specific mutations can extend the lifespan of patients, although with limited efficacy and high costs, emphasizing the need for more general treatments. Dystrophin's complex structure with poorly understood domains and the presence of multiple isoforms with varied expression patterns in different tissues pose challenges in therapeutic development. The C-terminal (CT) domain of dystrophin is less understood in terms of its structure-function, although it has been shown to perform important functional roles by interacting with another cytosolic protein, dystrobrevin. Dystrophin and dystrobrevin stabilize the sarcolemma membrane by forming a multiprotein complex called dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex that is destabilized in DMD. Dystrobrevin has two major isoforms, alpha and beta, with tissue-specific expression patterns. Here, we characterize the CT domain of dystrophin and its interactions with the two dystrobrevin isoforms. We show that the CT domain is nonglobular and shows reversible urea denaturation as well as thermal denaturation. It interacts with dystrobrevin isoforms differentially, with differences in binding affinity and the mode of interaction. We further show that the amino acid differences in the CT region of dystrobrevin isoforms contribute to these differences. These results have implications for the stability of dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex in different tissues and explain the differing symptoms associated with DMD patients affecting organs beyond the skeletal muscles."

However, reports describing the efficacy and safety of viltolarsen treatment in patients with DMD, particularly those comparing patients receiving viltolarsen with age- and time-period-matched controls, are limited. This study aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of viltolarsen treatment in patients with DMD. We retrospectively reviewed real-world data of patients with DMD aged 6-19 years who started viltolarsen treatment between July 2020 and February 2021 and compared them with age- and time-period-matched patients with DMD who did not receive viltolarsen. Five patients received viltolarsen treatment for over 3 years. Three of the four patients who received viltolarsen once weekly maintained motor function, while one ambulatory patient showed remarkably slow motor function decline. Conversely, eight of nine patients who did not receive viltolarsen and one patient who underwent intermittent viltolarsen treatment showed motor function deterioration. Two patients showed significant treatment-related adverse events, namely swelling of the dorsal surface of the right hand due to extravasation of viltolarsen in one patient and axillary lymph node enlargement due to frequent intravenous infusion in another patient. None of the patients discontinued viltolarsen. Viltolarsen was a safe and effective treatment for patients with DMD, and the findings highlighted the importance of once-weekly and uninterrupted viltolarsen treatment. The distinct safety and efficacy of viltolarsen require further investigation using a large number of cases and a long follow-up period."

    "abstract": "Targeted next generation sequence analyses in a cohort of 961 previously described patients with clinically suspected Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD) revealed that 145/961 (15%) had variants in genes associated with other muscular dystrophies (OMDs). NGS was carried out in DMD negative patients after deletion/duplication analysis followed by WES for No variant cases. The majority of patients with OMDs had autosomal recessive diseases that included Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMDs), Bethlem, Ullrich congenital Myopathies and Emery-Driefuss muscular dystrophy. 3.5% of patients were identified with other disorders like Charcot-Marie Tooth and Nemaline myopathy. A small percentage of patients, 0.6% remain undiagnosed. Of a total of 78 genetic variants identified, 44 were found to be novel. Interestingly, a third of patients with OMDs were found to have LGMD2E/R4, a severe form of LGMD that afflicts young children with clinical symptoms similar to DMD. Almost one third of the unrelated LGMD2E/R4 patients had the same point mutation (c.544A>C) in the SGCB gene, suggestive of a founder effect, described here for the first time in India. This study underscores the need for a complete genetic work up to precisely diagnose patients and to initiate appropriate counseling programs, disease management and prevention strategies."

    "abstract": "Heart diseases are a significant contributor to global morbidity and mortality, and despite their diverse and complex mechanisms, treatment options remain limited. Maltol, a natural compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, exhibits potential for addressing this need. This study evaluates the cardioprotective effects of maltol in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac stress models and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Maltol's cardiac cytotoxicity was assessed in rodent (H9c2) and human (AC16) cells and compared with that of dapagliflozin to illustrate its cardiac safety. In ISO-induced stress models, maltol significantly reduced hypertrophic markers and inflammation while enhancing autophagy and antioxidant pathways. In the mdx mice, a DMD model, maltol treatment improved cardiac contractility and reduced pathogenic remodeling. Enhanced phosphorylation of phospholamban and trends toward higher SERCA2a expression indicated enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, which is crucial in DMD cardiomyopathy. This study demonstrated that maltol has the potential to provide therapeutic benefits for DMD and other cardiac conditions characterized by hypertrophy and inflammation, as evidenced by its well-known antioxidant properties, low cytotoxicity, and capacity to enhance cardiac function and Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a X-linked neuromuscular disorder arising from mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to a progressive muscle wasting and disability. Currently there is no universal therapy, and there is thus a strong interest in preclinical studies for finding novel treatments. The most widely used and characterized mouse model for DMD is the C57BL/10ScSn-Dmdmdx/J (BL10-mdx), but this model exhibits mild pathology and does not replicate key features of human disease. The D2.B10-Dmdmdx/J (D2-mdx) mouse is a more recent model which seems to better mimics the complex human DMD phenotype. However, the D2-mdx mouse remains less extensively characterised than its BL10-mdx counterpart. Quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression is an important tool to monitor disease progression and evaluate therapeutic efficacy, but measurements must be normalised to stably expressed reference genes, which should ideally be determined and validated empirically. We examined gene expression in the gastrocnemius (GC), diaphragm (DIA) and heart in the D2-mdx mouse, the BL10-mdx mouse, and appropriate strain-matched wild-type controls (D2-wt and BL10-wt), from 4 to 52 weeks of age, using a large panel of candidate references (ACTB, AP3D1, CSNK2A2, GAPDH, HPRT1, PAK1IP1, RPL13A, SDHA, and in the heart, also HTATSF1 and HMBS). Data was analyzed using GeNorm, Bestkeeper, deltaCt and Normfinder algorithms to identify stable references under multiple possible scenarios. We show that CSNK2A2, AP3D1 and ACTB represent strong universal reference genes in both GC and DIA, regardless of age, muscle type, strain and genotype, while HTATSF1 and SDHA are optimal for the heart. GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPL13A were conversely revealed to be poor references, showing tissue-, age- or disease-specific changes in expression. Our results illustrate the importance of determining appropriate reference genes for specific comparative scenarios, but also reconfirm that universal panels can nevertheless be identified for normalising gene expression studies in even complex pathological states."

    "abstract": "We present the first documented case of PURA syndrome in Colombia. This rare neurological disease results from mutations in the PURA gene located on chromosome 5, leading to haploinsufficiency of the PUR-α protein. This protein is essential for early brain development and neuronal function. The patient, a seven-years-old boy, started showing dystonic hand movements at 14 days of age; at six, he had neurodevelopmental delay, generalized hypotonia, frequent episodes of apnea, and swallowing difficulties. Although other conditions were initially considered, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a whole exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic variant c.692T>C (p.Phe231Ser) in the exon 1 of the PURA gene, not previously reported in other patients. With this finding, we adopted a comprehensive management approach addressing the patient’s characteristics and alterations. Since the PURA syndrome is not on the list of orphan/rare diseases recognized by the Colombian Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social, we hope our report will contribute to its official recognition. The case shows the importance of considering rare diagnoses in patients with uncommon neurological symptoms, underlining the usefulness of genomic sequencing in diagnosis and the need for collaboration to optimize healthcare for patients with PURA syndrome and similar diseases."

High vector doses (>1E14 vg/kg) are needed to globally transduce skeletal muscles; however, such doses trigger immune-related adverse events. Mitigating these immune responses is crucial for widespread application of AAV-based therapies. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from five participants prior to, and after, dosing. One subject in the high-dose cohort experienced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Few changes in cell frequencies occurred after treatment; however, differential gene expression demonstrated induction of interferon response genes in most T cell types. T cell clonotype and clumping analysis showed the expansion or appearance of groups of related TCR sequences in the post-treatment samples. Three of these expanded clumps could be assigned to prior human herpesvirus infections, two of which were present in the participant that exhibited TMA. These data provide insight on the mechanistic basis of human immune-AAV interactions and lay a foundation for improved understanding of why TMA arises in some patients and not others."

Dysregulation of H3K27ac level has been linked to muscle-related diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, yet the mechanisms through which H3K27ac influences myogenic differentiation are not fully understood. Here, we utilized the SGC-CBP30 drug, a CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitor, to reduce H3K27ac level and investigated its effect on myogenic differentiation of porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells. The results demonstrated an increased H3K27ac level during normal muscle satellite cell differentiation. We found that the addition of SGC-CBP30 resulted in a reduced level of H3K27ac based on ATAC-seq and CUT&Tag data. Our analysis revealed that a cluster characterized by reduced levels of H3K27ac and increased levels of H3K27me3 was enriched with motifs corresponding to Bach2, MafK, and Fosl2 transcription factors. Furthermore, knockdown of Bach2, MafK, and Fosl2 produced a similar suppression effect on myogenic differentiation. Taken together, our study contributes to a better understanding of how H3K27ac influences myogenic differentiation."

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children with DMD and investigate the relationships between sleep and respiratory function using spirometry, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), and polysomnography (PSG) along with capnography. Can low SNIP be a guide for detecting respiratory muscle involvement early and determining the right time to perform early PSG and capnography in DMD? Prospective, observational, cross-sectional study. This study included DMD patients aged <18 years. Pulmonary function tests were conducted using spirometry and SNIP, and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure were measured. PSG and capnography were performed within two weeks after the pulmonary function tests, and their relationships with each other were investigated. The study included 44 children. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was present in 70.5 % of patients, while nocturnal hypoventilation was observed in 4.5 %. SNIP values were significantly lower in patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS than in those without OSAS. An SNIP value below 40 cm H2O was associated with a 92.8 % prevalence of OSAS. SNIP is a valuable, noninvasive marker for the early detection of respiratory muscle involvement and SDB in patients with DMD. This study highlights the need for early and regular respiratory monitoring in children with DMD to enhance care and quality of life."

Evidence regarding PMO treatment patterns in real-world settings is limited. This study used longitudinal administrative claims data to characterize PMO treatment patterns among US patients with DMD. MarketScan<sup>®</sup> commercial and Medicaid data (January 1, 2018-December 31, 2021) were used to identify claims for PMO treatments (eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, casimersen). The proportion of days covered (PDC), proportion with continuous PMO claims coverage (no gaps in claims ≥ 30 days), and time to subsequent PMO claims after a ≥ 30-day gap in PMO claims were described. One hundred thirty-three patients with ≥ 1 PMO claim were identified. Multiple codes were needed to identify PMO treatment coverage. Mean age was 14.1 years; all patients were male. Mean continuous follow-up duration was 669.3 days. Median PDC was 83.4%. Seventy-four (55.6%) patients had continuous PMO claims coverage (no ≥ 30-day gaps in claims). Of the 59 patients with ≥ 1 gap in PMO claims of ≥ 30 days, 39 had ≥ 1 subsequent PMO claim. Accounting for censoring via Kaplan-Meier analysis, 75.5% had a subsequent PMO claim within 1 year after a ≥ 30-day gap, with a median time of 64 days (including the qualifying 30 days). Understanding treatment patterns is important for characterizing real-world utilization of precision genetic medicines. This study observed a high PDC for PMO treatments for DMD. Most patients had continuous PMO claims coverage, and most patients with a gap in PMO claims had a subsequent PMO claim. Nonetheless, the observed persistence may have been underestimated given shortcomings of claims data and payer coverage considerations. Caution should be exercised when inferring treatment effectiveness or tolerability based on observed treatment patterns from claims data alone for weight-based, infused PMO treatments."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the absence of the full form of the dystrophin protein, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells, including those in the heart and respiratory system. Despite progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with DMD, myocardial insufficiency persists as the primary cause of mortality, and existing therapeutic strategies remain limited. This study investigates the hypothesis that a dysregulation of the biological communication between infiltrating macrophages (MPs) and neurocardiac junctions exists in dystrophic cardiac tissue. In a mouse model of DMD (mdx), this phenomenon is influenced by the over-release of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4), a key inhibitor of nerve sprouting and a modulator of the neural function, by MPs infiltrating the cardiac tissue and associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, a hallmark of DMD. Givinostat, the histone deacetylase inhibitor under current development as a clinical treatment for DMD, is effective at both restoring a physiological microenvironment at the neuro-cardiac junction and cardiac function in mdx mice in addition to a reduction in cardiac fibrosis, MP-mediated inflammation, and tissue CSPG4 content. This study provides novel insight into the pathophysiology of DMD in the heart, identifying potential new biological targets. © 2024 The Author(s).

The CAT12 toolbox in SPM was used for MRI segmentations, assessing subcortical structures, cortical thickness, gyrification, and sulci depths for DMD patients (n = 40; 9-18 years) and age-matched controls (n = 40). Comparisons were made between DMD vs. controls, daily vs. intermittent corticosteroid treatment (n = 20 each), and Dp140<sup>+</sup> vs. Dp140<sup>-</sup> gene mutations (n = 15 vs. 25). MANCOVA, CAT12 3D statistics and Pearson correlations were conducted. DMD patients showed differences in volumes of distinct subcortical structures, left hemisphere cortical thickness, and gyrification in multiple brain areas compared with healthy controls. The daily treated DMD group exhibited differences in subcortical volumes and different patterns of cortical thickness, sulci depth, and gyrification compared to the intermittent treated DMD group. DMD Dp140<sup>+</sup> patients displayed altered gyrification and sulci depth compared to DMD Dp140<sup>-</sup> patients. Finally, we found correlations between neurobehavioral outcomes and brain areas that showed differences in cortical morphology associated with corticosteroid treatment. Both genotype and corticosteroid treatment are associated with variations in subcortical volumes and cortical morphology, albeit in different ways. Corticosteroid treatment appears to have a more profound association with differences in gray matter characteristics of brain regions that are associated with functional outcomes."

Ang 1 paracrine signalling maintains the endothelial barrier of blood vessels, preventing plasma leakage. Chronic inflammation, a consequence of DMD, causes endothelial barrier dysfunction in skeletal muscle. We aim to elucidate changes in the DMD mouse's gastrocnemius microvascular niche following local administration of Ang 1. Gastrocnemii were collected from eight-week-old mdx/utrn+/- and healthy mice. Additional DMD cohort received an intramuscular injection of Ang 1 to gastrocnemius and contralateral control. Gastrocnemii were collected for analysis after two weeks. Using immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative reverse transcription, we demonstrated an abundance of endothelial cells in DMD mouse's gastrocnemius, but morphology and gene expression were altered. Myofiber perimeters were shorter in DMD mice. Following Ang 1 treatment, fewer endothelial cells were present, and microvessels were more circular. <i>Vegfr1</i>, <i>Vegfr2</i>, and <i>Vegfa</i> expression in Ang 1-treated gastronemii increased, while myofiber size distribution was consistent with vehicle-only gastrocnemii. These results suggest robust angiogenesis in DMD mice, but essential genes were underexpressed-furthermore, exogenous Ang 1 attenuated angiogenesis. Consequentially, gene expression increased. The impact must be investigated further, as Ang 1 therapy may be pivotal in restoring the skeletal muscle microvascular niche."

Here we report a series of in vivo and in vitro studies characterizing the drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties of these three PMOs. Following a single intravenous dose, plasma exposure was consistent for all three PMOs in mouse, rat, and nonhuman primate (NHP), and plasma half-lives were similar for eteplirsen (2.0-4.1 h) and golodirsen (2.1-8.7 h) across species and more variable for casimersen (3.2-18.1 h). Plasma protein binding was low (<40%) for all three PMOs in mouse, rat, NHP, and human and was largely concentration independent. In the <i>mdx</i> mouse model of DMD, following a single intravenous injection, extensive biodistribution was observed in the target skeletal muscle tissues and the kidney for all three PMOs; consistent with the latter finding, the predominant route of elimination was renal. In vitro studies using liver microsomes showed no evidence of hepatic metabolism, and none of the PMOs were identified as inhibitors or inducers of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes or membrane drug transporters tested at clinically relevant concentrations. These findings suggest that key DMPK features are consistent for eteplirsen, golodirsen, and casimersen and provide evidence for the concept of a PMO drug class with potential application to novel exon-skipping drug candidates. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The PMOs eteplirsen, golodirsen, and casimersen share similar absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and DMPK properties, which provides evidence for the concept of a PMO treatment class. A PMO drug class may support a platform approach to enhance understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of these molecules. The grouping of novel agent series into platforms could be beneficial in the development of drug candidates for populations in which traditional clinical trials are not feasible."

These variants were identified using targeted long-read sequencing on patients' DNA. RNA sequencing/reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from muscle biopsies revealed the presence of a pseudoexon or retention of part of the intron in the transcript, resulting in the introduction of premature termination codons. This study enhances our understanding of pseudoexon activation mechanisms in DMD and underscores the diverse genetic abnormalities contributing to the disease's complexity."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are X-linked recessive disorders that affect the production of the protein dystrophin. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is typically an X-linked-recessive disorder involving the gene that codes for emerin. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) are both autosomal dominant disorders. Although commonly mistaken as a condition in which patients are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia with volatile inhalational anesthetics, muscular dystrophy is more closely associated with rhabdomyolysis. Providers developing an anesthetic plan for dental patients with muscular dystrophy must take into consideration the patient's baseline cardiac and pulmonary function as well as the potential for abnormalities. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker use is safe but likely to result in prolonged skeletal muscle relaxation. Succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics are generally contraindicated due to the risks of rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia with subsequent ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death if left untreated. In-depth understanding of the more commonly encountered forms of muscular dystrophy is vital to providing safe and effective ambulatory anesthesia care for patients undergoing dental treatment outside the traditional hospital operating room setting."

Understanding the natural history of BMD is crucial for optimizing patient care and developing targeted treatments. Retrospective data were collected from 943 patients diagnosed with BMD based on a combination of clinical, biochemical and genetic criteria followed by 17 Italian neuromuscular centres. Patients' demographics, main signs and symptoms at BMD onset, neuropsychiatric comorbidities, age at loss of ambulation, cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary forced vital capacity and DMD mutations were collected. Disease milestones were analysed in specific DMD mutational groups. The median age at the last assessment was 26.0 (16.6-41.9) years, with a median age at diagnosis of 7.5 (4.0-14.0) years. In 55% of patients, the diagnosis was prompted by the incidental finding of hyperCKaemia. At the last assessment, 13.5% of patients had lost the ability to walk at a median age estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis of 69 years. Thirty per cent of patients exhibited left ventricular impairment and 2.7% respiratory involvement. Ten per cent of patients carried out-of-frame mutations, 4% nonsense mutations and 86% in-frame deletions/duplications. The subset of in-frame deletions was classified further based on the specific mutations. Patients carrying del45-49 compared with del45-47 were associated with an earlier loss of ambulation (P = 1 × 10-4), whereas patients with del45-55 (P = 0.005), del48 (P = 0.02) and del48-49 (P = 0.02) were correlated with a later loss of ambulation compared with del45-47. Both del45-55 (P = 0.002) and del48 (P = 0.003) were significantly associated with decreased odds of developing a pathological left ventricular ejection fraction compared with del45-47. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of BMD and capture precious data in the era of emerging therapies. The knowledge of the specific DMD mutation might help to define a prognosis in a subset of BMD patients and will serve as a model for the design of future therapies."

Subsequent fetal chromosomal karyotyping was conducted, and genomic DNA from fetal cells was extracted for copy number variation sequencing (CNV-Seq) analysis, complemented by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect deletions or duplications within the DMD gene.NIPT results for the two samples indicated potential abnormalities involving chromosomes 21 and 18. However, karyotype analysis of the fetuses revealed no abnormalities. CNV-Seq identified deletions of 0.28 and 0.18 Mb within chromosome Xp21.1, encompassing the DMD gene, in each fetus. In family 1, MLPA results indicated a maternal heterozygous deletion spanning exons 12 to 41 in the DMD gene, while the fetus exhibited deletions in exons 12 to 41. In family 2, MLPA results confirmed normal DMD gene status in the pregnant woman's peripheral blood genomic DNA but revealed a fetal deletion spanning exons 48 to 52. Both fetuses were diagnosed with DMD and subsequently underwent termination.Abnormalities identified through NIPT necessitate further invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. For cases involving chromosomal microdeletions or microduplications, a combination of karyotyping and CNV-Seq testing is essential for comprehensive diagnosis. NIPT followed by CNV-Seq may offer insights into large exon deletions within the DMD gene in specific instances. · NIPT results can offer valuable insights into the deletion and duplication of DMD gene for the fetus.. · It's crucial to notice unexpected findings in NIPT.. · A combination of karyotyping and CNV-Seq testing is essential for comprehensive diagnosis.."

[Results] Significant increases in the maximum right thigh circumference and prolonged 10-m running time were observed in 2020. Interestingly, an unexpected improvement in ankle dorsiflexion angle was noted in both ankles. No other statistically significant differences were observed among the assessed time points. [Conclusion] These findings highlight the critical importance of continuous exercise and rehabilitation for ambulatory children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, emphasizing the potential of rehabilitation to mitigate and restore the transient motor function deterioration observed during periods of behavioral restrictions."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked chromosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle function and mass. Male individuals affected by this condition often live into their late teens or early twenties and are confined to wheelchairs. Since there is currently no treatment for DMD, complementary and alternative medicines have become more widely used to help patients manage their condition and enhance their quality of life. Electroacupuncture has demonstrated beneficial results in terms of skeletal muscle protection. Here we have reported a case of DMD aged 8 years, who had proximal weakness in the lower limb which is progressive over a period associated with waddling gait and indicated with Gower's sign which had affected the quality of life. The patient was treated with electroacupuncture for 15 sessions, over 21 days. The report documented an improvement in the patient's motor (Timed Function Test), functional abilities (North Star Ambulatory Assessment and 6-Minute Walk Test), and quality of life (PedsQL 4.0), which had not been noticed previously. We documented the significance of electroacupuncture in treating DMD and improving functional ability and quality of life, which can be used as a complementary medicine to manage DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder. Female carriers can manifest symptoms during pregnancy, complicating diagnosis and genetic counseling before conception. This is the first report of a DMD symptomatic carrier who was managed continuously from preconception through pregnancy for symptoms recognized before conception. A 31-year-old primipara woman was incidentally noted to have premature ventricular contractions, heart failure, and elevated creatine kinase levels 2 years before pregnancy. Genetic testing confirmed that the patient was a symptomatic carrier of DMD. She had no family history of muscular or cardiac disease, suggesting a de novo variant. She received genetic counseling and planned amniocentesis during pregnancy as prenatal diagnosis. After treatment with bisoprolol and flecainide, her cardiac function improved, and natural conception was achieved. Amniocentesis performed at 16 weeks of gestation indicated a 46, XX karyotype, leading to the decision to continue the pregnancy. From week 16 to 21, the fetus exhibited bradycardia due to blocked premature atrial contraction, which later improved, although the atrioventricular interval was prolonged. The mother delivered vaginally without any complications, and the infant's atrioventricular interval normalized. Preconceptional diagnosis and treatment for DMD carrier status are crucial for shared decision-making and to achieve favorable perinatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal disease caused by mutations in the <i>DMD</i> gene that encodes dystrophin. Dystrophin deficiency also impacts muscle stem cells (MuSCs), resulting in impaired asymmetric stem cell division and myogenic commitment. Using MuSCs from DMD patients and the DMD mouse model <i>mdx</i>, we found that PTPN1 phosphatase expression is up-regulated and STAT3 phosphorylation is concomitantly down-regulated in DMD MuSCs. To restore STAT3-mediated myogenic signaling, we examined the effect of K884, a novel PTPN1/2 inhibitor, on DMD MuSCs. Treatment with K884 enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation and promoted myogenic differentiation of DMD patient-derived MuSCs. In MuSCs from <i>mdx</i> mice, K884 treatment increased the number of asymmetric cell divisions, correlating with enhanced myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, the pro-myogenic effect of K884 is specific to human and murine DMD MuSCs and is absent from control MuSCs. Moreover, PTPN1/2 loss-of-function experiments indicate that the pro-myogenic impact of K884 is mediated mainly through PTPN1. We propose that PTPN1/2 inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to restore the myogenic function of MuSCs in DMD."

    "abstract": "Project HERCULES has developed a natural history model (NHM) of disease progression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that comprises eight ordered health states (two ambulatory states, one transfer state indicating increased caregiver burden in which patients cannot walk/run 10m or rise from floor but can still support their own weight, and five non-ambulatory states). The current study used data from nine sources (clinical trial placebo arms, one real-world dataset, and three natural history datasets) to further characterize patients with DMD according to these health states. The study included 1,173 patients across 5,306‬ visits. Patients were on average older and exhibited worse ambulatory, pulmonary, upper limb, and cardiac functions with each successive health state. Mean±SE ages increased monotonically across health states, starting with 8.47±0.07 for early ambulatory, 10.86±0.13 for late ambulatory, 11.65±0.35 for transfer state, and ranging from 13.17±0.32 to 16.84±0.37 for the non-ambulatory states. North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score, which measures motor function and ranges from 34 (best) to 0 (worst), was 23.7 (interquartile range [IQR]: 20-30) for early ambulatory patients, 12.7 (IQR: 9-16) for late ambulatory patients, and 3.9 (IQR: 2-5) for transfer patients. Pulmonary function as measured by mean±SE of forced vital capacity percent predicted (FVC%p) was 94.5±0.8 for early ambulatory, 89.1±1.4 for late ambulatory, and 80.2±2.8 for transfer states, and decreased from 77.2±1.7 to 20.6±1.6 across the five non-ambulatory health states. In summary, these findings further characterize health states and their interpretation in economic modeling and decision-making in DMD management."

Therapeutic strategies feature glucocorticoid corticosteroids plus gene therapy/stop codon read-through, plus standards of care. Prolonged survival, delayed loss of ambulation (LoA), and innovative treatment prescriptions pose new clinical challenges, including identification of new outcome measures/targets and implementation of continuity of care. We report on the results of an Italian experts' meeting held in Rome, Italy on 20<sup>th</sup> April 2022. We aimed to: discuss challenges linked to transitioning from the ambulatory to the non-ambulatory phase, and from pediatric to adult care; collect experience on the importance of ongoing care and treatment in advanced disease stages and on the need to measure clinically relevant outcomes during disease progression after LoA. Following LoA the main management focus shifts to cardiac, respiratory, orthopaedics, nutrition and upper limbs function. More data on clinical needs, available treatments, standards of care, frequency of follow-up, and transition should be collected in order to facilitate management optimisation. Shared protocols should be developed, especially to improve patients' management in the acute setting. Transition from paediatric to adult services and from the ambulatory to the non-ambulatory phase require a multidisciplinary approach and the Identification of clinically meaningful outcome measures, which should be described in long-term longitudinal studies."

There is no curative therapy for this pathology, that is currently managed with a combination of physiotherapy and pharmacological interventions limiting the progression of the disease (e.g. corticosteroids, cardiac medications). However, a new opportunity is represented by gene therapy, a promising treatment that, however, requires significant expertise during the whole delivery of care and a solid organisational infrastructure. An organisational strategy that could effectively support its delivery to DMD patients in Italy is the hub-and-spoke model. However, an accurate portrait of the present network of DMD centres of expertise in Italy and of their readiness in the delivery of gene therapy is paramount, to facilitate access to this experimental medicine in the future. In this context, the present study aimed to map the DMD centres of expertise in Italy and later evaluate their preparedness in terms of gene therapy delivery. For this purpose, a series of items was proposed to 30 centres in Italy, of which 20 responded. After assessing the readiness of the involved centres in terms of patient preparation, therapy infusion, close surveillance, and long-term follow-up, we proposed a suitable organizational model, namely a flexible hub-and-spoke model, for the delivery of gene therapy in the Italian DMD network and solutions to tackle the challenges emerged from the survey. Overall, the present study detected an adequate readiness of the Italian DMD centres of expertise, despite observing a significant room for improvement in digital infrastructures, culture, and training."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical utility of expanded carrier screening (ECS) in Chinese preconception and prenatal populations, focusing on carrier frequency and the impact on at-risk couples (ARCs). Data from 6,298 Chinese individuals from 4,420 families who underwent a 149-gene ECS panel at a single center were analyzed. The prevalence of positive carriers and ARCs was determined, with follow-up on reproductive decisions and pregnancy outcomes for ARCs. Of the individuals screened, 2,673 (42.4 %) were carriers of at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, and 98 (2.22 %) ARCs were identified. GJB2-related deafness and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were the most common autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked disorders. Screening the top 11 (gene carrier rate [GCR] ≥ 1/100), 22 (GCR ≥ 1/200), and 41 (GCR ≥ 1/331) AR genes could identify 53.5 %, 67.9 %, and 81.3 % of variants, respectively. The corresponding ratios for identified ARCs were 90.4 %, 94.0 %, and 100 %. Follow-up data from 80 ARCs indicated that 75.0 % (60/80) took significant action based on the ECS results. Additionally, four families (3.5 %, 4/115) were identified at risk for a second disease unrelated to their initial family monogenic history. This study, representing the largest cohort of a moderate-sized ECS panel test in the Chinese population, demonstrates the clinical utility of ECS in both healthy individuals and those with a family history of monogenic disorders. The data obtained provide valuable insights for developing a Chinese-specific ECS panel. Tailored approaches are critical for wider adoption and successful routine application of ECS."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are genetically heterogeneous diseases characterized by primary skeletal muscle atrophy. The collapse of muscle structure and irreversible degeneration of tissues promote the occurrence of comorbidities, including cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and adipogenic cellular infiltrates that exacerbate the symptomatology of MD patients. Gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic anomalies are common in MD patients and may be determined by the interaction between the intestine and its microbiota. Therefore, the gut-muscle axis is one of the actors involved in the spread of inflammatory signals to all muscles. In this review, we aim to examine in depth how intestinal dysbiosis can modulate the metabolic state, the immune response, and mitochondrial biogenesis in the course and progression of the most investigated MDs such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Myotonic Dystrophy (MD1), to better identify gut microbiota metabolites working as therapeutic adjuvants to improve symptoms of MD."

The current study aimed to optimize the development of DEC therapy via the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated fusion protocol of human myoblasts derived from normal, unrelated donors. The optimization of cell fusion assessed different factors influencing fusion efficacy, including myoblast passage number, the efficacy of PKH myoblast staining, the ratio of the single-stained myoblasts in the MIX, and PEG administration time. Additionally, the effect of PEG fusion procedure on cell viability was assessed. A correlation was found between the number of cells used for PKH staining and staining efficacy. Furthermore, the ratio of single-stained myoblasts in the MIX and PEG administration time correlated with fusion efficacy. There was no correlation found between the myoblast passage number and fusion efficacy. This study successfully optimized the myoblast fusion protocol for creation of human DEC cells, introducing DEC as a new Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) for DMD patients."

Emergent disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in nonsense Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD) has brought new perspectives to slow down functional decline in this fatal disease. To investigate if there are differences in natural history between nmDMD and other genotypes, we described a retrospective cohort analysis of 25 nonsense mutation DMD (nmDMD) boys without disease-modifying therapy, aged between 1 and 22 years, over the last 15 years (2007-2022) in a single neuromuscular center in Rio de Janeiro and use published data on DMD natural history for comparison. Regarding prognostic factors, there were remarkable and statistically significant early loss of ambulation (at 9.1y ±2.1) and shortening of life expectancy (17.6y ±2.1) in our nmDMD group. Late acquisition of neurodevelopmental milestones and annual rates of decline in respiratory, cardiac, and timed motor function tests are the same between nmDMD patients with standard care and other DMD genotypes as described in the literature. Our data indicates the similarity of natural history and disease progression among DMD boys with nmDMD mutations compared to different mutations."

The study used an experimental model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, at 3 stages of degeneration/regeneration of muscle fibers: an acute stage (14-28 days old), acute and stabilized stages (14-42 days old), and a stabilized stage (28-42 days old). Photobiomodulation therapy (also known as low-level light therapy) at 0.6 J was applied 3 times per week to the dystrophic gastrocnemius muscle of mdx mice at ages 14 to 28, 14 to 42, and 28 to 42 days. After the treatment period, the gastrocnemius muscle was collected, and cryosections were prepared for histopathologic analysis. In all 3 stages evaluated, a significant reduction was observed in immunoglobulin G uptake by muscle fibers, the inflammatory area, macrophage infiltration, the reactive dihydroethidium area, and the number of autofluorescent lipofuscin granules in the gastrocnemius muscle of mdx mice after PBMT. The results demonstrated that low-level light therapy, when applied during or after the acute phase of the degeneration/regeneration muscle process, improves the pathological histomorphologic features in dystrophic muscle. Based on these results, PBMT appears to be a promising therapy for dystrophinopathies, warranting further research in humans to verify its efficacy."

CRISPR technology emphasises on gene editing, gene regulation modulation, and formulation of defined genetic changes. Its applications in treatment of the genetic disorders are extended beyond traditional therapies. These techniques are being explored as treatment of several genetic disorders including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington disease. Despite considerable therapeutic potential of gene therapy, several obstacles must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in clinical practice, particularly in terms of ensuring safety and effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe degenerative muscle disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin. Despite its initial description in the late 19th century by French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne, and identification of causal DMD genetic mutations in the 1980s, therapeutics remain challenging. The current standard of care is corticosteroid treatment, which delays the progression of muscle dysfunction but is associated with significant adverse effects. Emerging therapeutic approaches, including AAV-mediated gene transfer, CRISPR gene editing, and small molecule interventions, are under development but face considerable obstacles. Although DMD is viewed as a progressive muscle disease, muscle damage and abnormal molecular signatures are already evident during fetal myogenesis. This early onset of pathology suggests that the limited success of current therapies may partly be due to their administration after aberrant embryonic myogenesis has occurred in the absence of dystrophin. Consequently, identifying optimal therapeutic strategies and intervention windows for DMD may depend on a better understanding of the earliest DMD disease mechanisms. As newer techniques are applied, the field is gaining increasingly detailed insights into the early muscle developmental abnormalities in DMD. A comprehensive understanding of the initial events in DMD pathogenesis and progression will facilitate the generation and testing of effective therapeutic interventions."

After translation process, internal consistency, interrater and test-retest reliability of the NSAA were determined by using the Cronbach Alpha Coefficient and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), respectively. Absolute reliability was determined by using the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) with minimal detectable change at 95% limits of confidence (MDC<sub>95</sub>). Lower limb functionality of children was evaluated by Vignos Lower Extremity Scale (VLERS). To establish convergent validity, the correlations between T-NSAA and Motor Function Measure (MFM-32), 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), and VLERS were analyzed by using the Spearman's correlation coefficient.

Taking \"deflazacort\" \"Steven-Johnson syndrome\" \"toxic epidermal necrolysis\" in Chinese or English as the keywords, literature was searched at CNKI, Wanfang, China Biomedical Literature Database and PubMed up to July 2024. The clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of deflazacort-induced SJS-TEN were summarized. <b>Results:</b> A 12-year-old boy was admitted with a 3-day history of rash. He was diagnosed with DMD at the age of 3 and had been treated with prednisolone since the age of 8. Forty-four days before admission, the patient started deflazacort to replace prednisolone. Three days before admission, progressively worsening erythematous maculopapular rashes, blisters and skin peeling (8% body surface area), oral mucosal erosion, and exudative conjunctivitis occurred, thus deflazacort was discontinued. Complete remission of SJS was achieved after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, total 1.4 g/kg), 2 doses of etanercept (0.9 mg/kg, once), subcutaneous injection and intravenous methylprednisolone (0.7 mg/(kg·d)). Based on the literature, there were 5 reports in English while none in Chinese, altogether 7 cases were reported. All the patients were male, aged 3-45 years. Duration of deflazacort exposure was 2-8 weeks. Dermatology diagnosis of our case was SJS, and 5 cases were TEN. One patient was diagnosed with exudative erythema multiforme, and subsequent deflazacort oral challenge test was positive. Treatment included methylprednisolone or dexamethasone in 5 cases, IVIG in 6 cases, etanercept in 3 cases and cyclosporine in 1 case. All patients recovered completely. <b>Conclusion:</b> The synthetic corticosteroid deflazacort can cause rare but severe adverse reactions such as SJS-TEN, which needs close monitoring and prompt recognition and management."

Currently, there is limited evidence as to the optimal models of care during this stage of the condition.. To address this, in 2023, Treat-NMD facilitated the Early Diagnosis for DMD project; bringing together 42 experts from across Europe, the US and Australasia, including health care professionals, researchers, and people with lived experience to discuss the complexities of an early or newborn diagnosis of DMD, and provide recommendations regarding approaches to multidisciplinary care. A series of virtual meetings followed by a hybrid workshop resulted in broad recommendations to support clinicians in caring for children and families following an early diagnosis of DMD. The workshop did not define a cut-off for early diagnosis, however much of the discussion focused on diagnoses that occurred prior to 2 years. There is recognition that boys may first present with non-motor symptoms, such as speech delay or neurodevelopmental issues that are secondary to their dystrophinopathy, and therefore this report refers reflects that infants with DMD may be presymptomatic or early symptomatic."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Despite progress in dystrophin-targeted gene therapies, it is still a fatal disease requiring novel therapeutics that can be used synergistically or alternatively to emerging gene therapy. Defective autophagy and disorganized microtubule networks contribute to dystrophic pathogenesis, yet the mechanisms by which microtubule alterations regulate autophagy remain elusive. The present study was designed to uncover possible mechanisms underpinning the role of microtubules in regulating autophagy in dystrophic mice. Mdx mice were also supplemented with Tubastatin A, a pharmacological inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6, and pathophysiology was assessed. Mdx mice with a genetic deletion of the Nox-2 scaffolding subunit p47<sup>phox</sup> were used to assess redox dependence on tubulin acetylation. Our data show decreased acetylation of α-tubulin with enhanced histone deacetylase 6 expression. Tubastatin A increases tubulin acetylation and Q-SNARE complex formation but does not alter microtubule organization or density, indicating improved autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Tubastatin A increases the acetylation of peroxiredoxin and protects it from hyper-oxidation, hence modulating intracellular redox status in mdx mice. Tubastatin A reduces muscle damage and enhances force production. Genetic down regulation of Nox2 activity in the mdx mice promotes autophagosome maturation but not autolysosome formation. Our data highlight that autophagy is differentially regulated by redox and acetylation in mdx mice. By improving autophagy through promoting tubulin acetylation, Tubastatin A decreases the dystrophic phenotype and improves muscle function, suggesting a great potential for clinical translation and treating dystrophic patients."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies encompass a heterogeneous group of rare neuromuscular diseases characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Among these, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) stands out as one of the most severe forms. The present study employs an integrative approach combining network pharmacology, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy calculations to identify potential therapeutic targets and natural compounds for DMD. Upon analyzing the GSE38417 dataset, it was found that individuals with DMD exhibited 290 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to healthy controls. By utilizing gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, this study provides insights into the functional roles of the identified DEGs, identifying ten hub genes that play a critical role in the pathology of DMD. These key genes include DMD, TTN, PLEC, DTNA, PKP2, SLC24A, FBXO32, SNTA1, SMAD3, and NOS1. Furthermore, through the use of ligand-based pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening, three natural compounds were identified as potential inhibitors. Among these, compounds 3874518 and 12314417 have demonstrated significant promise as an inhibitor of the SMAD3 protein, a crucial factor in the fibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms associated with DMD. The therapeutic potential of the compounds was further supported by molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis. These findings suggest that the compounds are viable candidates for experimental validation against DMD."

These cognitive deficits have been related to the absence of dystrophin in specific regions of the central nervous system, notably cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Dystrophin has recently been involved in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors clustering at postsynaptic densities, and its absence, by disrupting this clustering, leads to decreased inhibitory input to PC. We performed an in vivo electrophysiological study of the dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy X-linked (mdx) mouse model of DMD to compare PC firing and local field potential (LFP) in alert mdx and control C57Bl/10 mice. We found that the absence of dystrophin is associated with altered PC firing and the emergence of fast (~160-200 Hz) LFP oscillations in the cerebellar cortex of alert mdx mice. These abnormalities were not related to the disrupted expression of calcium-binding proteins in cerebellar PC. We also demonstrate that cerebellar long-term depression is altered in alert mdx mice. Finally, mdx mice displayed a force weakness, mild impairment of motor coordination and balance during behavioural tests. These findings demonstrate the existence of cerebellar dysfunction in mdx mice. A similar cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in patients with DMD."

    "title": "In Silico Structural Prediction for the Generation of Novel Performant Midi-Dystrophins Based on Intein-Mediated Dual AAV Approach.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a pediatric disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and premature death, and has no current cure. The current, most promising therapeutic avenue is based on gene replacement mediated by adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) using a shortened, but still functional, version of dystrophin, known as micro-dystrophin (µDys), to fit AAV capacity. The limited improvements observed in clinical trials suggest a sub-optimal performance of µDys in the human context that could be due to the lack of key domains in the protein. Therefore, expressing larger dystrophin proteins may be necessary for a more complete correction of the disease phenotype. In this study, we developed three novel midi-dystrophin constructs using a dual-AAV approach, leveraging split-intein-based protein trans-splicing. The midi-dystrophins include additional domains compared to µDys, such as the central cytoskeleton-binding domain, nNOS and Par1b interacting domains, and a complete C-terminal region. Given the limited capacity of each AAV vector, we strategically partially reduced hinge regions while ensuring that the structural stability of the protein remains intact. We predicted the interactions between the two halves of the split midi-Dys proteins thanks to the deep learning algorithm AphaFold3. We observed strong associations between the N- and C-termini in midi-Dys 1 and 2, while a weaker interaction in midi-Dys 3 was revealed. Our subsequent experiments confirmed the efficient protein trans-splicing both in vitro and in vivo in DBA2/mdx mice of the midi-Dys 1 and 2 and not in midi-Dys 3 as expected from the structural prediction. Additionally, we demonstrated that midi-Dys 1 and 2 exhibit significant therapeutic efficacy in DBA2/mdx mice, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents for DMD. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of deep learning-based structural modeling for the generation of intein-based dystrophin versions and pose the basis for further investigation of these new midi-dystrophins versions for clinical studies."

    "title": "Macrophages in the Context of Muscle Regeneration and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Macrophages are essential to muscle regeneration, as they regulate inflammation, carry out phagocytosis, and facilitate tissue repair. These cells exhibit phenotypic switching from pro-inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) states during muscle repair, influencing myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and myofiber formation. In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), asynchronous muscle injuries disrupt the normal temporal stages of regeneration, leading to fibrosis and failed regeneration. Altered macrophage activity is associated with DMD progression and physiopathology. Gaining insight into the intricate relationship between macrophages and muscle cells is crucial for creating effective therapies aimed at treating this muscle disorder. This review explores the dynamic functions of macrophages in muscle regeneration and their implications in DMD."

LGMDR9 is the fourth most common hereditary Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy in Italy. LGMDR9 patients with severe disease show an overlapping Duchenne/Becker phenotype and may have secondary dystrophin reduction on muscle biopsy. We conducted a molecular analysis of the <i>FKRP</i> gene by direct sequencing in 153 patients from Southern Italy (Calabria) with Duchenne/Becker-like phenotypes without confirmed genetic diagnosis. Mutational screening of the patients (112 men and 41 women, aged between 5 and 84 years), revealed pathogenic variants in 16 subjects. The most frequent variants identified were c.427C > A, p.R143S, and c.826C > A, p.L276I (NM_024301.5). The results obtained show that the Duchenne/Becker-like phenotype is frequently determined by mutations in the <i>FKRP</i> gene in our cohort and highlight the importance of considering LGMDR9 in the differential diagnosis of dystrophinopathies in Calabria. Finally, this study, which, to our knowledge, is the first conducted on Calabrian subjects, will contribute to the rapid identification and management of LGMDR9 patients."

    "abstract": "Zinc plays a crucial role in cell structure and functionality. Neurodegenerative Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) alters muscle membrane structure, leading to a loss of muscle mass and strength. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in phase angle (PA) and bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) results in patients with DMD after oral zinc supplementation. This clinical trial included 33 boys aged 5.6 to 24.5 years diagnosed with DMD. They were divided into three groups according to age (G1, G2, and G3) and supplemented with oral zinc. The mean serum zinc concentration was 74 μg/dL, and 29% of patients had concentrations below the reference value. The baseline values (mean (standard deviation)) of the bioelectrical impedance parameters PA, resistance (R), and reactance (Xc) were 2.59° (0.84°), 924.36 (212.31) Ω, and 39.64 (8.41) Ω, respectively. An increase in R and a decrease in PA and lean mass proportional to age were observed, along with a negative correlation (r = -0.614; <i>p</i> < 0.001) between age and PA. The average cell mass in G1 was greater than that in G3 (<i>p</i> = 0.012). There were no significant differences in serum zinc levels or bioelectrical impedance parameters before and after zinc supplementation. We conclude that this population is at risk of zinc deficiency and the proposed dosage of zinc supplementation was not sufficient to alter serum zinc levels, PA and BIVA results."

    "abstract": "Cytosolic calcium overload contributes to muscle degradation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the primary calcium storage organelle in muscle. The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps cytosolic calcium to the SR during muscle relaxation. Calcium is kept in the SR by calcium-binding proteins. Given the importance of the canine DMD model in translational studies, we examined transcriptional changes of SERCA (SERCA1 and SERCA2a), SERCA regulators (phospholamban, sarcolipin, myoregulin, and dwarf open reading frame), and SR calcium-binding proteins (calreticulin, calsequestrin 1, calsequestrin 2, and sarcalumenin) in skeletal muscle (diaphragm and extensor carpi ulnaris) and heart (left ventricle) in normal and affected male dogs by droplet digital PCR before the onset (≤ 2-m-old), at the active stage (8 to 16-m-old), and at the terminal stage (30 to 50-m-old) of the disease. Since many of these proteins are expressed in a fiber type-specific manner, we also evaluated fiber type composition in skeletal muscle. In affected dog skeletal muscle, SERCA and its regulators were down-regulated at the active stage, but calcium-binding proteins (except for calsequestrin 1) were upregulated at the terminal stage. Surprisingly, nominal differences were detected in the heart. We also examined whether there exists sex-biased expression in 8 to 16-m-old dogs. Multiple transcripts were significantly downregulated in the heart and extensor carpi ulnaris muscle of female dogs. In fiber type analysis, we found significantly more type I fiber in the diaphragm of 8 to 16-m-old affected dogs, and significantly more type II fibers in the extensor carpi ulnaris of 30 to 50-m-old affected dogs. However, no difference was detected between male and female dogs. Our study adds new knowledge to the understanding of muscle calcium regulation in normal and dystrophic canines."

Over 50% have obesity by the teenage years. <b><i>Objectives:</i></b> The current study examines literature on obesity management in DMD and describes how obesity pharmacotherapy can be used in this high-risk cohort. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This review was conducted in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A Pubmed Database search was conducted from January 2000 to May 2024. Included terms were DMD and topiramate, phentermine, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, and liraglutide. Eligible studies were cataloged to examine obesity pharmacotherapy, side effect profiles, and clinical outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Twenty studies met inclusion criteria, 18 on metformin. Reviewed studies varied in duration from 4 to 24 weeks, ages 6.5-44 years old, with 112 participants total (range: 1-30 participants). Included studies were: eight animal studies, six clinical trials, four reviews, one cohort study, and one case report. Primary outcomes varied among studies: muscular degeneration and function (15 articles), cardiac function (2 articles), weight loss (2 articles), and general endocrine care (1 article). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Adjunct obesity pharmacotherapy use in youth with DMD is promising but needs to be confirmed. Large gaps include appropriate agent selection, side effect monitoring, and dose escalation. The overall quality of pediatric-specific evidence for the use of obesity pharmacotherapy in youth with DMD is low. Future research is needed to investigate how to safely utilize these agents."

The investigation focused on DMD/mdx mouse skeletal muscle primary myoblasts, aiming to identify lncRNAs potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Utilizing CLC Genomics Workbench software, 554 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in DMD/mdx mice compared to wild-type (WT) control. Among them, 373 were upregulated, and 181 were downregulated. The study highlighted specific lncRNAs (e.g., 5930430L01Rik, Gm10143, LncRNA1490, LncRNA580) and their potential regulatory roles in DMD key genes like IGF1, FN1, TNNI1, and MYOD1. By predicting miRNA and their connections with lncRNA and mRNA (ceRNA network) using tools such as miRNet, miRSYSTEM and miRCARTA, the study revealed potential indirect regulation of Dystrophin, IGF1R and UTRN genes by identified lncRNAs (e.g. 2310001H17Rik-203, C130073E24Rik-202, LncRNA2767, 5930430L01Rik and LncRNA580). These findings suggest that the identified lncRNAs may play crucial roles in the development and progression of DMD through their regulatory influence on key gene expression, providing valuable insights for potential therapeutic interventions."

Delandistrogene moxeparvovec, an adeno-associated rh74-viral vector-based gene therapy, addresses absent functional dystrophin in DMD. Here the phase 3 EMBARK study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of delandistrogene moxeparvovec in patients with DMD. Ambulatory males with DMD, ≥4 years to <8 years of age, were randomized and stratified by age group and North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score to single-administration intravenous delandistrogene moxeparvovec (1.33 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes per kilogram; n = 63) or placebo (n = 62). At week 52, the primary endpoint, change from baseline in NSAA score, was not met (least squares mean 2.57 (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) versus 1.92 (placebo) points; between-group difference, 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.45, 1.74; P = 0.2441). Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean micro-dystrophin expression at week 12: 34.29% (treated) versus 0.00% (placebo). Other secondary efficacy endpoints at week 52 (between-group differences (95% CI)) included: Time to Rise (-0.64 (-1.06, -0.23)), 10-meter Walk/Run (-0.42 (-0.71, -0.13)), stride velocity 95th centile (0.10 (0.00, 0.19)), 100-meter Walk/Run (-3.29 (-8.28, 1.70)), time to ascend 4 steps (-0.36 (-0.71, -0.01)), PROMIS Mobility and Upper Extremity (0.05 (-0.08, 0.19); -0.04 (-0.24, 0.17)) and number of NSAA skills gained/improved (0.19 (-0.67, 1.06)). In total, 674 adverse events were recorded with delandistrogene moxeparvovec and 514 with placebo. There were no deaths, discontinuations or clinically significant complement-mediated adverse events; 7 patients (11.1%) experienced 10 treatment-related serious adverse events. Delandistrogene moxeparvovec did not lead to a significant improvement in NSAA score at week 52. Some of the secondary endpoints numerically favored treatment, although no statistical significance can be claimed. Safety was manageable and consistent with previous delandistrogene moxeparvovec trials. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05096221."

Consensus was achieved on which of these tools should be used across different settings, ranging from screening to clinical practice and scientific research. Screening questionnaires were found to be valuable not only for providing epidemiological data but also for raising awareness among the Duchenne community and professionals. More standardised and detailed online questionnaires, combined with in-depth clinical assessments can help better identify the profile of brain comorbidities and plan appropriate interventions. Additionally, the information gathered from assessing multiple features of brain involvement can be used to explore correlations with other aspects, such as the regional expression of the different dystrophin isoforms, brain imaging, and the animal models deficient in these isoforms."

Here, we report safety, motor function, and the first pulmonary function results from the open-label, phase II Galactic53 trial of viltolarsen (NCT04956289). Male participants aged ≥ 8 years with DMD received 80 mg/kg intravenous viltolarsen once weekly for 48 weeks. Results from participants receiving viltolarsen were compared with an external control cohort group-matched for multiple variables. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate, 4 were considered treatment-related, and no participants discontinued. Participants receiving viltolarsen experienced clinically meaningful benefits in pulmonary function with higher percent predicted forced vital capacity and higher peak cough flow at Week 49 compared with the control cohort for both ambulatory and nonambulatory participants. Viltolarsen also stabilized upper limb motor function over the Treatment Period. These results support viltolarsen as an important part of the treatment armamentarium for both ambulatory as well as nonambulatory patients with DMD."

Therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides can modulate target gene expression with high specificity through various mechanisms determined by base sequences and chemical modifications; and have shown efficacy in clinical trials for a few rare neurological conditions. Therefore, this review will focus on the applications of antisense oligonucleotides, in particular splice-switching antisense oligomers as promising therapeutics for rare neurological diseases, with key examples of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy.

Rare disease therapies encompass a broad spectrum of interventions, including orphan medicinal products, orphan medical devices, rehabilitative therapies, and digital therapeutics, with the lines between these categories blurring. This paper covers the session of the RE (ACT)-IRDiRC Conference 2023 and delves into the landscape of orphan medical device research and development, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field. It provides a short overview of the different international legislations in the field. In addition, it highlights several exemplary orphan medical devices. The first example is an exoskeleton for boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, enabling them to maintain arm functionality and independence. Another example presented was an EEG device linked to an app detecting seizures in rare epilepsy conditions, which alerts caregivers to seizures in real-time but also facilitates objective seizure reporting for clinicians, aiding in diagnosis and treatment optimization. It also showcases the role of gamification and enabling technologies in addressing rare diseases, by showing a game designed for children with cystic fibrosis, and a telemedicine system for rehabilitation therapy. Both solutions aim to improve patients' understanding of their conditions and enhance their self-management. In conclusion, this paper underscores the critical need for patient-centric orphan and pediatric medical devices to provide therapeutic options for individuals with rare diseases. It highlights the impact of existing devices on enhancing the quality of life for rare disease patients and emphasizes the necessity for greater incentives and support for research and development in this field."

We characterize the morphology, size, particle count, and surface markers (CD9, Alix, and Flotillin) by HR-TEM, NTA, and Western Blot analysis. The mid-IR spectra were recorded from (4000-400 cm<sup>-1</sup>) by Bruker ALPHA II FTIR spectrometer model, which was equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) module. Machine learning algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest (RF) for dimensionality reduction and classifying the two study groups based on the FTIR spectra.

This study aimed to investigate the proportion of patients with DMD requiring gastrostomy and to assess the timing and outcomes of gastrostomy in patients with DMD to optimize perioperative care and improve long-term management. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the medical records of patients with DMD treated between March 1991 and November 2023 at Kobe University Hospital. To identify risk factors for gastrostomy, Fisher's two-tailed test and logistic analysis were used to compare the gastrostomy (group G) and comparison group without gastrostomy (group C) groups. We identified patients >18 years with DMD. We excluded those without medical records from the last decade and those on nasogastric tube feeding. Among the 135 eligible patients, five (median age, 23 years) underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG; uptake rate, 3.7 %), and their data were analyzed for perioperative outcomes. Complications included ventilatory disturbances, aspiration pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. Two patients experienced significant postoperative complications, underscoring the high-risk nature of PEG in this population. Participants' postoperative weight changes varied significantly. The presence or absence of ventilatory management, cardiomyopathy treatment, scoliosis, and steroid treatment were examined as risk factors between groups G and C, but no significant differences were observed. This study highlights low gastrostomy usage among patients with DMD, with varying outcomes. Meticulous planning and early consideration of gastrostomy are crucial to enhance the quality of life and nutritional outcomes in these patients."

In this tutorial, the structural framework, essential controllers, and visualization techniques for analysis are described, along with key code examples such as criteria selection and power calculation. A virtual population was created using a machine learning algorithm to enlarge the available sample size to simulate clinical trial scenarios in the presented tool. In addition, external validation of the simulated outputs was conducted using a placebo arm of a recently published DMD trial.

Deletion of 45-55 DMD exons (del45-55) was described in asymptomatic subjects, but recently serious skeletal and cardiac complications have been reported. Uncovering why a single mutation like del45-55 is able to induce diverse phenotypes and grades of severity may impact the strategies of emerging therapies. Cellular models are essential for this purpose, but their availability is compromised by scarce muscle biopsies. We introduced, as a proof-of-concept, using CRISPR-Cas9 edition, a del45-55 mimicking the intronic breakpoints harboured by a subset of patients of this form of dystrophinopathy (designing specific gRNAs), into a Duchenne patient's cell line. The edited cell line was characterized evaluating the dystrophin expression and the myogenic status. Dystrophin expression was restored, and the myogenic defects were ameliorated in the edited myoblasts harbouring a specific del45-55. Besides confirming the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 to create tailored mutations (despite the low cleavage efficiency of our gRNAs) as a useful approach to generate in vitro models, we also generated an immortalized myoblast line derived from a patient with a specific del45-55.

The median (IQR) creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels at diagnosis were 6296.5 (4320, 7432.5) U/L. The genetic variation in 111 patients were reported as deletion (n = 105), duplication (n = 3), and point variation (n = 3). 22 patients could benefit from the available exon skipping therapy. Exondys (exon 51 skipping) could be used in 14 patients. Deletions were recorded in a much higher proportion of patients compared to previous studies from India. There were 22 patients who could have been benefitted by the available exon skipping therapy."

    "title": "Development of an ultrasound-based metric of muscle functional capacity for use in patients with neuromuscular disease.",
    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are progressive neuromuscular disorders characterized by severe muscle weakness and functional decline (Pillen et al., Muscle Nerve 2008; 37(6):679-693). With new therapeutics, objective methods with increased sensitivity are needed to assess muscle function. Ultrasound imaging is a promising approach for assessing muscle fat and fibrosis in neuromuscular disorders. This study builds on prior work by combining ultrasound-based measurements of muscle size, shape, and quality, relating these measures to muscle strength, and proposing a multivariable image-based estimate of muscle function. Maximum voluntary elbow flexion torque of 36 participants (SMA, DMD, and healthy controls) was measured by hand-held dynamometry and elbow flexor muscles were imaged using ultrasound. Muscle size (cross-sectional area, maximum Feret diameter or width, and thickness), quality (echogenicity, texture anisotropy index), and cross-sectional shape (diameter ratio) were measured. Multivariable regression was used to select ultrasound measurements that predict elbow flexion torque. Significant differences were observed in muscle size (decreased), shape (thinned), and quality (decreased) with increased disease severity and compared to healthy participants. CSA (brachioradialis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51), maximum Feret diameter (biceps R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, brachioradialis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58) and echogenicity (brachioradialis R<sup>2</sup> = 0.61) were most correlated with torque production. Multivariable regression models identified that muscle size (CSA, maximum Feret diameter) and quality (echogenicity) were both essential to predict elbow flexion torque (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65). A multivariable approach combining muscle size and quality improves strength predictions over single variable approaches. These methods present a promising avenue for the development of sensitive and functionally relevant biomarkers of neuromuscular disease."

    "title": "Cardiac MRI in Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is the noninvasive technique of choice for early detection of cardiac involvement in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD, respectively), but is seldom used in routine clinical practice in the Indian context. We sought to determine the prevalence of CMRI abnormalities in patients with DMD and BMD and to compare the CMRI parameters with the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. A prospective, observational study was conducted on patients genetically diagnosed with DMD and BMD who could complete CMRI between March 2020 and March 2022. Abnormal CMRI was the presence of any late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) that signifies myocardial fibrosis (LGE positivity), regional wall motion abnormality, or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF <55%). A total of 46 patients were included: 38 patients with DMD and eight with BMD. Cardiac abnormality was seen in 23 (50%) patients. LGE was more common than impaired LVEF in DMD (16, 42.1%), while impaired LVEF was more common in BMD (5, 62.5%). LGE was most frequently found in lateral wall (18/19) followed by inferior (6/19), septal (5/19), anterior (2/19), and apex (1/19). Among the various clinicodemographic parameters, only age ( r = 0.495, P = 0.002) and disease duration ( r = 0.407, P = 0.011) were found to significantly correlate with LGE in patients with DMD. No association was found between the various CMRI parameters and the genotype. The current study highlights the differences in myocardial fibrosis and LV dysfunction between DMD and BMD, along with other CMRI parameters. Notably, a genotype-CMRI correlation was not found in the current cohort, which needs to be further explored."

    "title": "Predictors of cardiac disease in duchenne muscular dystrophy: a systematic review and evidence grading.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare disease that causes progressive muscle degeneration resulting in life-threatening cardiac complications. The objective of this systematic literature review was to describe and grade the published evidence of predictors of cardiac disease in DMD. The review encompassed searches of Embase, MEDLINE ALL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2022, for predictors of cardiac disease in DMD. The certainty of evidence (i.e., very low to high) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. We included 33 publications encompassing 9,232 patients with DMD. We found moderate- to high-quality evidence that cardiac medication (i.e., ACE inhibitors [enalapril and perindopril], β-blockers [carvedilol], and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [eplerenone]) are significantly associated with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and left ventricular circumferential strain (LVCS). DMD mutations in exons 51 and 52 were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of cardiomyopathy; deletions treatable by exon 53 skipping and mutations in the Dp116 coding region with improved LVEF and prolonged cardiac dysfunction-free survival; and exons 45-50 and 52 with early left ventricular systolic dysfunction (low/very low-quality evidence). We found high-quality evidence that glucocorticoids (deflazacort) are significantly associated with preserved LVEF and improved fractional shortening (FS), and low-quality evidence that glucocorticoids (deflazacort, prednisone, and/or prednisolone) are associated with improved ejection fraction (EF) and lower risk of cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure-related mortality. Full-time mechanical ventilation was found to be significantly correlated with LVEF (low-quality evidence), muscle strength with FS (low-quality evidence), and genetic modifiers (i.e., LTBP4 rs10880 and ACTN3) with LVEF, lower risk of cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dilation (low-quality evidence). Several sources of cardiac disease heterogeneity are well-studied in patients with DMD. Yet, the certainty of evidence is generally low, and little is known of the contribution of non-pharmacological interventions, as well as the impact of different criteria for initiation of specific treatments. Our findings help raise awareness of prevailing unmet needs, shape expectations of treatment outcomes, and inform the design of future research."

    "title": "How do fine and gross motor skills develop in preschool boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?",
    "abstract": "Boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) experience both fine and gross motor problems. Nowadays, early intervention focuses almost exclusively on gross motor skills. We aimed to explore early motor development in preschool boys with DMD and investigate the influence of cognition. Seventeen boys with DMD (11 months- 6 years) were compared to typically developing (TD) peers and followed-up with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III); Peabody developmental motor scales (PDMS-II) and Motor Function Measure (MFM-20). The longitudinal evolution of fine and gross motor skills was investigated using linear mixed effect models (LMM). Cognition was added to the LMM as a covariate. Preschool boys with DMD scored lower compared to TD peers on both fine and gross motor skills (p<0.001). The evolution of motor development was subscale-dependent. A significant influence of cognition was found on different subscales (p= 0.002-0.04). Preschool boys with DMD do not achieve the same functioning level as TD boys. Cognition plays a crucial role in the evolution of motor skills. Our results suggest a shift to a broader psychomotor approach including both fine and gross motor skills, also considering the impact of cognition. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS?: Our study provides a detailed mapping of early fine and gross motor development in preschool boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and describes the influence of cognition on both fine and gross motor skills. Preschool boys with DMD do not achieve the same functioning level compared to typically developing boys. They score significantly lower on both fine and gross motor skills. The evolution of fine and gross motor development was subscale-dependent e.g. a negative-positive evolution was seen for grasping skills, with a tipping point around the age of four; stationary scaled scores decreased followed by a stabilization around the age four to five and locomotion scaled scores remained stable over time. Finally, we also found that cognition plays a crucial role in the evolution of both fine and gross motor skills. These new insights in the evolution of early motor development could be of added value for future clinical trials in young boys with DMD. Subsequently, increased alertness to early symptoms, e.g. developmental delay, may advance the age of diagnosis, as well as associated early intervention."

    "abstract": "Eighteen-lead electrocardiography (18-ECG) includes, in addition to those in standard 12-lead ECG (12-ECG), six additional chest leads: V7-V9 and V3RV5R. Leads V7-V9 require the patient to be in a lateral decubitus position for the electrodes to be attached to the back. Synthesized 18-ECG (syn18-ECG) is a method that only records 12-ECG and uses computational logic to record the posterior wall (V7-V9) and right-sided (V3R-V5R) leads. We review the clinical utility of syn18-ECG in conditions including acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, acute pulmonary embolism, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The syn18-ECG waveform correlates well with the actual 18-ECG waveform, indicating that syn18-ECG is an excellent substitute for 18-ECG, excluding negative T waves. ST elevation in leads V7-V9 has the effect of reducing missed acute coronary syndromes in the posterior wall. In cases of arrhythmia, syn18-ECG can accurately estimate the target site of radiofrequency catheter ablation using a simple algorithm. The use of additional leads in Duchenne muscular dystrophy is expected to provide new insights. To facilitate gaining more knowledge regarding diseases that have not yet been investigated, it is imperative that the cost of syn18-ECG is reduced in the future."

    "title": "The Effects of Growth Hormone Treatment Beyond Growth Promotion in Patients with Genetic Syndromes: A Systematic Review of the Literature.",
    "abstract": "Recombinant human growth hormone therapy (rhGH) has been widely accepted as the safe treatment for short stature in children with such genetic syndromes as Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner or Noonan syndrome. Some patients with short stature and rare genetic syndromes are treated with rhGH as growth hormone-deficient individuals or as children born small for their gestational age. After years of experience with this therapy in syndromic short stature, it has been proved that there are some aspects of long-term rhGH treatment beyond growth promotion, which can justify rhGH use in these individuals. This paper summarizes the data of a literature review of the effects of rhGH treatment beyond growth promotion in selected genetic syndromes. We chose three of the most common syndromes, Prader-Willi, Turner, and Noonan, in which rhGH treatment is indicated, and three rarer syndromes, Silver-Russel, Kabuki, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in which rhGH treatment is not widely indicated. Many studies have shown a significant impact of rhGH therapy on body composition, resting energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, muscle tonus, motor function, and mental and behavioral development. Growth promotion is undoubtedly the primary benefit of rhGH therapy; nevertheless, especially with genetic syndromes, the additional effects should also be considered as important indications for this treatment."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is secondarily accompanied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> excess in muscle fibers. Part of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulates in the mitochondria, contributing to the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and degeneration of muscles. In this work, we assessed the effect of intraperitoneal administration of rhodacyanine MKT077 (5 mg/kg/day), which is able to suppress glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75)-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to mitochondria, on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload of skeletal muscle mitochondria in dystrophin-deficient <i>mdx</i> mice and the concomitant mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to muscle pathology. MKT077 prevented Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload of quadriceps mitochondria in <i>mdx</i> mice, reduced the intensity of oxidative stress, and improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, but had no effect on impaired oxidative phosphorylation. MKT077 eliminated quadriceps calcification and reduced the intensity of muscle fiber degeneration, fibrosis level, and normalized grip strength in <i>mdx</i> mice. However, we noted a negative effect of MKT077 on wild-type mice, expressed as a decrease in the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, SR stress development, ultrastructural disturbances in the quadriceps, and a reduction in animal endurance in the wire-hanging test. This paper discusses the impact of MKT077 modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction on the development of skeletal muscle pathology in <i>mdx</i> mice."

    "abstract": "Despite scientific efforts, there is no cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal, progressive, X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. DMD leads to cardiac and skeletal muscle weakness, resulting in premature death due to cardio-pulmonary complications. We have developed Dystrophin Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cell therapy, DT-DEC01, by fusing human myoblasts from healthy donors and from DMD patients. Preclinical studies on human DEC cells showed increased dystrophin expression and improved cardiac, pulmonary, and skeletal muscle function after intraosseous administration. Our clinical study confirmed the safety and efficacy of DT-DEC01 therapy up to 24 months post-administration. In this study, we conducted in vitro assays to test the composition and potency of DT-DEC01, assessing chimerism level and the presence of dystrophin, desmin, and myosin heavy chain. Myoblast fusion resulted in the transfer of healthy donor mitochondria and the creation of chimeric mitochondria within DT-DEC01. The Pappenheim assay confirmed myotube formation in the final product. This study highlights the unique properties of DT-DEC01 therapy and their relevance to DMD treatment mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The development of sequence-specific precision treatments like CRISPR gene editing therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) requires sequence humanized animal models to enable the direct clinical translation of tested strategies. The current available integrated transgenic mouse model containing the full-length human DMD gene, Tg(DMD)72Thoen/J (hDMDTg), has been found to have two copies of the transgene per locus in a tail-to-tail orientation, which does not accurately simulate the true (single) copy number of the DMD gene. This duplication also complicates analysis when testing CRISPR therapy editing outcomes, as large genetic alterations and rearrangements can occur between the cut sites on the two transgenes. To address this, we performed long read nanopore sequencing on hDMDTg mice to better understand the structure of the duplicated transgenes. Following that, we performed a megabase-scale deletion of one of the transgenes by CRISPR zygotic microinjection to generate a single-copy, full-length, humanized DMD transgenic mouse model (hDMDTgSc). Functional, molecular, and histological characterisation shows that the single remaining human transgene retains its function and rescues the dystrophic phenotype caused by endogenous murine Dmd knockout. Our unique hDMDTgSc mouse model simulates the true copy number of the DMD gene, and can potentially be used for the further generation of DMD disease models that would be better suited for the pre-clinical assessment and development of sequence specific CRISPR therapies."

    "abstract": "Vamorolone has recently been approved for the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy to replace glucocorticosteroids, which theoretically have more side effects. However, its efficacy and safety profile is unclear. We aimed to assess the efficacy of vamorolone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy through the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), time to stand velocity (TTSTAND), time to run 10 m (TTRW), time to climb four stairs (TTCLIMB) and a safety profile. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception to June 2024 (PROSPERO: CRD42024558413) for studies evaluating the effect or safety profile of vamorolone in a population with Duchenne muscular dystrophy on 6MWT, NSAA and TTSTAND. TTRW, TTCLIMB and a safety profile were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool (RoB2) and the Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies with No Control Group from the US National Institutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, depending on the type of design. Results were expressed as mean differences or proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), depending on the outcome. Six studies with a total of 145 individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and a baseline age between 4.7 and 5.5 years were included in the systematic review. Overall, the most effective dose was 6 mg/kg/day. At 24 weeks, this dose showed a statistically significant effect compared with the untreated cohorts of 41.60 m (95% CI 14.30, 68.90) on the 6MWT, 3.57 points (95% CI 1.89, 5.25) on the NSAA, 0.06 events/s (95% CI 0.02, 0.10) on the TTSTAND, approximately 0.25 m/s on the TTRW and 0.04 (95% CI -0.00, 0.08) to 0.07 events/s (95% CI 0.03, 0.11) on the TTCLIMB. There was some discrepancy in the statistical significance of some studies, although the direction of the effect was usually similar. In general, the effect was maintained in the extension studies. Adverse events were less frequent than in historical cohorts treated with glucocorticoids. Finally, the risk of bias in the included studies was low. According to our results, vamorolone offers a statistically and clinically significant benefit in the management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with fewer side effects than glucocorticoids. However, the number of studies limits the interpretability and generalisability of these data, requiring more studies with more participants to perform a meta-analysis."

    "abstract": "A recessive X-linked illness called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by increasing muscle weakening and degradation. It primarily affects boys and is one of the most prevalent and severe forms of muscular dystrophy. Mutations in the <i>DMD</i> gene, which codes for the essential protein dystrophin, which aids in maintaining the stability of muscle cell membranes during contraction, are the cause of the illness. Dystrophin deficiency or malfunction damages muscle cells, resulting in persistent inflammation and progressive loss of muscular mass. The pathophysiology and genetic foundation of DMD are thoroughly examined in this review paper, focusing on the function of the NF-κB signaling system in the disease's progression. An important immune response regulator, NF-κB, is aberrantly activated in DMD, which exacerbates the inflammatory milieu in dystrophic muscles. Muscle injury and fibrosis are exacerbated and muscle regeneration is hampered by the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are produced when NF-κB is persistently activated in muscle cells. The paper also examines our existing knowledge of treatment approaches meant to inhibit the progression of disease by modifying NF-κB signaling. These include new molecular techniques, gene treatments, and pharmacological inhibitors that are intended to lessen inflammation and improve muscle healing. Furthermore covered in the analysis is the significance of supportive care for DMD patients, including physical therapy and corticosteroid treatment, in symptom management and quality of life enhancement. The article seeks to provide a thorough understanding of the mechanisms causing DMD, possible therapeutic targets, and developing treatment options by combining recent research findings. This will provide clinicians and researchers involved in DMD care and research with invaluable insights."

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the body composition of DMD patients before and after zinc supplementation. The study is a clinical trial comprising 21 boys diagnosed with DMD. Dietary intake parameters were evaluated before zinc supplementation. Serum zinc levels, anthropometry, and body composition were measured in three moments, four months apart. The patients received 5, 10, or 15 mg of zinc bis-glycine supplementation according to age as an oral solution daily for four months. The sample was distributed into two groups according to serum zinc status: zinc deficiency (G1) or adequate zinc (G2). There was a significant difference in lean body mass between the groups: zinc deficiency (G1) or adequate zinc (G2), at three times (<i>p</i>=0.041, 0.016, and 0.009, respectively). After oral zinc supplementation, serum zinc levels were not different between groups. We did not observe differences when associating the parameters between times and groups. Zinc supplementation was able to maintain lean body mass and fat mass in patients with DMD with previous deficiencies. Therefore, it is necessary to have a prior screening of serum zinc levels to observe changes after supplementation."

    "abstract": "The approval of splice-switching oligonucleotides with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has advanced the field of oligonucleotide therapy. Despite this progress, PMOs encounter challenges such as poor tissue uptake, particularly in the heart, diaphragm, and central nervous system (CNS), thereby affecting patient's prognosis and quality of life. To address these limitations, we have developed a PMOs-based heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO) technology. This innovation involves a lipid-ligand-conjugated complementary strand hybridized with PMOs, significantly enhancing delivery to key tissues in mdx mice, normalizing motor functions, muscle pathology, and serum creatine kinase by restoring internal deleted dystrophin expression. Additionally, PMOs-based HDOs normalized cardiac and CNS abnormalities without adverse effects. Our technology increases serum albumin binding to PMOs and improves blood retention and cellular uptake. Here we show that PMOs-based HDOs address the limitations in oligonucleotide therapy for DMD and offer a promising approach for diseases amenable to exon-skipping therapy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle-wasting disease. Recently approved molecular/gene treatments do not solve the downstream inflammation-linked pathophysiological issues such that supportive therapies are required to improve therapeutic efficacy and patients' quality of life. Over the years, a plethora of bioactive natural compounds have been used for human healthcare. Among them, plumbagin, a plant-derived analog of vitamin K3, has shown interesting potential to counteract chronic inflammation with potential therapeutic significance. In this work we evaluated the effects of plumbagin on DMD by delivering it as an oral supplement within food to dystrophic mutant of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and mdx mice. In both DMD models, plumbagin show no relevant adverse effect. In terms of efficacy plumbagin improved the climbing ability of the dystrophic flies and their muscle morphology also reducing oxidative stress in muscles. In mdx mice, plumbagin enhanced the running performance on the treadmill and the muscle strength along with muscle morphology. The molecular mechanism underpinning these actions was found to be the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway, the re-establishment of redox homeostasis and the reduction of inflammation thus generating a more favorable environment for skeletal muscles regeneration after damage. Our data provide evidence that food supplementation with plumbagin modulates the main, evolutionary conserved, mechanistic pathophysiological hallmarks of dystrophy, thus improving muscle function in vivo; the use of plumbagin as a therapeutic in humans should thus be explored further."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle tissue function is governed by the mechanical properties and organization of its components, including myofibers, extracellular matrix, and adipose tissue, which can be modified by the onset and progression of many disorders. This study used a novel combination of quantitative micro-elastography and clearing-enhanced three-dimensional (3D) microscopy to assess 3D micro-scale elasticity and micro-architecture of muscles from two muscular dystrophies: dysferlinopathy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, using male BLA/J and mdx mice, respectively, and their wild-type (WT) controls. We examined three muscles with varying proportions of slow- and fast-twitch myofibers: the soleus (predominantly slow), extensor digitorum longus (EDL; fast), and quadriceps (mixed), from BLA/J and WT<sub>BLA/J</sub> mice aged 3, 10, and 24 months, and mdx and WT<sub>mdx</sub> mice aged 10 months. Both dysferlin deficiency and age reduced the elasticity and variability of elasticity of the soleus and quadriceps, but not EDL. Overall, the BLA/J soleus was 20% softer than WT and less mechanically heterogeneous (-14% in standard deviation of elasticity). The BLA/J quadriceps at 24 months was 72% softer than WT and less mechanically heterogeneous (-59% in standard deviation), with substantial adipose tissue accumulation. While mdx muscles did not differ quantitatively from WT, regional heterogeneity was evident in micro-scale elasticity and micro-architecture of quadriceps (e.g., 11.2 kPa in a region with marked pathology vs 3.8 kPa in a less affected area). These results demonstrate differing biomechanical changes in hind-limb muscles of two distinct muscular dystrophies, emphasizing the potential for this novel multimodal technique to identify important differences between various myopathies."

In a fortuitous evolution of work on regenerative medicine, my coworkers and I inverted the RNA drug discovery process: first we identified natural disease-modifying ncRNAs, then used them as templates for new synthetic RNA drugs. Mechanism was probed only after bioactivity had been demonstrated. The journey began with the development of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) for cardiac regeneration. While testing CDCs in a first-in-human trial, we discovered they worked indirectly: ncRNAs within CDC-secreted extracellular vesicles mediate the therapeutic benefits. The vast majority of such ncRNAs are fragments of unknown function. We chose several abundant ncRNA species from CDC-secreted extracellular vesicles, synthesized and screened each of them in vitro and in vivo. Those with exceptional disease-modifying bioactivity inspired new chemical entities that conform to the structural conventions of the Food and Drug Administration-approved ncRNA armamentarium. This discovery arc-Cell-Derived RNA from Extracellular vesicles for bioinspired Drug develOpment, or CREDO-has yielded various promising lead compounds, each of which works via a unique, and often novel, mechanism. The process relies on emergent insights to shape therapeutic development. The initial focus of our inquiry-CDCs-are now themselves in phase 3 testing for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its associated cardiomyopathy. But the intravenous delivery strategy and the repetitive dosing protocol for CDCs, which have proven key to clinical success, both arose from systematic mechanistic inquiry. Meanwhile, emergent insights have led to multiple cell-free therapeutic candidates: CDC-secreted extracellular vesicles are in preclinical development for ventricular arrhythmias, while the CREDO-conceived RNA drugs are in translation for diseases ranging from myocarditis to scleroderma."

The participation of NRIP in myoblast fusion was demonstrated by cell fusion assay and time-lapse microscopy. The NRIP mutants were generated for mechanism study in NRIP-null C2C12 (termed KO19) cells and muscle-specific NRIP knockout (NRIP cKO) mice. A GEO profile database was used to analyse NRIP expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. In this study, we found that NRIP directly and reciprocally interacted with actin both in vitro and in cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the endogenous NRIP colocalized with components of invadosome, such as actin, Tks5, and cortactin, at the tips of cells during C2C12 differentiation. The KO19 cells were generated and exhibited a significant deficit in myoblast fusion compared with wild-type C2C12 cells (3.16% vs. 33.67%, p < 0.005). Overexpressed NRIP in KO19 cells could rescue myotube formation compared with control (3.37% vs. 1.00%, p < 0.01). We further confirmed that NRIP directly participated in cell fusion by using a cell-cell fusion assay. We investigated the mechanism of invadosome formation for myoblast fusion, which depends on NRIP-actin interaction, by analysing NRIP mutants in NRIP-null cells. Loss of actin-binding of NRIP reduced invadosome (enrichment ratio, 1.00 vs. 2.54, p < 0.01) and myotube formation (21.82% vs. 35.71%, p < 0.05) in KO19 cells and forced NRIP expression in KO19 cells and muscle-specific NRIP knockout (NRIP cKO) mice increased myofibre size compared with controls (over 1500 μm<sup>2</sup>, 61.01% vs. 20.57%, p < 0.001). We also found that the NRIP mRNA level was decreased in DMD patients compared with healthy controls (18 072 vs. 28 289, p < 0.001, N = 10 for both groups). NRIP is a novel actin-binding protein for invadosome formation to induce myoblast fusion."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common and disabling childhood genetic diseases. The course of DMD involves progressive muscular degeneration and weakness, leading to functional decline. The Performance of the Upper Limb scale (PUL) is a specific instrument designed to assess the upper limb function of patients with DMD. To adapt the PUL cross-culturally to Brazilian Portuguese (PUL-Br) and assess the convergent validity, structural validity, inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency for Brazilian patients with DMD METHODS: The cross-cultural adaptation involved six steps: translation to Brazilian Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese translation synthesis, back-translation to English, back-translation synthesis, an expert committee review, and a pre-final version test (n = 12). The convergent validity of the PUL-Br was evaluated by examining its correlation to the Motor Function Measure scale (MFM) using 30 patients with DMD. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to assess structural validity. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) verified the PUL-Br interrater reliability. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to verify internal consistency. The PUL was cross-culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. A strong and positive correlation was found between the PUL-Br total score and the total score on the MFM (r = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.91). The PUL-Br showed a satisfactory fit of the data to the three-factor model, excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC: 0.94), and good internal consistency (Cronbach's: 0.91). The PUL-Br is valid and reliable for assessing the upper limb function of Brazilian patients with DMD."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to quantify somatosensory profiles in individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We included 28 participants with genetically confirmed DMD (aged 8-17 years), 14 with chronic pain (DMD-CP), and 14 without pain (DMD-NP), compared to 13 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and sex. Three quantitative sensory testing (QST) modalities were examined: pressure pain threshold (PPT), temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). Characteristics related to chronic pain, fatigue, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life were assessed using questionnaires. Decreased PPTs were found in both DMD cohorts across body areas commonly affected by pain (rectus femoris, medial gastrocnemius, paraspinal muscles, upper trapezius), as well as in a less frequently affected remote area (thenar eminence), compared to HCs (p < 0.001). The DMD-CP group exhibited greater TSP compared to HCs (p = 0.025). There were no differences in CPM effects between DMD groups and HCs. No differences were detected in all QST measures between DMD-CP and DMD-NP. This study is the first to explore the somatosensory profile in DMD. Preliminary evidence suggests that generalized hyperalgesia may be a common feature in DMD regardless of pain status. QST measures appear to not distinguish individuals with chronic pain from those without and thus are not recommended for assessing pain in DMD or guiding treatment."

Several ASO drugs have now reached market approval for these diseases and many more are currently under clinical evaluation. Among them, ASOs made of the tricyclo-DNA originally developed by Christian Leumann have shown particularly interesting properties and demonstrated promise for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this review, we examine the bench to bedside journey of tricyclo-DNA-ASOs from their early preclinical evaluation as fully phosphorotiated-ASOs to the latest generation of lipid-conjugated-ASOs. Finally we discuss the remaining challenges of ASO-mediated exon-skipping therapy for DMD and future perspectives for this promising chemistry of ASOs."

The Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS) was developed to assess trunk control in children with cerebral palsy. We aimed to examine the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the TCMS for children with DMD. We determined the functional level of 52 children with DMD (median age: 8.83 years) with the Vignos Scale, and we further evaluated them with the Motor Function Measure (MFM), a gold standard for determining the validity of the TCMS. Internal consistency of the Turkish TCMS was excellent with a Cronbach's alpha of .95. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for intra-rater reliability were between 0.90-0.96 and for inter-rater reliability were between 0.91-0.95. We reported positive moderate to strong correlations between the TCMS and trunk flexors strength (<i>p</i> < .001, r = 0.77), back extensors strength (<i>p</i> < .001, r = 0.68) and MFM (<i>p</i> < .001, r = 0.85). Thus, we found the Turkish version of TCMS to be a reliable and valid instrument for assessing trunk control of children with DMD in clinical and research settings."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies represent a group of disorders characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. An important subgroup are the dystrophin-related muscular dystrophies caused by variants in the DMD gene. They can be divided into the more severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the milder Becker muscular dystrophy. Here, we characterize the clinical, histopathological and molecular genetic aspects of two male Entlebucher Mountain Dogs with clinical signs of muscular dystrophy. The two dogs presented with marked dysphagia starting at the age of several weeks and in the later course recognizable exercise intolerance with highly increased serum creatine kinase levels. Histopathological signs of a dystrophic myopathy represented by degeneration of muscle fibers and signs of regeneration were present. Whole genome sequencing of one affected dog identified an intragenic 8.6 kb duplication in the X-chromosomal DMD gene, c.7528-4048_7645 + 4450dup. No other protein-changing variants in candidate genes for muscular dystrophy were identified. The duplication includes exon 52 of DMD and is predicted to lead to a frameshift and truncation of 30% of the wild-type open reading frame. Genotyping of the whole family confirmed the presence of the mutant allele in both affected dogs and the unaffected dam. The correct co-segregation of the mutant allele in the affected family as well as knowledge from humans and other species suggest the identified DMD variant as the most likely candidate variant for the muscular dystrophy phenotype in the two investigated dogs."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Muscle fibers rely on the coordination of multiple cell types for repair and regenerative capacity. To elucidate the cellular and molecular changes in these cell types under pathologic conditions, we generated a rhesus monkey model for DMD that displays progressive muscle deterioration and impaired motor function, mirroring human conditions. By leveraging these DMD monkeys, we analyzed freshly isolated muscle tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our analysis revealed changes in immune cell landscape, a reversion of lineage progressing directions in fibrotic fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), and TGF-β resistance in FAPs and muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Furthermore, MuSCs displayed cell-intrinsic defects, leading to differentiation deficiencies. Our study provides important insights into the pathogenesis of DMD, offering a valuable model and dataset for further exploration of the underlying mechanisms, and serves as a suitable platform for developing and evaluating therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an incurable neuromuscular disease leading to progressive skeletal muscle weakness and fatigue. Cell transplantation in murine models has shown promise in supplementing the lack of the dystrophin protein in DMD muscles. However, the establishment of novel, long-term, relevant methods is needed to assess its efficiency on the DMD motor function. By applying newly developed methods, this study aimed to evaluate the functional and molecular effects of cell therapy-mediated dystrophin supplementation on DMD muscles. Dystrophin was supplemented in the gastrocnemius of a 5-week-old immunodeficient DMD mouse model (Dmd-null/NSG) by intramuscular xenotransplantation of healthy human immortalized myoblasts (Hu5/KD3). A long-term time-course comparative study was conducted between wild-type, untreated DMD, and dystrophin supplemented-DMD mouse muscle functions and histology. A novel GO-ATeam2 transgenic DMD mouse model was also generated to assess in vivo real-time ATP levels in gastrocnemius muscles during repeated contractions. We found that 10.6% dystrophin supplementation in DMD muscles was sufficient to prevent low values of gastrocnemius maximal isometric contraction torque (MCT) at rest, while muscle fatigue tolerance, assessed by MCT decline after treadmill running, was fully ameliorated in 21-week-old transplanted mice. None of the dystrophin-supplemented fibers were positive for muscle damage markers after treadmill running, with 85.4% demonstrating the utilization of oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, ATP levels in response to repeated muscle contractions tended to improve, and mitochondrial activity was significantly enhanced in dystrophin supplemented-fibers. Cell therapy-mediated dystrophin supplementation efficiently improved DMD muscle functions, as evaluated using newly developed evaluation methods. The enhanced muscle fatigue tolerance in 21-week-old mice was associated with the preferential regeneration of damage-resistant and oxidative fibers, highlighting increased mitochondrial activity, after cell transplantation. These findings significantly contribute to a more in-depth understanding of DMD pathogenesis."

    "abstract": "The pathology in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by degenerating muscle fibers, inflammation, fibro-fatty infiltrate, and edema, and these pathological processes replace normal healthy muscle tissue. The mdx mouse model is one of the most commonly used preclinical models to study DMD. Mounting evidence has emerged illustrating that muscle disease progression varies considerably in mdx mice, with inter-animal differences as well as intra-muscular differences in pathology in individual mdx mice. This variation is important to consider when conducting assessments of drug efficacy and in longitudinal studies. We developed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation and analysis pipeline to rapidly and non-invasively measure the severity of muscle disease in mdx mice. Wildtype and mdx mice were imaged with MRI and T2 maps were obtained axially across the hindlimbs. A neural network was trained to rapidly and semi-automatically segment the muscle tissue, and the distribution of resulting T2 values was analyzed. Interdecile range and Pearson Skew were identified as biomarkers to quickly and accurately estimate muscle disease severity in mice. The semiautomated segmentation tool reduced image processing time approximately tenfold. Measures of Pearson skew and interdecile range based on that segmentation were repeatable and reflected muscle disease severity in healthy wildtype and diseased mdx mice based on both qualitative observation of images and correlation with Evans blue dye uptake. Use of this rapid, non-invasive, semi-automated MR image segmentation and analysis pipeline has the potential to transform preclinical studies, allowing for pre-screening of dystrophic mice prior to study enrollment to ensure more uniform muscle disease pathology across treatment groups, improving study outcomes."

Also, we investigated atrial electromechanical delay, which has not been previously studied in DMD patients. Mitral, septal, and tricuspid segments were analyzed by TDI. The mean age was 13.6 ± 2.5 years (range, 9.3-17.9 years) in the patient group and 12.8 ± 2.6 years (range, 8-17.5 years) in the control group (P = .1). Patients had higher heart rates, longer QTc intervals, and P-wave dispersion (PWD) than controls (P < .001, P = .004, P < .001, respectively). The patient group had larger left ventricular end-systolic dimension (P < .001), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) (P < .001), MAPSE (P < .001), TAPSE (P < .001), and mitral-E/A (P = .029) values than control subjects. Myocardial performance index (P < .001) was higher, and the E'/A' ratio (P < .001) was lower at all 3 segments in the patient group. Also, atrial electromechanical delay was longer in the patient group at these segments (P < .001). Patients had significantly longer interatrial (P = .033) electromechanical conduction delays. EF was negatively correlated with atrial conduction time variables. We have shown deterioration in systolic and diastolic function in both ventricles, PWD, and atrial conduction in children with DMD. Patients with DMD may be at risk of atrial arrhythmias due to disturbed atrial conduction."

These studies included individuals treated and not treated with corticosteroids and multiple sites with potentially varying standards of care. We aimed to assess genotype-phenotype correlations for age at loss of ambulation (LoA) in a large cohort of individuals with DMD treated with corticosteroids at one center. In this retrospective review of medical records, encounters were included for individuals diagnosed with DMD if prescribed corticosteroids, defined as daily deflazacort or prednisone or high-dose weekend prednisone, for 12 consecutive months. Encounters were excluded if the participants were taking disease-modifying therapy. Data were analyzed using survival analysis for LoA and Fisher's exact tests to assess the percentage of late ambulatory (>14 years old) individuals for selected genotypes. Overall, 3948 encounters from 555 individuals were included. Survival analysis showed later age at LoA for exon 44 skip amenable (p = .004), deletion exons 3-7 (p < .001) and duplication exon 2 (p = .043) cohorts and earlier age at LoA for the exon 51 skip amenable cohort (p < .001) when compared with the rest of the cohort. Individuals with deletions of exons 3-7 had significantly more late ambulatory individuals than other cohorts (75%), while those with exon 51 skip amenable deletions had significantly fewer (11.9%) compared with other cohorts. This confirms previous observations of genotype-phenotype correlations in DMD and enhances information for trial design and clinical management."

Upon presentation, a substantially elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level of 19.8 μg/L and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) results were detected. Further cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) showed myocardial inflammation with localized T2 hyperintensity from the basal to middle lateral and inferior walls, as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) from the basal to apical inferior lateral walls, supporting a diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Subsequently, the patient showed clinical improvement in response to combination treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, oral prednisolone acetate, potassium chloride sustained-release tablets, anti-heart failure medication, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. We report a rare case of acute myocarditis in a patient with DMD, potentially due to upper respiratory tract infection.

However, the pathogenicity of complex rearrangements involving DMD, especially segmental duplications with unknown breakpoints, is not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate the structure, pattern, and potential impact of rearrangements involving DMD duplication. Two families with DMD segmental duplications exhibiting phenotypical differences were recruited. Optical genome mapping (OGM) was used to explore the cryptic pattern of the rearrangements. Breakpoints were validated using long-range polymerase chain reaction combined with next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. A multi-copy duplication involving exons 64-79 of DMD was identified in Family A without obvious clinical symptoms. Family B exhibited typical DMD neuromuscular manifestations and presented a duplication involving exons 10-13 of DMD. The rearrangement in Family A involved complex in-cis tandem repeats shown by OGM but retained a complete copy (reading frame) of DMD inferred from breakpoint validation. A reversed insertion with a segmental repeat was identified in Family B by OGM, which was predicted to disrupt the normal structure and reading frame of DMD after confirming the breakpoints. Validating breakpoint and rearrangement pattern is crucial for the functional annotation and pathogenic classification of genomic structural variations. OGM provides valuable insights into etiological analysis of DMD/BMD and enhances our understanding for cryptic effects of complex rearrangements."

However, the current TadA variants demonstrate a preference for base editing in DNA with specific motif sequences and possess dual deaminase activity, acting on both cytosine and adenosine in adjacent positions, limiting their application scope. To address these issues, we employ TadA orthologs screening and multi sequence alignment (MSA)-guided protein engineering techniques to create a highly effective cytosine base editor (aTdCBE) without motif and adenosine deaminase activity limitations. Notably, the delivery of aTdCBE to a humanized mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mice achieves robust exon 55 skipping and restoration of dystrophin expression.

Recent findings have uncovered the importance of glycogen metabolism in the brain, sustaining a myriad of physiological functions and linking its perturbation to central nervous system (CNS) pathology. This link resulted in classification of neurological-GSDs (n-GSDs), a group of diseases with shared deficits in neurological glycogen metabolism. The n-GSD patients exhibit a spectrum of clinical presentations with common etiology while requiring tailored therapeutic approaches from the traditional GSDs. Recent research has elucidated the genetic and biochemical mechanisms and pathophysiological basis underlying different n-GSDs. Further, the last decade has witnessed some promising developments in novel therapeutic approaches, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), small molecule drugs, and gene therapy targeting key aspects of glycogen metabolism in specific n-GSDs. This preclinical progress has generated noticeable success in potentially modifying disease course and improving clinical outcomes in patients. Herein, we provide an overview of current perspectives on n-GSDs, emphasizing recent advances in understanding their molecular basis, therapeutic developments, underscore key challenges and the need to deepen our understanding of n-GSDs pathogenesis to develop better therapeutic strategies that could offer improved treatment and sustainable benefits to the patients."

Although some have used pharmacologic stress to stimulate injury and enhance cardiac pathology in the mdx model, many methods lead to high mortality with variable cardiac outcomes, and do not recapitulate the structural and functional cardiac changes seen in human disease. Here, we describe a simple and effective method to enhance the cardiac phenotype model in mdx mice using advanced 2D and 4D high-frequency ultrasound to monitor cardiac dysfunction progression in vivo. mdx and wild-type mice received daily low-dose (2 mg/kg/day) isoproterenol injections for 10 days. Histopathological assessment showed that isoproterenol treatment increased myocyte injury, elevated serum cardiac troponin I levels and enhanced fibrosis in mdx mice. Ultrasound revealed reduced ventricular function, decreased wall thickness, increased volumes and diminished cardiac reserve in mdx compared to wild-type mice. Our findings highlight the utility of challenging mdx mice with low-dose isoproterenol as a valuable model for exploring therapies targeting DMD-associated cardiac pathologies."

Additionally, longitudinal changes in DMD patients were evaluated. Five DMD patients from the Yumen Bionics pioneer program and five HCs participated. Two submaximal tests simulating drinking and reaching were performed for two minutes, each with and without DAS. DMD participants completed these tests twice, at baseline (T0) and after 6-9 months (T1), while HCs completed them once. Physical fatigability was measured by the number of repetitions and changes in surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude. Subjective fatigue was assessed using the Borg Scale (6-20) Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). DMD participants generally performed more repetitions with the DAS than without. HCs showed similar or increased repetitions with the DAS. Assessing fatigability with sEMG was difficult due to the compensatory mechanisms used for the tests. Subjective fatigue scores on the Borg Scale were lower with the DAS for both DMD patients and HCs. The Yumen 'EXone' DAS effectively reduces both fatigue and fatigability in DMD patients and healthy controls. Despite the methodological shortcomings, this research is one of the first studies investigating the impact of DAS on fatigue and fatigability."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular dystrophy (DMD), a yet-incurable X-linked recessive disorder that results in muscle wasting and loss of ambulation is due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. Exonic duplications of dystrophin gene are a common type of mutations found in DMD patients. In this study, we utilized a single guide RNA CRISPR strategy targeting intronic regions to delete the extra duplicated regions in patient myogenic cells carrying duplication of exon 2, exons 2-9, and exons 8-9 in the DMD gene. Immunostaining on CRISPR-corrected derived myotubes demonstrated the rescue of dystrophin protein. Subsequent RNA sequencing of the DMD cells indicated rescue of genes of dystrophin related pathways. Examination of predicted close-match off-targets evidenced no aberrant gene editing at these loci. Here, we further demonstrate the efficiency of a single guide CRISPR strategy capable of deleting multi-exon duplications in the DMD gene without significant off target effect. Our study contributes valuable insights into the safety and efficacy of using single guide CRISPR strategy as a potential therapeutic approach for DMD patients with duplications of variable size."

    "abstract": "Striated muscles are essential for locomotion and survival. Their function and structure are highly conserved across taxa. Muscles are highly plastic. Muscle growth can occur through several distinct processes including developmental, allometric, and hypertrophic growth. Additionally, pathological conditions like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) can lead to abnormal muscle growth. While human muscle studies have revealed complex structural adaptations such as sarcomere branching, these processes remain less explored in model organisms like <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. In this study, we present an anatomical characterization of muscle growth in <i>C. elegans</i> under various conditions that parallel those in mammalian systems. We examined developmental, allometric, and hypertrophic growth, as well as muscle atrophy in a DMD model, <i>dys-1(eg33)</i>. We find that <i>C. elegans</i> muscles undergo growth patterns similar to those observed in mammals, with region-specific increases in myocyte size, sarcomere number, and band widths under different conditions. Moreover, we report for the first time the presence of sarcomere branching and splitting in <i>C. elegans</i> muscles, phenomena previously described only in vertebrates and Drosophila. We further report that sarcomere branching is modulated by environmental conditions and pathological states, with increased branching in worms raised swimming and reduced branching in dystrophic muscles. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of muscle adaptation and highlight the potential of <i>C. elegans</i> as a model for studying muscle pathologies like DMD, particularly during periods of rapid growth."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, with large deletions being the most common type of mutation. Inversions involving the DMD gene are a less frequent cause of the disorder, largely because they often evade detection by standard diagnostic methods such as multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Our research identified two intrachromosomal inversions involving the dystrophin gene in two unrelated families through Long-read sequencing (LRS). These variants were subsequently confirmed via Sanger sequencing. The first case involved a pericentric inversion extending from DMD intron 47 to Xq27.3. The second case featured a paracentric inversion between DMD intron 42 and Xp21.1, inherited from the mother. In both cases, simple repeat sequences (SRS) were present at the breakpoints of these inversions. Our findings demonstrate that LRS is an effective tool for detecting atypical mutations. The identification of SRS at the breakpoints in DMD patients enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying structural variations, thereby facilitating the exploration of potential treatments."

    "title": "Muscular dystrophy patients show low exercise-induced blood flow in muscles with normal strength.",
    "abstract": "Neuromuscular evaluation increasingly employs muscle ultrasonography to determine muscle thickness, mean grayscale echointensity, and visual semiquantitative echotexture attenuation. However, these measures provide low sensitivity for detection of mild muscle abnormality. Exercise-induced intramuscular blood flow is a physiologic phenomenon, which may be impaired in mildly affected muscles, particularly in dystrophinopathies, and may indicate functional muscle ischemia. We aimed to determine if muscle blood flow is reduced in patients with neuromuscular disorders and preserved muscle strength, and if it correlates with echointensity and digital echotexture measurements. Peak exercise-induced blood flow, echointensity, and echotexture were quantified in the elbow flexor muscles of 15 adult patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and 13 patients with other muscular dystrophies (OMD). These were compared to 17 patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 (CMT1) neuropathy and 21 healthy adults from a previous study. Muscle blood flow was reduced in all patient groups compared to controls, most prominently in BMD patients (p < 0.0001). Echointensity was similarly increased in all patient groups (p < 0.05), while echotexture was reduced only in muscular dystrophy patients (p ≤ 0.002). In BMD, blood flow correlated with echotexture (Pearson r = 0.6098, p = 0.0158) and strength (Spearman r = 0.5471; p = 0.0370). In patients with normal muscle strength, reduced muscle blood flow was evident in all patient groups (p < 0.001), echotexture was reduced in BMD and OMD (p < 0.01), and echointensity was increased in CMT (p < 0.05). Muscle blood flow is a sensitive measure to detect abnormality, even in muscles with normal strength. Increased echointensity may indicate a neurogenic disorder when strength is preserved, while low echotexture suggests a dystrophic disease."

    "abstract": "Treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) is part of the standard of care in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but excess weight gain and height stunting are common side-effects. It is still unclear how these growth-related side-effects affect motor function. This retrospective cohort study utilized 2228 observations from 648 participants in the UK NorthStar database who had growth and ambulation data recorded between 2006 and 2020. Joint modelling was used to analyse the effect of longitudinal growth centiles on loss of ambulation with respect to GC type and regimen. Loss of ambulation was observed in 113 patients. National estimates of loss of ambulation age were updated by GC group and showed no significant association between loss of ambulation risk and absolute growth centile. However, yearly drift in weight and/or height centile had an associated risk effect on loss of ambulation. Over a 2-year period, a yearly drift in weight from the 50th to the 75th, 75th to the 90th and 90th to the 95th centile was associated with 138%, 118% and 64% increased risk of loss of ambulation, respectively. Conversely, a 2-year drift in height from the 50th to the 25th, 25th to the 10th and 10th to the 5th centile was associated with 53%, 49% and 35% decreased risk of loss of ambulation, respectively. Our results suggest a complex relationship between growth and loss of ambulation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy boys on chronic GCs, the first step in understanding the effects of drugs which also affect growth patterns."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder that leads to mobility loss and life-threatening cardiac or respiratory complications. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) envelope statistics imaging, which characterizes fat infiltration and fibrosis in muscles, has been extensively used for DMD evaluations. Notably, changes in muscle microstructures also result in acoustic attenuation, potentially serving as another crucial imaging biomarker for DMD. Expanding upon the reference frequency method (RFM), this study contributes to the field by introducing the robust RFM (RRFM) as a novel approach for ultrasound attenuation imaging in DMD. The RRFM algorithm was developed using an iterative reweighted least squares technique. We conducted standard phantom measurements with a clinical ultrasound system equipped with a linear array transducer to assess the improvement in attenuation estimation bias by RRFM. Additionally, 161 DMD patients, included in both a validation dataset (n = 130) and a testing dataset (n = 31), underwent ultrasound scanning of the gastrocnemius for RRFM-based attenuation imaging. The diagnostic performances for ambulatory functions and discrimination between early and late ambulatory stages were evaluated and compared with those of QUS envelope statistics imaging (involving Nakagami distribution, homodyned K distribution, and entropy values) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The results indicated that the RRFM method more closely matched the actual attenuation properties of the phantom, reducing measurement bias by 50% compared to conventional RFM. The AUROCs for RRFM-based attenuation imaging, used to discriminate between early and late ambulatory stages, were 0.88 and 0.92 for the validation and testing datasets, respectively. These performances significantly surpassed those of QUS envelope statistics imaging (p < 0.05). Ultrasound attenuation imaging employing RRFM may serve as a sensitive tool for evaluating the progression of ambulatory function deterioration, offering substantial potential for the health management and follow-up care of DMD patients."

    "abstract": "Several recent clinical studies have indicated that vamorolone is comparable in effectiveness to glucocorticosteroids for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, there is a lack of extensive data regarding the efficacy and safety of various doses of vamorolone. We conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of different doses of vamorolone in boys with DMD, and compare the safety of vamorolone vs. glucocorticosteroids, prednisone or deflazacort in boys with DMD. We performed systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for vamorolone, glucocorticosteroids, prednisone or deflazacort in boys with DMD. We assessed statistical heterogeneity across trials based on the Newcastle Ottawa scale (NOS) tool test and I<sup>2</sup> values, and mean differences were pooled using the random-effects model. We used traditional meta-analysis to evaluate efficacy and safety of vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/d vs. vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/d and vamorolone vs. prednisone. A network meta-analysis was applied to estimated the safety of vamorolone in comparison to glucocorticosteroids, prednisone and deflazacort. Our meta-analysis were performed using Revman 5.4 software, and our network meta-analysis were performed using Stata/MP 18.0. In the meta-analysis, a total of 193 patients were analyzed across four clinical trials (97 patients receiving vamorolone 2 mg/kg per day; 96 patients receiving vamorolone 2 mg/kg per day). We observed that there were statistically significant differences in boys with DMD between vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/d and vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/d in TTSTANDV (MD = 0.03, 95%CI = 0.00-0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.04), TTRWV (MD = 0.13, 95%CI = 0.08-0.19, <i>p</i> < 0.01), 6MWT (MD = 24.54, 95%CI = 4.46-44.82, <i>p</i> = 0.02), TTCLIMBV (MD = 0.04, 95%CI = 0.01-0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.009), no significant difference in BMI z score (MD = 0.09, 95%CI = -0.03-0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.13). Indirect comparisons derived from network meta-analysis did not show significant differences among vamorolone, glucocorticosteroids, prednisone and deflazacort in BMI z score. Our findings implied that boys with DMD who took vamorolone 6 mg/kg daily instead of 2 mg/kg daily may be safer and have superior motor function. However, more large sample randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our results. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered in the International Prospective Register of Ongoing Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024562916)."

    "abstract": "The prognosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is poor once it develops to the stage of cardiac impairment. Recent studies have demonstrated that electrocardiogram (ECG), which consists of general ECG and vectorcardiogram (VCG), retains an extremely powerful role in the assessment of patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. However, data regarding VCG recordings in DMD and its prognostic value for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of DMD have never been reported. This study aims to describe the characteristics of VCG in children with DMD and to explore the predictive value of VCG for reduced LVEF in children with DMD. A total of 306 patients with a known diagnosis of DMD confirmed by the genetic test were retrospectively enrolled at our hospital between August 2018 and August 2022. This resulted in a total study group of 486 VCG recordings. Among them, 75 DMD patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) later after one year follow-up were prospectively enrolled. The trend of VCG parameters of DMD patients across the different age span were compared with age-matched normal children. Concordance statistic analysis was further performed to assess the validity of VCG parameters in predicting the occurrence of reduced LVEF in patients with DMD. DMD patients have a significantly higher heart rate, R waves in V1, QRS loop percentage in the right anterior quadrant in the horizontal plane (horizontal quadrant II) and QRS loop percentage in the anterior superior quadrant in the sagittal plane (sagittal quadrant IV) than normal children. Concordance statistic (C-statistic) showed an area under the curve of quadrant IV in the sagittal plane of baseline was 0.704. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows that quadrant IV in the sagittal plane of 7.57% was the optimal cutoff with a sensitivity of 53.3% and a specificity of 88.3% for predicting reduced LVEF in DMD patients. Our study firstly showed that QRS loop percentage in the right anterior quadrant in the horizontal plane (horizontal quadrant II) and QRS loop percentage in the anterior superior quadrant in the sagittal plane (sagittal quadrant IV) could be abnormal in DMD boys as early as before 5 years old. Evaluation of the myocardium by VCG in the early age to predict possible cardiac systolic dysfunction may have important implications for the ongoing management of DMD boys."

This study aims to investigate the effects of photobiomodulation by light-emitting diode (LED) therapy on functional, biochemical and morphological parameters in treadmill-trained adult mdx animals. Mdx mice were trained for 30 min of treadmill running at a speed of 12 m/min, twice a week for 4 weeks. The LED therapy (850 nm) was applied twice a week to the quadriceps muscle throughout the treadmill running period. LED therapy improved behavioral activity (open field) and muscle function (grip strength and four limb hanging test). Functional benefits correlated with reduced muscle damage; a decrease in the inflammatory process; modulation of the regenerative muscular process and calcium signalling pathways; and a decrease in oxidative stress markers. The striking finding of this work is that LED therapy leads to a shift from the M1 to M2 macrophage phenotype in the treadmill-trained mdx mice, enhancing tissue repair and mitigating the dystrophic features. Our data also imply that the beneficial effects of LED therapy in the dystrophic muscle correlate with the interplay between calcium, oxidative stress and inflammation signalling pathways. Together, these results suggest that photobiomodulation could be a potential adjuvant therapy for dystrophinopathies."

The objective of this study was to identify how value assessment frameworks may need to be adapted to measure the value to society of DMD therapies. Three stakeholder groups (6 patient advocates, 4 clinicians, 3 health economists; N = 13) participated in semi-structured interviews around the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research's Value Flower, which includes elements to consider within value assessments of healthcare technologies. All stakeholders agreed that traditional value assessment frameworks based on the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are narrow and will undervalue new DMD therapies. All stakeholders expressed some level of concern that using the QALY as a key metric of value discriminates against patients with severe progressive diseases and disabilities. Some stakeholders saw value in using the QALY for cross-disease comparisons in resource-constrained environments if the methodology was appropriate. All stakeholders recommended considering additional elements of value in decision-making around new DMD therapies. These elements reflect: economic and humanistic costs incurred by patients, caregivers, and families with Duchenne, such as indirect out-of-pocket costs, lost productivity, and family spillovers; meaningful attributes for individuals with disabilities and high unmet need, such as severity of disease, value of hope, and real option value; and factors that contribute to improvements in population health, such as insurance value, equity, and scientific spillovers. These findings highlight the need to expand traditional value assessment frameworks and take a holistic approach that incorporates the perspectives of individuals with Duchenne, caregivers, clinicians, and health economists when assessing the societal value of new DMD therapies. Broadening value assessment will prevent restricted or delayed access to therapies for individuals with Duchenne."

This study aimed to evaluate muscle involvement and symptoms in females with dystrophinopathy using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. Controls and females with dystrophinopathy with muscle symptoms of pain, weakness, fatigue, or excessive tightness were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Participants underwent lower extremity MRI to quantify muscle inflammation, replacement by fat, and disease asymmetry. Cardiac MRI, functional ability, muscle symptoms, and serum creatine kinase levels were also evaluated. Six pediatric females with dystrophinopathy (mean age: 11.7 years), 11 adult females with dystrophinopathy (mean age: 41.3 years), and seven controls enrolled. The mean fat fraction was increased in females with dystrophinopathy compared to controls in the soleus (0.11 vs. 0.03, p = .0272) and vastus lateralis (0.16 vs. 0.03, p = .004). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy water T<sub>2</sub>, indicative of muscle inflammation, was elevated in the soleus and/or vastus lateralis in 11 of 17 individuals. North Star Ambulatory Assessment score was lower in the dystrophinopathy group compared to controls (29 vs. 34 points, p = .0428). From cardiac MRI, left ventricle T<sub>1</sub> relaxation times were elevated in females with dystrophinopathy compared to controls (1311 ± 55 vs. 1263 ± 25 ms, p < .05), but ejection fraction and circumferential strain did not differ. Symptomatic females with dystrophinopathy quantitatively demonstrate muscle replacement by fat and inflammation, along with impairments in functional ability and cardiac function. Additional research is needed to evaluate how symptoms and muscle involvement change longitudinally."

Direct estimation of health-related quality of life for patients with DMD is challenging, highlighting the need for proxy measures. This study aims to catalog and compare existing published health state utility estimates for DMD and related conditions. Using two search strategies, relevant utilities were extracted from the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, including health states, utility estimates, and study and patient characteristics. Analysis One identified health states with comparable utility estimates to a set of published US patient population utility estimates for DMD. A minimal clinically important difference of ± 0.03 was applied to each DMD utility estimate to establish a range, and the registry was searched to identify other health states with associated utilities that fell within each range. Analysis Two used pre-defined search terms to identify health states clinically similar to DMD. Mapping was based on the degree of clinical similarity. Analysis One identified 4,308 unique utilities across 2,322 cost-effectiveness publications. The health states captured a wide range of acute and chronic conditions; 34% of utility records were extrapolated for US populations (n = 1,451); 1% were related to pediatric populations (n = 61). Analysis Two identified 153 utilities with health states clinically similar to DMD. The median utility estimates varied among identified health states. Health states similar to the early non-ambulatory DMD phase exhibited the greatest difference between the median estimate of the sample (0.39) and the existing estimate from published literature (0.21). When available estimates are limited, using novel search strategies to identify utilities of clinically similar conditions could be an approach for overcoming the information gap.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive progressive degenerative disease of skeletal muscle, characterized by intramuscular inflammation, muscle regeneration disorder and replacement of muscle with fibroadipose tissue. DMD is caused by the absence of normal dystrophy. Impaired self-renew ability and limited differentiation capacity of satellite cells are proved as main reasons for muscle regeneration failure. The deficiency of estrogen impedes the process of muscle regeneration. However, the role of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) in muscle regeneration is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the role and the pharmacological effect of ERβ activation on muscle regeneration in mdx mice. This study showed that mRNA levels of ERβ and myogenic-related genes both witnessed increasing trends in dystrophic context. Our results revealed that treatment with selective ERβ agonist (DPN, diarylpropionitrile) significantly increased myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD-1) level and promoted muscle regeneration in mdx mice. Similarly, in mdx mice with muscle-specific estrogen receptor α (ERα) ablation, DPN treatment still promoted muscle regeneration. Moreover, we demonstrated that myoblasts differentiation was accompanied by raised nuclear accumulation of ERβ. DPN treatment augmented the nuclear accumulation of ERβ and, thus, contributed to myotubes formation. One important finding was that forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A), as a pivotal transcription factor in Myod-1 transcription, participated in the ERβ-promoted muscle regeneration. Overall, we offered an interesting explanation about the crucial role of ERβ during myogenesis."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) results in a progressive loss of functional skeletal muscle mass (MM) and replacement with fibrofatty tissue. Accurate evaluation of MM in DMD patients has not previously been available. Our objective was to measure MM using the D<sub>3</sub>creatine (D<sub>3</sub>Cr) dilution method and determine its relationship with strength and functional capacity in patients with DMD over a wide range of ages. Subjects were recruited for participation in a 12 month, longitudinal, observational study. Here, we report the baseline data. A 20 mg dose of D<sub>3</sub>Cr dissolved in water was ingested by 92 patients with DMD (ages 4-25 years) followed later with a fasting urine sample. Enrichment of D<sub>3</sub>creatinine was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score was determined for ambulatory participants, and the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL 2.0) total score and grip strength for all participants. We observed a significant age-associated increase in body weight along with a substantial decrease in MM/body weight (%MM). MM and %MM were associated with PUL score (r = 0.517, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.764, P < 0.0001 respectively). The age-associated decrease in MM and %MM was strongly associated with ambulatory status. We observed very little overlap in %MM between ambulant and non-ambulant subjects, suggesting a threshold of 18-22% associated with loss of ambulation. MM is substantially diminished with advancing age and is highly related to clinically meaningful functional status. The D<sub>3</sub>Cr dilution method may provide a biomarker of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in patients with DMD or other neuromuscular disorders. KEY POINTS: The non-invasive D<sub>3</sub>creatine dilution method provides novel data on whole body functional muscle mass (MM) in a wide range of ages in patients with DMD and reveals profoundly low functional MM in older non-ambulant patients. The difference in %MM between ambulant and non-ambulant subjects suggests a threshold for loss of ambulatory ability between 18 and 22% MM. The data suggest that as functional MM declines with age, maintaining a lower body weight may help to conserve ambulatory ability."

Patients with DMD had lower ABILHAND-Kids scores than their typically-developing peers (p < 0.001). Patients with DMD had higher 9-hole peg test duration on the dominant and non-dominant extremity compared to typically-developing peers (p < 0.001). Patients with DMD were found to be different from their typically-developing peers (p < 0.001) in lateralization response time and accuracy.

In this preliminary study, we explored the ability of 2'-<i>O</i>-methyl-phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) conjugated with lipophilic ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to permeate across intestinal barriers in vitro by a co-culture system of non-contacting IEC-6 cells and DMD myotubes, either alone or encapsulated in exosomes. UDCA was used to enhance the lipophilicity and membrane permeability of ASOs, potentially improving oral bioavailability. Exosomes were employed due to their biocompatibility and ability to deliver therapeutic cargo across biological barriers. Exon skipping was evaluated in the DMD myotubes to reveal the targeting efficiency. Exosomes extracted from milk and wild-type myotubes loaded with 5'-UDC-3'Cy3-ASO and seeded directly on DMD myotubes appear able to fuse to myotubes and induce exon skipping, up to ~20%. Permeation studies using the co-culture system were performed with 5'-UDC-3'Cy3-ASO 51 alone or loaded in milk-derived exosomes. In this setting, only gymnotic delivery induced significant levels of exon skipping (almost 30%) implying a possible role of the intestinal cells in enhancing delivery of ASOs. These results warrant further investigations to elucidate the delivery of ASOs by gymnosis or exosomes."

A significant decrease in FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 values was detected in the supine position in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). All patients had low MIP, MEP, and SNIP measurements (less than 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O). MIP, MEP, and SNIP values were significantly lower in patients with a low BMI than in those without (<i>p</i> < 0.05). To accurately assess respiratory muscle strength, supine FVC should be combined with upright FVC, MIP, MEP, and SNIP measurements. It is crucial to regularly screen patients for nutrition, as this can significantly affect respiratory muscle function during pulmonology follow-up."

    "abstract": "Caveolin is a structural protein within caveolae that may be involved in transmembrane molecular transport and/or various intercellular interactions within cells. Specific mutations of caveolin-3 in muscle fibers are well known to cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Altered expression of caveolin-3 has also been detected in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which may be a part of the pathological process leading to muscle weakness. Interestingly, it has been shown that the renovation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in sarcolemma with muscular dystrophy could improve muscle health, suggesting that NOS may be involved in the pathology of muscular dystrophy. Here, we summarize the notable function of caveolin and/or NOS in skeletal muscle fibers and discuss their involvement in the pathology as well as possible tactics for the innovative treatment of muscular dystrophies."

A total of 312 suspected MD patients were enrolled into the study. The MLPA combined with a targeted myopathy panel were performed. Patients with negative results were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and/or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 275 cases were diagnosed as Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) and 20 cases were other types of myopathy or nonmuscular diseases. Six female DMD/BMD patients suffered from varying degrees of typical DMD-like symptoms and 2 others were suspected to be gonadal mosaicism. The systematic application of WES, WGS, and/or RNA-seq highlighted the need for the detection of variants missed by the current standard diagnostic procedures. The identification of female patients and mosaic carriers was crucial to predict the risk of recurrence and allow for optimal genetic counseling."

    "abstract": "Antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs) are promising treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). They work via induction of exon skipping and restoration of dystrophin protein in skeletal and heart muscles. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) of AOCs comprising antibody-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) depend on several aspects of their component parts. We evaluate the SAR of antimouse transferrin receptor 1 antibody (αmTfR1)-PMO conjugates: cleavable and noncleavable linkers, linker location on the PMO, and the impact of drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs) on plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), oligonucleotide delivery to tissues, and exon skipping. AOCs containing a stable linker with a DAR9.7 were the most effective PMO delivery vehicles in preclinical studies. We demonstrate that αmTfR1-PMO conjugates induce dystrophin protein restoration in the skeletal and heart muscles of <i>mdx</i> mice. Our results show that αmTfR1-PMO conjugates are a potentially effective approach for the treatment of DMD."

    "abstract": "Genetic selection for high growth rate, breast muscle yield, and feed efficiency in modern broilers has been a double-edged sword. While it has resulted in marked benefits in production, it has also introduced widespread incidence of breast muscle myopathies. Broiler myopathies are phenotypically characterized by myodegeneration and fibrofatty infiltration, which compromise meat quality. These lesions resemble those of various myopathies found in humans, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and sarcopenia. Fibroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are interstitial muscle-resident mesenchymal stem cells that are named because of their ability to differentiate into both fibroblasts and adipocytes. This cell population has clearly been established to play a role in the development and progression of myopathies in mice and humans. Gene expression studies of wooden breast and other related disorders have implicated FAPs in broilers, but to our knowledge this cell population have not been characterized in chickens. In this review, we summarize the evidence that FAPs may be a novel, new target for interventions that reduce the incidence and development of chicken breast muscle myopathies."

Here, we aimed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity associated with myonuclei, as well as other mononucleated cell types that underly BMD pathogenesis by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We profiled single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle samples from 7 BMD patients and 3 normal controls. A total of 17,216 nuclei (12,879 from BMD patients and 4,337 from controls) were classified into 13 known cell types, including 9 myogenic lineages and 4 non-myogenic lineages, and 1 unclassified nuclear type according to their cell identities. Among them, type IIx myonuclei were the first to degenerate in response to dystrophin reduction. Differential expression analysis revealed that the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) population had the largest transcriptional changes among all cell types. Sub-clustering analysis identified a significantly compositional increase in the activated FAPs (aFAPs) subpopulation in BMD muscles. Pseudotime analysis, regulon inference, and deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data derived from 29 BMD patients revealed that the aFAPs subpopulation, a distinctive and previously unrecognized mononuclear subtype, was profibrogenic and expanded in BMD patients. Muscle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of the aFAPs markers including LUM, DCN, and COL1A1 in BMD patients were significantly higher than those in controls, respectively. Our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity of human BMD muscle at a single-nucleus resolution and new potential targets for anti-fibrosis therapies in BMD.

    "abstract": "Absence of dystrophin protein causes cardiac dysfunction in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Unlike boys with DMD, the common mouse model of DMD (B10-<i>mdx</i>) does not manifest cardiac deficits until late adulthood. This has limited our understanding of the mechanism and therapeutic approaches to target the pediatric onset of cardiac pathology in DMD. Here we show that the <i>mdx</i> mouse model on the DBA/2J genetic background (D2-<i>mdx</i>) displays juvenile-onset cardiac degeneration. Molecular and histological analysis revealed that cardiac damage in this model is linked to increased leukocyte chemotactic signaling and an inability to resolve inflammation. These deficiencies result in chronic inflammation and fibrotic conversion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the juvenile D2-mdx heart. To address these pathologies, we tested the utility of pro-resolution therapy to clear chronic cardiac inflammation. Use of an N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonist helped physiologically resolve inflammation and mitigate the downstream events that lead to fibrotic degeneration of cardiomyocytes, preventing juvenile onset cardiac muscle loss. These results establish the utility of D2-<i>mdx</i> model to study events associated with pediatric-onset cardiac damage and demonstrates pro-resolution therapy as an alternate to anti-inflammatory therapy for treating cardiac degenerative pathology responsible for cardiomyopathy in DMD patients."

While methods for nitrogen-carbon and nitrogen-heteroatom bond formation have primarily relied on nucleophilic nitrogen atom reactivity, molecules containing nitrogen-halogen bonds allow for electrophilic or radical reactivity modes at the nitrogen center. Despite the growing synthetic utility of nitrogen-halogen bond-containing compounds, selective catalytic strategies for their synthesis are largely underexplored. We recently discovered that the vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are a suitable biocatalyst platform for nitrogen-halogen bond formation. Herein, we show that VHPOs perform selective halogenation of a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N'-halobenzimidamides. This biocatalytic platform is applied to the synthesis of 1,2,4-oxadiazoles from the corresponding N-acylbenzamidines in high yield and with excellent chemoselectivity.

Having detailed data on the natural progression of this condition is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of new drugs. However, there's a lack of data regarding the long-term data on the natural course and how it's managed in China. In this study, we offer a comprehensive overview of clinical and molecular findings, as well as treatment outcomes in the Chinese population. Institutional data on all patients with dystrophinopathy from August 2011 to August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The data included geographic distribution, age at diagnosis, molecular findings, and treatment options, such as corticosteroids, cardiac interventions, and clinical outcomes. In total, 2097 patients with dystrophinopathy, including 1703 cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), 311 cases of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), 46 cases of intermediate muscular dystrophy (IMD), and 37 cases categorized as \"pending\" (individuals with an undetermined phenotype), were registered in the Children's Hospital of Fudan University database for dystrophinopathy from August 2011 to August 2021. The spectrum of identified variants included exonic deletions (66.6%), exonic duplications (10.7%), nonsense variants (10.3%), splice-site variants (4.5%), small deletions (3.5%), small insertions/duplications (1.8%), and missense variants (0.9%). Four deep intronic variants and two inversion variants were identified. Regarding treatment, glucocorticoids were administered to 54.4% of DMD patients and 39.1% of IMD patients. The median age at loss of ambulation was 2.5 years later in DMD patients who received glucocorticoid treatment. Overall, one cardiac medicine at least was prescribed to 7.4% of DMD patients, 8.3% of IMD patients, and 2.6% of BMD patients. Additionally, ventilator support was required by four DMD patients. Eligibility for exon skipping therapy was found in 55.3% of DMD patients, with 12.9%, 10%, and 9.6% of these patients being eligible for skipping exons 51, 53, and 45, respectively. This is one of the largest studies to have evaluated the natural history of dystrophinopathy in China, which is particularly conducive to the recruitment of eligible patients for clinical trials and the provision of real-world data to support drug development."

Children aged 7-16 years with DMD (n = 68) and age-matched typically developing children (n = 33) were included in the study. The cognitive and emotional-behavioural status and the motor functions were assessed in detail. Children with DMD also divided into two groups as \"proximal\" and \"distal\" site mutation groups to compare the cognitive and emotional-behavioural outcomes. The children with DMD and typically developing children were similar in terms of age and body mass index (p > 0.05). Significant differences were found between children with DMD and typically developing peers in almost all subtests of both cognitive and emotional-behavioural assessments (p < 0.05). Cognitive and emotional-behavioural parameters were weakly correlated with specific motor parameters responsive to cognitive functioning (p < 0.05). Children with distal site mutation performed significantly worser than those with proximal site mutation in particular cognitive subtest (p < 0.05). It is concluded that comprehensive and detailed evaluation of cognitive and emotional-behavioural features of children with DMD is essential for better implementation of rehabilitation programs to maintain motor function which especially requires cognitive ability, since a Turkish cohort represented challenges in particular domains of cognitive and emotional-behavioural areas.

Participants were recruited purposively and were interviewed face-to-face and through telephone. The recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Mean age of the children was 13.9 (range: 13-15) at the time of the interviews, and six children had stopped schooling.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial creatine kinase (mtCK) regulates the \"fast\" export of phosphocreatine to support cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADP to ATP which is more rapid than direct ATP export. Such \"creatine-dependent\" phosphate shuttling is attenuated in several muscles, including the heart, of the D2.mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy at only 4 weeks of age. However, the degree to which creatine-dependent and -independent systems of phosphate shuttling progressively worsen or potentially adapt in a hormetic manner throughout disease progression remains unknown. Here, we performed a series of proof-of-principle investigations designed to determine how phosphate shuttling pathways worsen or adapt in later disease stages in D2.mdx (12 months of age). We also determined whether changes in creatine-dependent phosphate shuttling are linked to alterations in mtCK thiol redox state. In permeabilized muscle fibres prepared from cardiac left ventricles, we found that 12-month-old male D2.mdx mice have reduced creatine-dependent pyruvate oxidation and elevated complex I-supported H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission (mH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Surprisingly, creatine-independent ADP-stimulated respiration was increased and mH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was lowered suggesting that impairments in the faster mtCK-mediated phosphocreatine export system resulted in compensation of the alternative slower pathway of ATP export. The apparent impairments in mtCK-dependent bioenergetics occurred independent of mtCK protein content but were related to greater thiol oxidation of mtCK and a more oxidized cellular environment (lower GSH:GSSG). Next, we performed a proof-of-principle study to determine whether creatine-dependent bioenergetics could be enhanced through chronic administration of the mitochondrial-targeting, ROS-lowering tetrapeptide, SBT-20. We found that 12 weeks of daily treatment with SBT-20 (from day 4-∼12 weeks of age) increased respiration and lowered mH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> only in the presence of creatine in D2.mdx mice without affecting calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition activity. In summary, creatine-dependent mitochondrial bioenergetics are attenuated in older D2.mdx mice in relation to mtCK thiol oxidation that seem to be countered by increased creatine-independent phosphate shuttling as a unique form of mitohormesis. Separate results demonstrate that creatine-dependent bioenergetics can also be enhanced with a ROS-lowering mitochondrial-targeting peptide. These results demonstrate a specific relationship between redox stress and mitochondrial hormetic reprogramming during dystrophin deficiency with proof-of-principle evidence that creatine-dependent bioenergetics could be modified with mitochondrial-targeting small peptide therapeutics."

Bone strength may be compromised due to different pathophysiologic mechanisms, including disrupted bone-muscle \"cross-talk\", loss of biomechanical loading, nutritional insufficiency, inadequate weight-bearing physical activity, muscle weakness and/or immobility, and drug treatment. While for Duchenne muscular dystrophy recommendations for evaluation and treatment of bone strength have been published, evidence on bone strength in other hereditary and acquired NMDs is scarce.

This momentum stems from the increasing knowledge regarding the epigenetic factors and networks underlying cell physiology and disease etiology and from the growing realization that genome editing principles involving chromosomal breaks generated by programmable nucleases are prone to unpredictable genetic changes and outcomes. Hence, engineered CRISPR systems are serving as versatile DNA-targeting scaffolds for heterologous and synthetic effector domains that, via locally recruiting transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, seek interfering with loss-of-function and gain-of-function processes underlying recessive and dominant disorders, respectively. Here, after providing an overview about epigenetic drugs and CRISPR-Cas-based activation and interference platforms, we cover the testing of these platforms in the context of molecular therapies for muscular dystrophies.

    "abstract": "Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are specialized cells that reside in adult skeletal muscle poised to repair muscle tissue. The ability of MuSCs to regenerate damaged tissues declines markedly with aging and in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the underlying causes of MuSC dysfunction remain poorly understood. Both aging and disease result in dramatic increases in the stiffness of the muscle tissue microenvironment from fibrosis. MuSCs are known to lose their regenerative potential if cultured on stiff plastic substrates. We sought to determine whether MuSCs harbor a memory of their past microenvironment and if it can be overcome. We tested MuSCs in situ using dynamic hydrogel biomaterials that soften or stiffen on demand in response to light and found that freshly isolated MuSCs develop a persistent memory of substrate stiffness characterized by loss of proliferative progenitors within the first three days of culture on stiff substrates. MuSCs cultured on soft hydrogels had altered cytoskeletal organization and activity of Rho and Rac guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) and Yes-associated protein mechanotransduction pathways compared to those on stiff hydrogels. Pharmacologic inhibition identified RhoA activation as responsible for the mechanical memory phenotype, and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a molecular signature of the mechanical memory. These studies highlight that microenvironmental stiffness regulates MuSC fate and leads to MuSC dysfunction that is not readily reversed by changing stiffness. Our results suggest that stiffness can be circumvented by targeting downstream signaling pathways to overcome stem cell dysfunction in aged and disease states with aberrant fibrotic tissue mechanics."

Carrier females are commonly unaffected but may show signs of dystrophinopathies. In addition, few asymptomatic male carriers with elevated creatine kinase levels have been described possibly related to deletions around exon 48. We now further support this assumed genotype-phenotype correlation by reporting an attenuated phenotype in a three-generation family with a deletion of exon 48 of the DMD gene with clinically unaffected carrier males and females. We confirmed deep intronic breakpoints in this family by genome sequencing, but such data are not available for published cases. Therefore, further observations are needed to clarify genotype-phenotype correlation in this region, since few reports also describe predicted in-frame copy number changes affecting this region in association with classical signs of dystrophinopathies."

As a major secondary event, an abnormal elevation of the intracellular calcium concentration in the dystrophin-deficient muscle contributes to disease progression in DMD. In this study, we investigated the specific functional features of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived muscle cells (hiPSC-skMCs) generated from DMD patients to regulate intracellular calcium concentration. As compared to healthy hiPSC-skMCs, DMD hiPSC-skMCs displayed specific spontaneous calcium signatures with high levels of intracellular calcium concentration. Furthermore, stimulations with electrical field or with acetylcholine perfusion induced higher calcium response in DMD hiPSC-skMCs as compared to healthy cells. Finally, Mn2+ quenching experiments demonstrated high levels of constitutive calcium entries in DMD hiPSC-skMCs as compared to healthy cells. Our findings converge on the fact that DMD hiPSC-skMCs display intracellular calcium dysregulation as demonstrated in several other models. Observed calcium disorders associated with RNAseq analysis on these DMD cells highlighted some mechanisms, such as spontaneous and activated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) releases or constitutive calcium entries, known to be disturbed in other dystrophin-deficient models. However, store operated calcium entries (SOCEs) were not found to be dysregulated in our DMD hiPSC-skMCs model. These results suggest that all the mechanisms of calcium impairment observed in other animal models may not be as pronounced in humans and could point to a preference for certain mechanisms that could correspond to major molecular targets for DMD therapies."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle fibrosis is defined as the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and is a hallmark of muscular dystrophies. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the main source of ECM, and thus have been strongly implicated in fibrogenesis. In skeletal muscle fibrotic models, including muscular dystrophies, FAPs undergo dysregulations in terms of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, however few studies have explored the impact of FAPs migration. Here, we studied fibroblast and FAPs migration and identified lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a signaling lipid central to skeletal muscle fibrogenesis, as a significant migration inductor. We identified LPA receptor 1 (LPA<sub>1</sub>) mediated signaling as crucial for this effect through a mechanism dependent on the Hippo pathway, another pathway implicated in fibrosis across diverse tissues. This cross-talk favors the activation of the Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), leading to increased expression of fibrosis-associated genes. This study reveals the role of YAP in LPA-mediated fibrotic responses as inhibition of YAP transcriptional coactivator activity hinders LPA-induced migration in fibroblasts and FAPs. Moreover, we found that FAPs derived from the mdx4cv mice, a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, display a heightened migratory phenotype due to enhanced LPA signaling compared to wild-type FAPs. Remarkably, we found that the inhibition of LPA<sub>1</sub> or YAP transcriptional coactivator activity in mdx4cv FAPs reverts this phenotype. In summary, the identified LPA-LPA<sub>1</sub>-YAP pathway emerges as a critical driver of skeletal muscle FAPs migration and provides insights into potential novel targets to mitigate fibrosis in muscular dystrophies."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. DMD has effects in early age with significantly shortened lifespan and deteriorated quality of life in the second decade, creating an urgent need to develop better therapeutic options. Corticosteroid medication therapy is an integral tool for the management of DMD and several therapeutic options have been recently approved for use. A comprehensive literature search was completed to examine efficacy and safety profiles of the three corticosteroid medications available for use in DMD patients. The review presents information about the three agents through clinical trials, significant preclinical trials, and comparative studies. Managing DMD takes a multidisciplinary approach, although long-term corticosteroid therapy remains a significant therapeutic tool. Based on the available published studies, unequivocal comparison between the benefits of the three medications cannot yet be made. When selecting a medication for a patient, the decision-making process will most likely rely on the minor differences in the adverse effect profiles. Whichever medication is utilized will surely be a part of a larger regimen that includes other novel therapeutic agents."

    "abstract": "Dystrophinopathies are a group of neuromuscular disorders, inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene. Copy number variation detection and next generation sequencing allow the detection of around 99 % of the pathogenic variants. However, some patients require mRNA studies from muscle biopsies to identify deep intronic pathogenic variants. Here, we report a child suspected of having Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with a muscle biopsy showing dystrophin deficiency, and negative molecular testing for deletions, duplications, and small variants. mRNA analysis from muscle biopsy revealed a pseudoexon activation that introduce a premature stop codon into the reading frame. gDNA sequencing allowed to identified a novel variant, c.832-186 T>G, which creates a cryptic donor splice site, recognizing the underlying mechanism causing the pseudoexon insertion. This case highlights the usefulness of the mRNA analysis from muscle biopsy when routine genetic testing is negative and clinical suspicion of dystrophinopathies remains the main clinical diagnosis suspicion."

    "title": "Effects of cycling training on balance and gait in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A randomized controlled study.",
    "abstract": "Although aerobic exercises such as cycling and swimming are increasingly being recommended in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), their effect on gait and balance parameters is unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of cycling training on balance and spatio-temporal gait parameters in children with DMD. Ambulant children (age range: 6.17-11.33 years) were randomly divided into two groups: home-based exercise training applied in the control group (n = 12) while 12 weeks of supervised submaximal lower extremity cycling training in addition to home-based exercise training performed in the study group (n = 11). Gait and balance parameters were evaluated using the GAITRite electronic walkway system and the Bertec Balance Check Screener™, respectively. Assessments were applied before and after 12 weeks of training. The mean ages of the children in the study and control groups were 8.20 (SD:1.34) and 8.86 (SD:1.30) years, consecutively (p > 0.05). Considering the baseline values, the balance and spatio-temporal gait parameters of the children were similar except for the antero-posterior postural sway on the perturbed surface with eyes open (p > 0.05). There was a significant time x group interaction effect in favor of the study group for the antero-posterior postural sway of children on the normal surface with eyes open (F (1,58) = 12.62, p = 0.002). It was found that the antero-posterior postural sway on the normal surface with eyes open was improved in the study group within group comparison (F (1,10) = 8.50, p = 0.015). The study showed that both the cycling and the home-based exercise training groups may maintain gait and balance parameters during the study. Adding a cycling training to the rehabilitation program can also provide additional contribution to improve antero-posterior balance."

    "abstract": "To examine factors associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This cross-sectional study included 45 individuals diagnosed with DMD between the ages of 5 and 18 years. LUTS were evaluated with the Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Scoring System, functional levels with the Brooke Upper Extremity Functional Classification and the Vignos Scale, lumbar lordosis angle with a bubble inclinometer, pelvic inclination angles with a digital inclinometer, and muscle strength with a hand-held dynamometer. The mean age of the children was calculated as 9.00 ± 3.32 years, body weight as 31.10 ± 12.59 kg, and height as 125.87 ± 18.46 cm. LUTD was detected in 20 children (44.44%). There was an association between high LUTD severity and low strength of the following muscles: bilateral hip flexor (Dominant: r = -0.338, p = 0.023; nondominant: r = -0.411, p = 0.005), quadriceps femoris (Dominant: r = -0.445, p = 0.002; nondominant: r = -0.504, p < 0.001), elbow flexor (Dominant: r = -0.461, p = 0.001; nondominant: r = -0.455, p = 0.002), and elbow extensor (Dominant: r = -0.442, p = 0.002; nondominant: r = -0.450, p = 0.002). Upper extremity functionality level was significantly higher in the LUTD-negative group (p = 0.004). There was no relationship between lumbar lordosis and pelvic inclination angles and LUTS symptoms (p > 0.05). To provide the adequate care for bladder health in children with DMD, it is essential to focus on parameters that will increase functionality and independence in this population."

    "abstract": "Serum biomarkers are promising minimally invasive outcome measures in clinical studies in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, biomarkers strongly associated with clinical progression and predicting performance decline are lacking. In this study we aimed to identify serum biomarkers associated with clinical performance and able to predict clinical milestones in DMD. Towards this aim we present a retrospective multi-center cohort study including serum samples and clinical data collected in research participants with DMD as part of a natural history study at the University of Florida (UF) and real-world observations at Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) between 2009-2022. The 7K SomaScan<sup>®</sup> assay was used to analyse protein levels in in individual serum samples. Serum biomarkers predicted age at loss of ambulation (LoA), age at loss of overhead reach (OHR) and age at loss of hand to mouth function (HTM). Secondary outcomes were the association of biomarkers with age, corticosteroid (CS) usage, and clinical performance based on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), 10 meter run velocity (10mrv), 6 minute walk (6MWT) and Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL2.0). A total of 716 serum samples were collected in 79 participants at UF and 74 at LUMC (mean[SD] age; 10.9[3.2] vs 8.4[3.4]). 244 serum proteins showed an association with CS usage in both cohorts independent of CS type and regimen, including MMP3 and IGLL1. 318 probes (corresponding to 294 proteins) showed significant associations with NSAA, 10mrv, 6MWT and/or PUL2.0 across both cohorts. The expression of 38 probes corresponding to 36 proteins such as RGMA, EHMT2, ART3, ANTXR2 and DLK1 was associated with risk of both lower and upper limb clinical milestones in both the LUMC and UF cohort. In conclusion, multiple biomarkers were associated with CS use, motor function and upper lower and upper limb disease milestones in DMD. These biomarkers were validated across two independent cohorts, increasing their likelihood of translation for use within the broader DMD population."

    "abstract": "As the evolutionary ancestor of Cas9 nuclease, IscB proteins serve as compact RNA-guided DNA endonucleases and nickases, making them strong candidates for base editing. Nevertheless, the narrow targeting scope limits the application of IscB systems; thus, it is necessary to find more IscBs that recognize different target-adjacent motifs (TAMs). Here, we identified 10 of 19 uncharacterized IscB proteins from uncultured microbes with activity in mammalian cells. Through protein and ωRNA engineering, we further enhanced the activity of IscB ortholog IscB.m16 and expanded its TAM scope from MRNRAA to NNNGNA, resulting in a variant named IscB.m16*. By fusing the deaminase domains with IscB.m16* nickase, we generated IscB.m16*-derived base editors that exhibited robust base-editing efficiency in mammalian cells and effectively restored Duchenne muscular dystrophy proteins in diseased mice through single adeno-associated virus delivery. Thus, this study establishes a set of compact base-editing tools for basic research and therapeutic applications."

It was aimed to examine the effects of foot posture and anthropometric characteristics, which deteriorated from the early period, on ambulation and performance of patients with DMD. The foot arch height (FAH), the metatarsal width (MW), subtalar pronation angle, and ankle limitation degree (ALD) were evaluated to determine the foot anthropometric characteristics of the patients. Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) was used to evaluate foot posture. The performance of the patients was determined by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), and ascend/descend a standard 4-step test, and the ambulation was determined by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA). Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between foot anthropometric characteristics and posture, and performance and ambulation. The sample consisted of 48 patients with DMD aged 5.5 to 12 years. Both of the right and left foot FPI-6 scores were associated with all parameters, except descending 4-step. The left FAH was associated with 6MWT and NSAA, and the left MW was associated with 6MWT. The ALD of right foot was associated with 6MWT, ascending/descending 4 steps, and NSAA, and left ankle limitation was associated with NSAA (p<0.05). There was no relationship between other parameters. These findings suggest that postural disorders in the foot and ankle may contribute to the decrease in performance and ambulation in patients with DMD."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to compare shear modulus of lower limb muscles between children with hypotonia versus typical development (TD) or developmental disorders associated with altered tone. Nineteen children with mild hypotonia (mean age 9.4 ± 2.3y, 13 male) completed assessment of resting shear modulus of rectus femoris, biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) at short and long lengths using shear wave elastography. Data was compared with previous data from TD children and a scoping review for children with developmental disorders. Data were collated according to Net-Longitudinal Tension Angle (Net-LTA), which is the muscle length expressed as the net proximal and distal joint angles. Effects of Net-LTA (e.g., short, neutral, long) were examined according to sex, age and body mass index (BMI). In children with hypotonia, shear modulus was: higher at longer versus shorter lengths for four muscles (p < 0.01); correlated with age for BF-short (r = 0.60, p < 0.03) and GL-short (r = -0.54, p < 0.03), with BMI for BF-short (r = 0.71, p < 0.05); and not different between sexes (p > 0.05). The shear modulus values for lower limb muscles for children with mild hypotonia were lower than those for children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (TA-neutral), or Cerebral Palsy (GL-neutral), but not TD children (all four muscles). In conclusion, shear modulus increases with longer muscle length (i.e. higher Net-LTA) in mildly hypotonic children. Children with mild hypotonia have lower shear modulus than children with cerebral palsy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 232 participants with SBMA. Participants provided input regarding 18 themes and 208 symptoms that affect patients with SBMA. Participants were asked about the relative importance of each symptom, and analysis was conducted to determine how age, education, disease duration, CAG repeat length, and ambulation status relate to symptom prevalence. Hip, thigh, or knee weakness (96.5%), fatigue (96.5%), problems with hands and fingers (95.7%), and limitations with walking (95.7%) were the themes with the highest prevalence in the study population. Ambulatory status was associated with the prevalence of 9 of the 14 themes, and CAG repeat length and education were each associated with 4 of 14 themes. The prevalence of fatigue was reduced in those with a lower CAG repeat length and increased with a longer disease duration. Younger patients reported a higher prevalence of emotional issues. There are a diversity of themes that are important to patients with SBMA. These themes have a variable level of importance to the population with SBMA and represent clinically meaningful outcome measures for future therapeutic interventions."

    "abstract": "Rare disorders comprise of ~ 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India. Overall, 3294 patients with 305 rare diseases were identified in the present study cohort. These were categorized into 14 disease groups based on the major organ/ organ system affected. Highest number of rare diseases (D = 149/305, 48.9%) were identified in the neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental (NMND) group followed by inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (D = 47/305; 15.4%). Majority patients in the present cohort (N = 1992, 61%) were diagnosed under IEM group, of which Gaucher disease constituted maximum cases (N = 224, 11.2%). Under the NMND group, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (N = 291/885, 32.9%), trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders (N = 242/885; 27.3%) and spinal muscular atrophy (N = 141/885, 15.9%) were the most common. Majority cases of β-thalassemia (N = 120/149, 80.5%) and cystic fibrosis (N = 74/75, 98.7%) under the haematological and pulmonary groups were observed, respectively. Founder variants were identified for Tay-Sachs disease and mucopolysaccharidosis IVA diseases. Recurrent variants for Gaucher disease (GBA:c.1448T > C), β-thalassemia (HBB:c.92.+5G > C), non-syndromic hearing loss (GJB2:c.71G > A), albinism (TYR:c.832 C > T), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CYP21A2:c.29-13 C > G) and progressive pseudo rheumatoid dysplasia (CCN6:c.298T > A) were observed in the present study. The present retrospective study of rare disease patients diagnosed at a tertiary genetic test centre provides first insight into the distribution of rare genetic diseases across the country. This information will likely aid in drafting future health policies, including newborn screening programs, development of target specific panel for affordable diagnosis of rare diseases and eventually build a platform for devising novel treatment strategies for rare diseases."

    "abstract": "Replicative senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) caused by repeated cell culture undermines their potential as a cell therapy because of the reduction in their proliferation and therapeutic potential. Glutaminase-1 (GLS1) is reported to be involved in the survival of senescent cells, and inhibition of GLS1 alleviates age-related dysfunction via senescent cell removal. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the association between MSC senescence and GLS1. We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to analyze the effect of GLS1 inhibition on senolysis and the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Inhibition of GLS1 in Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) reduced the expression of aging-related markers, such as p16, p21, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype genes, by senolysis. Replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs, which recovered after short-term treatment with bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES), showed increased proliferation and therapeutic effects compared to those observed with senescent WJ-MSCs. Moreover, compared to senescent WJ-MSCs, replicative senescence-alleviated WJ-MSCs inhibited apoptosis in serum-starved C2C12 cells, enhanced muscle formation, and hindered apoptosis and fibrosis in mdx mice. These results imply that GLS1 inhibition can ameliorate the therapeutic effects of senescent WJ-MSCs in patients with muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, GLS1 is a key factor in modulating the senescence mechanism of MSCs, and regulation of GLS1 may enhance the therapeutic effects of senescent MSCs, thereby increasing the success rate of clinical trials involving MSCs."

This study was conducted to analyze the role of Sesn2 in the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and related aspects in mdx mice, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Our results showed that knockdown of Sesn2 reduced the myogenic differentiation capacity of C2C12 myoblasts. Predictive analysis from two databases suggested that miR-182-5p is a potential regulator of Sesn2. Further experimental validation revealed that overexpression of miR-182-5p decreased both the protein and mRNA levels of Sesn2 and inhibited myogenesis of C2C12 myoblasts. These findings suggest that miR-182-5p negatively regulates myogenesis by repressing Sesn2 expression. Extending to an in vivo model of DMD, knockdown of Sesn2 led to decreased Myogenin (Myog) expression and increased Pax7 expression, while its overexpression upregulated Myog levels and enhanced the proportion of slow-switch myofibers. These findings indicate the crucial role of Sesn2 in promoting myogenic differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration, providing potential therapeutic targets for muscular dystrophy."

Plexiform neurofibromas, one of many NF1 manifestations, are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors occurring in up to 50% of NF1 patients. A substantial fraction of NF1 pathogenetic variants are nonsense mutations, which result in the synthesis of truncated non-functional NF1 protein (neurofibromin). To date, no therapeutics have restored neurofibromin expression or addressed the consequences of this protein's absence in NF1 nonsense mutation patients, but nonsense suppression is a potential approach to the problem. Ataluren is a small molecule drug that has been shown to stimulate functional nonsense codon readthrough in several models of nonsense mutation diseases, as well as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. To test ataluren's potential applicability in nonsense mutation NF1 patients, we evaluated its therapeutic effects using three treatment regimens in a previously established NF1 patient-derived (c.2041C > T; p.Arg681X) nonsense mutation mouse model. Collectively, our experiments indicate that: i) ataluren appeared to slow the growth of neurofibromas and alleviate some paralysis phenotypes, ii) female Nf1-nonsense mutation mice manifested more severe paralysis and neurofibroma phenotypes than male mice, iii) ataluren doses with apparent effectiveness were lower in female mice than in male mice, and iv) age factors also influenced ataluren's effectiveness."

We analyze the evidence supporting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of gene and RNA therapies for rare inherited diseases and discuss implications for clinical practice and policy. We conducted a qualitative analysis of FDA documents outlining the basis of approval for gene and RNA therapies approved for rare inherited diseases between 2016 and 2023. For each drug, we gathered five characteristics of the evidence supporting FDA approval (no phase 3 trial, nonrandomized, no clinical endpoint, lack of demonstrated benefit, and significant protocol deviation) and four characteristics of the FDA approval process (prior rejection or complete response, negative committee vote, discrepancy between label and trial population, and boxed warning). The main outcome was the number of drugs with each characteristic. Between 2016 and 2023, 19 gene and RNA therapies received FDA approval to treat rare inherited diseases. The most common limitations in the evidence supporting approval of these drugs were nonrandomized studies (8/19, 42%), no clinical endpoint (7/19, 37%), lack of demonstrated benefit or inconsistent results (4/19, 21%), and no phase 3 trial (4/19, 21%). Half (3/6) of accelerated approvals and 57% (5/9) of drugs with breakthrough designation had nonrandomized trials, and gene therapies with one-time dosing were overrepresented (5/7, 71%) among the drugs with nonrandomized trials. Five of six accelerated approvals (83%) and five of nine pediatric drugs (56%), most of which were indicated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, had no clinical endpoint. Four of nine (44%) pediatric drugs and four of six (67%) accelerated approvals failed to demonstrate benefit compared with none of the nonpediatric drugs and none of the traditional approvals. Five drugs, which all had different indications and represented a mix of RNA and gene therapies, did not have any of these evidence characteristics. Among drugs that received prior rejections or negative committee opinions, all four had nonrandomized trials and lacked a clinical endpoint, and 75% (3/4) lacked demonstrated benefit. Five of nine (56%) pediatric drugs were indicated for broader age groups according to the drug label compared with the trial populations. Of the three drugs with boxed warnings, two had pediatric indications and nonrandomized studies, and one had no phase 3 trial. Issues related to trial design, outcome, and data integrity in the evidence supporting FDA approval of rare inherited disease gene and RNA therapies raise questions about whether this evidence is adequate to inform prescribing decisions. Gene and RNA therapies with accelerated approval and pediatric indications were overrepresented among drugs lacking clinical endpoints or demonstrated benefit and should be the focus of efforts to reduce uncertainty in the evidence."

To determine the frequency of adrenal suppression (AS) induced by vamorolone and prednisone in pediatric DMD and to assess cortisol thresholds using a monoclonal antibody immunoassay. Post hoc analysis of cortisol levels was performed on data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and prednisone-controlled 24-week trial of vamorolone with a 24-week crossover extension. Morning and ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels were measured using the Elecsys II immunoassay, with AS defined as a stimulated cortisol of <500 nmol/L (\"historical threshold\") and <400 nmol/L (\"revised threshold\"). Mean age at enrolment was 5.41 ± 0.86 years (n = 118). At week 24, the proportion of participants with AS using the historical and revised cortisol thresholds, respectively, were as follows: prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day = 100% (25/25) and 92.0% (23/25); vamorolone 6 mg/kg/day = 95.2% (20/21) and 90.5% (19/21); vamorolone 2 mg/kg/day = 84.2% (16/19) and 47.5% (9/19); and placebo = 20.0% (4/20) and 0% (0/20). Morning and peak ACTH-stimulated cortisol were strongly correlated in steroid-treated boys (Spearman correlation week 48 = 0.83). AS after vamorolone and prednisone was frequent and vamorolone-associated AS appeared dose-dependent. A lower stimulated cortisol threshold may be appropriate when using a monoclonal assay. We recommend hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid stress dosing in patients receiving vamorolone."

This article provides an overview on therapeutic advances for SMA and DMD in the last 10 years, with a focus on the effects of disease-modifying therapies on respiratory function."

    "title": "Discriminatory Properties of the Quality-Adjusted Life Year Based Cost-Effectiveness Analyses for Patients With Disabilities: A Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Case Study.",
    "abstract": "Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) have been challenged as a measure of benefit for people with disabilities, particularly for those in low-utility health states or with irreversible disability. This study examined the impact of a QALY-based assessment on the price for a hypothetical treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive, genetic neuromuscular disease. A previously published, 5-state model, which analyzed treatments for early ambulatory (EA) DMD patients, was replicated, validated, and adapted to include early nonambulatory (ENA) DMD patients. The model was used to assess a QALY-based threshold price (maximum cost-effective price) for a hypothetical treatment for 13-year-old ENA and 5-year-old EA patients (initial health states with lower and higher utility, respectively). All inputs were replicated including willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000/QALY. In contrast to EA patients, ENA patients had a 98% modeled decline in QALY-based threshold price at a willingness-to-pay of $150 000/QALY or higher, despite equal treatment benefit (delayed progression/death). At $100 000/QALY or lower, net nontreatment costs exceeded health benefits, implying any treatment for ENA patients would not be considered cost-effective, even at $0 price, including an indefinite pause in disease progression. For certain severe, disabling conditions, traditional approaches are likely to conclude that treatments are not cost-effective at any price once a patient progresses to a disabled health state with low utility value. These findings elucidate theoretical/ethical concerns regarding potential discriminatory properties of traditional QALY assessments for people with disabilities, particularly those who have lost ambulation or have other physical limitations."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive, life-limiting, neuromuscular disorder. Clinicians play an important role in informing families about therapy options, including approved gene therapies and clinical trials of unapproved therapies. This study aimed to understand the perspectives of clinicians about gene therapy for DMD, which has not previously been studied. We conducted interviews with specialist clinicians treating patients with DMD in the United States (n = 8) and United Kingdom (n = 8). Interviews were completed in 2022, before any approved gene therapies, to gain insight into barriers and facilitators to implementing gene therapy and educational needs of clinicians. Most respondents expressed cautious optimism about gene therapy. Responses varied regarding potential benefits with most expecting delayed progression and duration of benefit (1 year to lifelong). Concern about anticipated risks also varied; types of anticipated risks included immunological reactions, liver toxicity, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. Clinicians generally, but not uniformly, understood that gene therapy for DMD would not be curative. Most reported needing demonstrable clinical benefit to justify treatment-related risks. Our data demonstrate variability in knowledge and attitudes about gene therapy among clinicians who follow patients with DMD. As our knowledge base about DMD gene therapy grows, clinician education is vital to ensuring that accurate information is communicated to patients and families."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders are a group of rare heterogenous diseases with profound impact on quality of life, for which overall pediatric prevalence has rarely been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the point prevalence of pediatric neuromuscular disorders and its subcategories in the central region of Portugal. Retrospective case identification was carried out in children with neuromuscular disorders seen between 1998 and 2020 from multiple data sources. Demographics, clinical and molecular diagnoses were registered. On January 1, 2020, the point overall prevalence in the population <18 years of age was 41.20/100 000 (95% confidence interval 34.51-49.19) for all neuromuscular disorders. The main case proportion were genetic disorders (95.7%). We found a relatively higher occurrence of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, and spinal muscular atrophy and a slightly lower occurrence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, and acquired neuropathies compared to previous studies in other countries. Molecular confirmation was available in 69.5% of pediatric neuromuscular patients in our cohort.Total prevalence is high in comparison with the data reported in the only previous study on the prevalence of pediatric neuromuscular disorders in our country. Our high definitive diagnostic rate underscores the importance of advances in investigative genetic techniques, particularly new sequencing technologies, in the diagnostic workup of neuromuscular patients."

    "abstract": "Common to all inflammatory arthritides, namely rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, is a potential for reduced mobility that manifests through joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and ultimately joint damage. Across these conditions, consensus has been reached on the need to capture outcomes related to mobility, such as functional capacity and physical activity, as core domains in randomised controlled trials. Existing endpoints within these core domains rely wholly on self-reported questionnaires that capture patients' perceptions of their symptoms and activities. These questionnaires are subjective, inherently vulnerable to recall bias, and do not capture the granularity of fluctuations over time. Several early adopters have integrated sensor-based digital health technology (DHT)-derived endpoints to measure physical function and activity in randomised controlled trials for conditions including Parkinson's disease, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. Despite these applications, there have been no sensor-based DHT-derived endpoints in clinical trials recruiting patients with inflammatory arthritis. Borrowing from case studies across medicine, we outline the opportunities and challenges in developing novel sensor-based DHT-derived endpoints that capture the symptoms and disease manifestations most relevant to patients with inflammatory arthritis."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive neuromuscular disorder with a distinct cognitive profile including decreased verbal span. Children with DMD are also at risk for lower scores on academic achievement tests and increased behavioral problems. Longitudinal analyses generally reveal a stable intellectual profile, although attention and behavioral problems may negatively impact longitudinal IQ scores. To date, no study has reported on reading over time in DMD. Reading performance was assessed longitudinally in children with DMD, examining for potential contributions to the trajectory. Retrospective data analysis on assessments completed at baseline, year 2, and year 4 on 26 boys with DMD and 27 unaffected sibling controls (age at baseline: DMD 8 ± 1.4, controls 9 ± 2.6) indicated that children with DMD performed slightly, yet significantly, worse than controls on reading skills, but the longitudinal trajectory of reading skills for children with DMD and controls was not significantly different. Verbal span at time 1 was uniquely associated with later reading skills in children with DMD. Behavior was not associated with declines. The results confirm that children with DMD underperform on reading tasks and align with previous research suggesting that cognitive skills in DMD are stable over time."

DMD is a rare, severe neuromuscular disease that causes death due to cardiovascular and respiratory complications among affected boys. Since the 1980s, ongoing preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted to explore the disease in depth and discover potential therapeutic strategies. In Saudi Arabia, it is unclear whether health services and research efforts are keeping pace with global achievements. Therefore, this review aims to explore the diagnostic and management strategies and research efforts in Saudi Arabia over the past three decades. I searched the PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and included all published articles on the epidemiology, genetics, diagnosis, and management of DMD/BMD in this review. The findings suggest a lack of local standardized diagnostic strategies, a poor understanding of epidemiology and common pathogenic variants, and a critical need for preclinical and clinical research. At the time of writing, no such comprehensive review has been published. Challenges, limitations, and future perspectives are also discussed in this article."

They may all be interested by a progressive and sometimes irreversible pump respiratory failure which unfortunately for some NMD may start soon after the diagnosis. Within this vast group of patients those affected by muscle diseases are a subgroup who comprises patients with an average earlier onset of symptoms compared to other NMD. Indeed it is also important to comprehend not just the patient's burden but also the surrounding families'. Defining the end of life (EoL) phase in these patients is not simple especially in the young patient population. Consequently, the late stage of disease remains poorly defined and challenging. The aim of this review is to describe the EoL phase in NMD patients with attention to QoL and psycological status. The focus would be on one hand on the management of the psychological burden, the communication barriers, and tone of humor. Those topics have been described being crucial in this group of patients as they increase tensions and burden of both patient and family, and between them and the outside world. Thus also causing their social isolation, increasing anxiety and reducing their quality of life. On the other hand the use of cough clearance devices and all the respiratory supports and their withdrawn are carefully evaluated in the view of alleviating respiratory symptoms, improving patient quality of life and above all reaching the patient's goals of care. Although there is no cure, the advent of supportive interventions including multidisciplinary care (MDC) has improved all the aspects of dying for patients affected by NMD; nevertheless there still a long pathway ahead."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder primarily affecting males, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The absence of dystrophin protein leads to progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Recent advances in the therapeutic landscape underscore the need to identify appropriate outcome measures to assess treatment efficacy in ambulant and non-ambulant DMD patients, across clinical and research settings. This is essential for accurately evaluating new treatments and attributing therapeutic benefits.It is crucial to establish a robust correlation between outcome scores and disease progression patterns. This task is challenging since functional test performance may be influenced by different patient's characteristics, including the physiological evolution of the neurodevelopment together with the disease progression. While widely used DMD outcomes such as the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, the 6-Minute Walking Test, the 4 stairs climbed, and the Performance of the Upper Limb exhibit reliability and validity, their clinical significance is influenced by the wide phenotype and progression variability of the disease.We present and discuss the features (relevance, quantifiability, validity, objectivity, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, precision) of available DMD outcome measures, including new potential measures that may be provided by digital tools and artificial intelligence."

The ability to assess patient-level DMD disease progression within insurance claims or EHR data infrastructures is unknown. Insurance claims and EHR data were comprehensively examined for availability and reliability of DMD outcomes that describe functional status and disease progression at the individual patient level over time. MarketScan Commercial and Medicaid claims, and EHR-linked Clarivate open claims datasets were examined for data measuring 54 previously identified DMD-relevant outcomes in patients with DMD. Each outcome was assigned to one of five categories: functional and clinical events, clinical measures, biomarkers, functional measures, or patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Patients were identified using published coding algorithms. Annual 5-year attrition and data availability for each outcome was determined. The ability to distinguish disease severity and identify test results was also considered where applicable. A total of 1964 (MarketScan Commercial), 2007 (MarketScan Medicaid), and 10,639 (Clarivate) patients were identified. At 5 years, 31.7%, 35.1%, and 59.1% of patients remained in MarketScan Commercial, MarketScan Medicaid, and Clarivate, respectively. Claims were available for five of six functional and clinical events, with 45.5% (MarketScan Commercial), 48.0% (Clarivate), and 48.5% (MarketScan Medicaid) of patients with ≥ 1 claim for the most frequently identified clinical event (cardiomyopathy diagnosis). No data were available to describe frequency of wheelchair use or loss of ambulation. Very limited EHR data (≤ 2% of patients) were available to indicate tests were ordered for clinical measures, biomarkers, or functional assessments. No PRO notes or scores were observed. Data existed for inferring disease severity (e.g., hospitalization for cardiomyopathy); however, it was not apparent whether these events were incident. Insurance claims and EHR-linked open claims data are of limited utility for holistically evaluating the progression and burden of DMD in individual patients."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases of genetic origin characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration and weakness. There are several types of MDs, varying in terms of age of onset, severity, and pattern of the affected muscles. However, all of them worsen over time, and many patients will eventually lose their ability to walk. In addition to skeletal muscle effects, patients with MDs may present cardiac and respiratory disorders, generating complications that could lead to death. Interdisciplinary management is required to improve the surveillance and quality of life of patients with an MD. At present, pharmacological therapy is only available for Duchene muscular dystrophy (DMD)-the most common type of MD-and is mainly based on the use of corticosteroids. Other MDs caused by alterations in dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) are less frequent but represent an important group within these diseases. Pharmacological alternatives with clinical potential in patients with MDs and other proteins associated with dystrophin have been scarcely explored. This review focuses on drugs and molecules that have shown beneficial effects, mainly in experimental models involving alterations in DAPs. The mechanisms associated with the effects leading to promising results regarding the recovery or maintenance of muscle strength and reduction in fibrosis in the less-common MDs (i.e., with respect to DMD) are explored, and other therapeutic targets that could contribute to maintaining the homeostasis of muscle fibers, involving different pathways, such as calcium regulation, hypertrophy, and maintenance of satellite cell function, are also examined. It is possible that some of the drugs explored here could be used to affordably improve the muscular function of patients until a definitive treatment for MDs is developed."

This systematic review primarily aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the current understanding regarding the application of VR in supporting MD rehabilitation. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies involving individuals diagnosed with MD who underwent VR interventions, with a primary focus on assessing functional improvement. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed by using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Seven studies, involving 440 individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), were included in the review. Among these studies, six primarily explored the motor learning potential of VR, while one study investigated the impact of VR training on functional abilities. In conclusion, the qualitative synthesis supports VR-based interventions' potential positive effects on motor learning, performance improvement, and functional outcomes in individuals with DMD. However, current usage mainly focuses on assessing the potential mechanisms' benefits, suggesting the importance of expanding clinical adoption to harness their therapeutic potential for MD patients."

Here, we investigated a female patient presenting with muscular dystrophy who remained genetically undiagnosed after MLPA and exome sequencing. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) from the patient's muscle biopsy identified an 85% reduction in <i>DMD</i> expression compared to 116 muscle samples included in the cohort. A de novo balanced translocation between chromosome 17 and the X chromosome (t(X;17)(p21.1;q23.2)) disrupting the <i>DMD</i> and <i>BCAS3</i> genes was identified through trio whole genome sequencing (WGS). The combined analysis of RNAseq and WGS played a crucial role in the detection and characterisation of the disease-causing variant in this patient, who had been undiagnosed for over two decades.

Studies including typically developing children were used to contrast and enhance findings. Thirty-two studies were included, with 10,129 unique individuals represented: seventeen studies focused on healthy/typically developing children; seven on children with cerebral palsy; three on children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy; two on children with sarcopenia; and one study each on children with osteoporosis, congenital muscular dystrophy, and other various neurologic disorders. Thirteen studies assessed functional outcomes, ten assessed bone outcomes, and nine assessed other cardiovascular/metabolic outcomes. All of the included studies demonstrated relationships between muscle mass and respective outcomes in varying measures.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by genetic mutations in the cytoskeletal-sarcolemmal anchor protein dystrophin. Repeated cycles of sarcolemmal tearing and repair lead to a variety of secondary cellular and physiological stressors that are thought to contribute to weakness, atrophy, and fibrosis. Collectively, these stressors can contribute to a pro-inflammatory milieu in locomotor, cardiac, and respiratory muscles. Given the many unwanted side effects that accompany current anti-inflammatory steroid-based approaches for treating DMD (e.g., glucocorticoids), there is a need to develop new therapies that address inflammation and other cellular dysfunctions. Adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) agonists, which stimulate AdipoR1 and R2 isoforms on various cell types, have emerged as therapeutic candidates for DMD due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and pro-myogenic properties in pre-clinical human and rodent DMD models. Although these molecules represent a new direction for therapeutic intervention, the mechanisms through which they elicit their beneficial effects are not yet fully understood, and DMD-specific data is limited. The overarching goal of this review is to investigate how adiponectin signaling may ameliorate pathology associated with dystrophin deficiency through inflammatory-dependent and -independent mechanisms and to determine if current data supports their future progression to clinical trials."

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its related Cas proteins offer a modern form of curative gene therapy for treating the rare diseases. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, hereditary angioedema, duchenne muscular dystrophy and Rett syndrome are a few examples of such rare diseases. CRISPR/Cas9, for example, has been used in the treatment of β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (Frangoul et al., 2021; Pavani et al., 2021) [1,2]. Neurological diseases such as Huntington's have also been focused in some studies involving CRISPR/Cas (Yang et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2023) [3,4]. Delivery of these biologicals via vector and non vector mediated methods depends on the type of target cells, characteristics of expression, time duration of expression, size of foreign genetic material etc. For instance, retroviruses find their applicability in case of ex vivo delivery in somatic cells due to their ability to integrate in the host genome. These have been successfully used in gene therapy involving X-SCID patients although, incidence of inappropriate activation has been reported. On the other hand, ex vivo gene therapy for β-thalassemia involved use of BB305 lentiviral vector for high level expression of CRISPR biological in HSCs. The efficacy and safety of these biologicals will decide their future application as efficient genome editing tools as they go forward in further stages of human clinical trials.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease caused by mutations to the dystrophin gene, resulting in deficiency of dystrophin protein, loss of myofiber integrity in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and eventual cell death and replacement with fibrotic tissue. Pathologic cardiac manifestations occur in nearly every DMD patient, with the development of cardiomyopathy-the leading cause of death-inevitable by adulthood. As early cardiac abnormalities are difficult to detect, timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment modalities remain a challenge. There is no cure for DMD; treatment is aimed at delaying disease progression and alleviating symptoms. A comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms is crucial to the development of targeted treatments. While established hypotheses of underlying mechanisms include sarcolemmal weakening, upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and perturbed ion homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a potential key contributor. Several experimental compounds targeting the skeletal muscle pathology of DMD are in development, but the effects of such agents on cardiac function remain unclear. The synergistic integration of small molecule- and gene-target-based drugs with metabolic-, immune-, or ion balance-enhancing compounds into a combinatorial therapy offers potential for treating dystrophin deficiency-induced cardiomyopathy, making it crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms driving the disorder."

New techniques such as shearwave elastography and artificial intelligence algorithms for automated image segmentation show promise but need further development for use in everyday practice.Muscle ultrasound has high correlations with clinical measures of function in skeletal and respiratory muscles and the orofacial region, in most of the myopathies and dystrophies studied. Over time, imaging changes precede changes in clinical status, making them attractive for biomarker use in trials. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy MUS was also responsive to the effects of steroid treatment. Muscle ultrasound is a sensitive technique to diagnose and follow up of skeletal, facial and respiratory muscles in neuromuscular disorders. Its role is both complementary to and partially overlapping with that of MRI."

This review article thoroughly assesses primary and secondary DMD therapies, focusing on innovative modalities. The primary therapy addresses the genetic abnormality causing DMD, specifically the absence or reduced expression of dystrophin. Gene replacement therapies, such as exon skipping, readthrough, and gene editing technologies, show promise in restoring dystrophin expression. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), a recent advancement in viral vector-based gene therapies, have shown encouraging results in preclinical and clinical studies. Secondary therapies aim to maintain muscle function and improve quality of life by mitigating DMD symptoms and complications. Glucocorticoid drugs like prednisone and deflazacort have proven effective in slowing disease progression and delaying loss of ambulation. Supportive treatments targeting calcium dysregulation, histone deacetylase, and redox imbalance are also crucial for preserving overall health and function. Additionally, the review includes a detailed table of ongoing and approved clinical trials for DMD, exploring various therapeutic approaches such as gene therapies, exon skipping drugs, utrophin modulators, anti-inflammatory agents, and novel compounds.

Several ASO drugs have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for DMD and global efforts are still ongoing to improve further their potency, notably by developing new delivery systems or alternative chemistries. In this context, a recent study investigated the potential of different chemically modified ASO to induce exon-skipping in mouse models of DMD. Importantly, the authors reported a strong discrepancy between exon-skipping and protein restoration levels, which was mainly owing to the high affinity of locked nucleic acid (LNA) modifications to the target RNA, thereby interfering with the amplification of the unskipped product and resulting in artificial overamplification of the exon-skipped product. These findings urged us to verify whether a similar phenomenon could occur with tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA)-ASO that also display high-affinity properties to the target RNA. We thus ran a series of control experiments and demonstrate here that exon-skipping levels are not overestimated owing to an interference of tcDNA-ASO with the unskipped product in contrast to what was observed with LNA-containing ASO."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease produced by mutations in the dystrophin gene characterized by early onset muscle weakness leading to severe and irreversible disability. Muscle degeneration involves a complex interplay between multiple cell lineages spatially located within areas of damage, termed the degenerative niche, including inflammatory cells, satellite cells (SCs) and fibro-adipogenic precursor cells (FAPs). FAPs are mesenchymal stem cell which have a pivotal role in muscle homeostasis as they can either promote muscle regeneration or contribute to muscle degeneration by expanding fibrotic and fatty tissue. Although it has been described that FAPs could have a different behavior in DMD patients than in healthy controls, the molecular pathways regulating their function as well as their gene expression profile are unknown. <b>Methods:</b> We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) with 10X Genomics and Illumina technology to elucidate the differences in the transcriptional profile of isolated FAPs from healthy and DMD patients. <b>Results:</b> Gene signatures in FAPs from both groups revealed transcriptional differences. Seurat analysis categorized cell clusters as proliferative FAPs, regulatory FAPs, inflammatory FAPs, and myofibroblasts. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy and DMD FAPs included upregulated genes CHI3L1, EFEMP1, MFAP5, and TGFBR2 in DMD. Functional analysis highlighted distinctions in system development, wound healing, and cytoskeletal organization in control FAPs, while extracellular organization, degradation, and collagen degradation were upregulated in DMD FAPs. Validation of DEGs in additional samples (<i>n</i> = 9) using qPCR reinforced the specific impact of pathological settings on FAP heterogeneity, reflecting their distinct contribution to fibro or fatty degeneration <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> Using the single-cell RNA seq from human samples provide new opportunities to study cellular coordination to further understand the regulation of muscle homeostasis and degeneration that occurs in muscular dystrophies."

We present a case of a 16-year-old boy admitted with heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF). He was diagnosed with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and gene testing showed comorbid mutations in gene DMD, ABCB4 and DSC2. Amiodarone was prescribed to control the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation intravenously. However, his liver enzyme levels were sharply elevated, along with cardiac shock, renal failure and coagulation disorders. After bedside continuous renal replacement therapy, the patient's liver function and clinical status rehabilitated. ABCB4 gene mutation might be involved in amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity.

    "abstract": "Mutations in the <i>DMD</i> gene lead to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe neuromuscular disorder affecting young boys as they acquire motor functions. DMD is typically diagnosed at 2-4 years of age, but the absence of dystrophin has negative impacts on skeletal muscles before overt symptoms appear in patients, which poses a serious challenge in current standards of care. Here, we investigated the consequences of dystrophin deficiency during skeletal muscle development. We used single-cell transcriptome profiling to characterize the myogenic trajectory of human pluripotent stem cells and showed that DMD cells bifurcate to an alternative branch when they reach the somite stage. Dystrophin deficiency was linked to marked dysregulations of cell junction proteins involved in the cell state transitions characteristic of embryonic somitogenesis. Altogether, this work demonstrates that <i>in vitro</i>, dystrophin deficiency has deleterious effects on cell-cell communication during myogenic development, which should be considered in future therapeutic strategies for DMD."

    "abstract": "Exosomes are promising therapeutics for tissue repair and regeneration to induce and guide appropriate immune responses in dystrophic pathologies. However, manipulating exosomes to control their biodistribution and targeting them in vivo to achieve adequate therapeutic benefits still poses a major challenge. Here we overcome this limitation by developing an externally controlled delivery system for primed annexin A1 myo-exosomes (Exo<sup>myo</sup>). Effective nanocarriers are realized by immobilizing the Exo<sup>myo</sup> onto ferromagnetic nanotubes to achieve controlled delivery and localization of Exo<sup>myo</sup> to skeletal muscles by systemic injection using an external magnetic field. Quantitative muscle-level analyses revealed that macrophages dominate the uptake of Exo<sup>myo</sup> from these ferromagnetic nanotubes in vivo to synergistically promote beneficial muscle responses in a murine animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our findings provide insights into the development of exosome-based therapies for muscle diseases and, in general, highlight the formulation of effective functional nanocarriers aimed at optimizing exosome biodistribution."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic neuromuscular disease. Although it leads to muscle weakness, affected individuals predominantly die from cardiomyopathy, which remains uncurable. Accumulating evidence suggests that an overexpression of utrophin may counteract some of the pathophysiological outcomes of DMD. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of utrophin in dystrophin-deficient human cardiomyocytes (CMs) and to test whether an overexpression of utrophin, implemented via the CRISPR-deadCas9-VP64 system, can improve their phenotype. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) lacking either dystrophin (DMD) or both dystrophin and utrophin (DMD KO/UTRN<sup>(+/-)</sup>). We carried out proteome analysis, which revealed considerable differences in the proteins related to muscle contraction, cell-cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix organization. Furthermore, we evaluated the role of utrophin in maintaining the physiological properties of DMD hiPSC-CMs using atomic force microscopy, patch-clamp, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation analysis. Our results showed higher values of afterhyperpolarization and altered patterns of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in DMD; the latter was further disturbed in DMD KO/UTRN<sup>(+/-)</sup> hiPSC-CMs. Utrophin upregulation improved both parameters. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that utrophin maintains the physiological functions of DMD hiPSC-CMs, and that its upregulation can compensate for the loss of dystrophin."

    "abstract": "Current gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) utilizes adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver micro-dystrophin (µDys), which does not provide full protection for striated muscles as it lacks many important functional domains of full-length (FL) dystrophin. Here we develop a triple vector system to deliver FL-dystrophin into skeletal and cardiac muscles. We split FL-dystrophin into three fragments linked to two orthogonal pairs of split intein, allowing efficient assembly of FL-dystrophin. The three fragments packaged in myotropic AAV (MyoAAV4A) restore FL-dystrophin expression in both skeletal and cardiac muscles in male mdx<sup>4cv</sup> mice. Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex components are also restored at the sarcolemma of dystrophic muscles. MyoAAV4A-delivered FL-dystrophin significantly improves muscle histopathology, contractility, and overall strength comparable to µDys, but unlike µDys, it also restores defective cavin 4 localization and associated signaling in mdx<sup>4cv</sup> heart. Therefore, our data support the feasibility of a mutation-independent FL-dystrophin gene therapy for DMD, warranting further clinical development."

Registers can facilitate therapy development, serving as a platform to study epidemiology, assess clinical trial feasibility, identify eligible candidates, collect real-world data, perform post-market surveillance, and collaborate in (inter)national data-driven initiatives. In addressing these facets, it's crucial to gather high-quality, interchangeable, and reusable data from a representative population. We introduce the Dutch Dystrophinopathy Database (DDD), a national registry for patients with DMD or BMD, and females with pathogenic DMD variants, outlining its design, governance, and use. The design of DDD is based on a system-independent information model that ensures interoperable and reusable data adhering to international standards. To maximize enrollment, patients can provide consent online and participation is allowed on different levels with contact details and clinical diagnosis as minimal requirement. Participants can opt-in for yearly online questionnaires on disease milestones and medication and to have clinical data stored from visits to one of the national reference centers. Governance involves a general board, advisory board and database management. On November 1, 2023, 742 participants were enrolled. Self-reported data were provided by 291 Duchenne, 122 Becker and 38 female participants. 96% of the participants visiting reference centers consented to store clinical data. Eligible patients were informed about clinical studies through DDD, and multiple data requests have been approved to use coded clinical data for quality control, epidemiology and natural history studies. The Dutch Dystrophinopathy Database captures long-term patient and high-quality standardized clinician reported healthcare data, supporting trial readiness, post-marketing surveillance, and effective data use using a multicenter design that is scalable to other neuromuscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Eteplirsen (Exondys 51) is an orphan drug approved for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), having received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. The primary aim of this study is to closely monitor adverse events (AEs) associated with eteplirsen and to identify emerging signals to better characterize their safety profile. AEs due to eteplirsen usage reported from the third quarter (Q3) of 2016 to the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023 were collected from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The role_code of AEs mainly includes primary suspect (PS), secondary suspect (SS), concomitant (C), and interaction (I). This study targeted reports with a role_cod of 'PS.' According to the FDA deduplication rule, the latest FDA_DT is selected when the CASEID is the same, and the higher PRIMARYID is selected when the CASEID and FDA_DT are the same. Disproportionality analyses, encompassing four algorithms for reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian configuration promotion neural network (BCPNN), and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), were utilized to quantify the signals of AEs associated with eteplirsen. From the FAERS database, a total of 13,205,369 reports were amassed throughout the study duration. Following the eradication of duplicates, the number of reports with eteplirsen designated as the PS amounted to 1480 encompassed 25 organ systems. Among these, \"general disorders and administration site conditions,\" \"injury, poisoning, and procedural complications,\" \"respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders,\" \"infections and infestations,\" \"vascular disorders,\" and \"product issues\" met at least one of the four computational criteria. Additionally, 55 Preferred Terms (PTs) aligned with the prescribed algorithms. The median time to AEs in these patients was 903 days with an interquartile range (IQR) of 269-1575 days. Moreover, 70.04 % of AEs manifested one year or more after the initiation of treatment. As an orphan drug granted accelerated approval, our study has confirmed well-known adverse drug reactions and identified potential safety issues associated with eteplirsen treatment. This has contributed to a deeper understanding of the complex interrelations between adverse reactions and the use of eteplirsen. The findings underscore the critical importance of ongoing monitoring and sustained observation to promptly detect and effectively manage AEs, thereby enhancing the overall safety and well-being of patients treated with eteplirsen for DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal genetic neuromuscular disease. Lack of dystrophin in skeletal muscles leads to intrinsic weakness, injury, subsequent degeneration and fibrosis, decreasing contractile function. Dystropathology eventually presents in all inspiratory and expiratory muscles of breathing, severely curtailing their critical function. In people with DMD, premature death is caused by respiratory or cardiac failure. There is an urgent need to develop therapies that improve quality of life and extend life expectancy in DMD. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of information on respiratory control in animal models of DMD, and respiratory outcome measures are often limited or absent in clinical trials. Characterization of respiratory performance in murine and canine models has revealed extensive remodelling of the diaphragm, the major muscle of inspiration. However, significant compensation by extradiaphragmatic muscles of breathing is evident in early disease, contributing to preservation of peak respiratory system performance. Loss of compensation afforded by accessory muscles in advanced disease is ultimately associated with compromised respiratory performance. A new and potentially more translatable murine model of DMD, the D2.mdx mouse, has recently been developed. Respiratory performance in D2.mdx mice is yet to be characterized fully. However, based on histopathological features, D2.mdx mice might serve as useful preclinical models, facilitating the testing of new therapeutics that rescue respiratory function. This review summarizes the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with DMD both in humans and in animal models, with a focus on breathing. We consider the translational value of each model to human DMD and highlight the urgent need for comprehensive characterization of breathing in representative preclinical models to better inform human trials."

    "abstract": "Gene replacement using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is a promising therapeutic approach for many diseases<sup>1,2</sup>. However, this therapeutic modality is challenged by the packaging capacity of AAVs (approximately 4.7 kilobases)<sup>3</sup>, limiting its application for disorders involving large coding sequences, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, with a 14 kilobase messenger RNA. Here we developed a new method for expressing large dystrophins by utilizing the protein trans-splicing mechanism mediated by split inteins. We identified several split intein pairs that efficiently join two or three fragments to generate a large midi-dystrophin or the full-length protein. We show that delivery of two or three AAVs into dystrophic mice results in robust expression of large dystrophins and significant physiological improvements compared with micro-dystrophins. Moreover, using the potent myotropic AAVMYO<sup>4</sup>, we demonstrate that low total doses (2 × 10<sup>13 </sup>viral genomes per kg) are sufficient to express large dystrophins in striated muscles body-wide with significant physiological corrections in dystrophic mice. Our data show a clear functional superiority of large dystrophins over micro-dystrophins that are being tested in clinical trials. This method could benefit many patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy, regardless of genotype, and could be adapted to numerous other disorders caused by mutations in large genes that exceed the AAV capacity."

We developed human Dystrophin Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cells, created by the fusion of myoblasts from normal donors and DMD patients, as a foundation for DT-DEC01 therapy for DMD. Our preclinical studies on mdx mouse models of DMD revealed enhanced dystrophin expression and functional improvements in cardiac, respiratory, and skeletal muscles after systemic intraosseous DEC administration. The current study explored the feasibility of mitochondrial transfer and fusion within the created DEC cells, which is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies for DMD. Following mitochondrial staining with MitoTracker Deep Red and MitoTracker Green dyes, mitochondrial fusion and transfer was assessed by Flow cytometry (FACS) and confocal microscopy. The PEG-mediated fusion of myoblasts from normal healthy donors (MB<sup>N</sup>/MB<sup>N</sup>) and normal and DMD-affected donors (MB<sup>N</sup>/MB<sup>DMD</sup>), confirmed the feasibility of myoblast and mitochondrial fusion and transfer. The colocalization of the mitochondrial dyes MitoTracker Deep Red and MitoTracker Green confirmed the mitochondrial chimeric state and the creation of chimeric mitochondria, as well as the transfer of healthy donor mitochondria within the created DEC cells. These findings are unique and significant, introducing the potential of DT-DEC01 therapy to restore mitochondrial function in DMD patients and in other diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <i>DMD</i> gene, which leads to a deficiency of the dystrophin protein. The main mutation types of this gene include exon deletions and duplications, point mutations, and insertions. These mutations disrupt the normal expression of dystrophin, ultimately leading to the disease. In this study, we reported a case of DMD caused by an insertion mutation in exon 59 (E59) of the <i>DMD</i> gene. The affected child exhibited significant abnormalities in related biochemical markers, early symptoms of DMD, and multiple gray hair. His mother and sister were carriers with slightly abnormal biochemical markers. The mother had mild clinical symptoms, while the sister had no clinical symptoms. Other family members were genetically and physically normal. Sequencing and sequence alignment revealed that the inserted fragment was an Alu element from the AluYa5 subfamily. This insertion produced two stop codons and a polyadenylate (polyA) tail. To understand the impact of this insertion on the <i>DMD</i> gene and its association with clinical symptoms, exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) prediction indicated that the insertion did not affect the splicing of E59. Therefore, we speculated that the insertion sequence would be present in the mRNA sequence of the <i>DMD</i> gene. The two stop codons and polyA tail likely terminate translation, preventing the production of functional dystrophin protein, which may be the mechanism leading to DMD. In addition to typical DMD symptoms, the child also exhibited premature graying of hair. This study reports, for the first time, a case of DMD caused by the insertion of an Alu element into the coding region of the <i>DMD</i> gene. This finding provides clues for studying gene mutations induced by Alu sequence insertion and expands the understanding of <i>DMD</i> gene mutations."

The severe phenotype, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), is caused by a lack of dystrophin in skeletal muscles, resulting in necrosis and regenerating fibers, inflammatory cells, and muscle fibrosis. Progressive muscle weakness is a characteristic finding of this condition. Here, we encountered a rare case of a 10-year-old patient with asymptomatic dystrophinopathy with no dystrophin expression and investigated the reason for the absence of muscle weakness to obtain therapeutic insights for DMD. Using RNA-seq analysis, gene expression in skeletal muscles was compared among patients with asymptomatic dystrophinopathy, three patients with typical DMD, and two patients without dystrophinopathy who were leading normal daily lives. Cathepsin K (CTSK), myosin heavy chain 3 (MYH3), and nodal modulator 3-like genes exhibited a >8-fold change, whereas crystallin mu gene (CRYM) showed a <1/8-fold change in patients with typical DMD compared with their expression in the patient with asymptomatic dystrophinopathy. Additionally, CTSK and MYH3 expression exhibited a >16-fold change (P < 0.01), whereas CRYM expression showed a <1/16-fold change (P < 0.01) in patients with typical DMD compared with their expression in those without dystrophinopathy. CTSK plays an essential role in skeletal muscle loss, fibrosis, and inflammation in response to muscles injected with cardiotoxin, one of the most common reagents that induce muscle injury. Increased CTSK expression is associated with muscle injury or necrosis in patients with DMD. The lack of muscle weakness in the patient with asymptomatic dystrophinopathy might be attributed to the low CTSK expression in the muscles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that CTSK expression was significantly higher in the skeletal muscles of patients with DMD with a typical phenotype than in those without dystrophinopathy."

This leads to cell membrane instability, susceptibility to contraction-induced muscle damage, subsequent muscle degeneration, and eventually disability and early death of patients. Currently, there is no cure for DMD. Our recent studies identified that lipin1 plays a critical role in maintaining myofiber stability and integrity. However, lipin1 gene expression levels are dramatically reduced in the skeletal muscles of DMD patients and mdx mice. To identify whether increased lipin1 expression could prevent dystrophic pathology, we employed unique muscle-specific mdx:lipin1 transgenic (mdx:lipin1<sup>Tg/0</sup>) mice in which lipin1 was restored in the dystrophic muscle of mdx mice, intramuscular gene delivery, as well as cell culture system. We found that increased lipin1 expression suppressed muscle degeneration and inflammation, reduced fibrosis, strengthened membrane integrity, and resulted in improved muscle contractile and lengthening force, and muscle performance in mdx:lipin1<sup>Tg/0</sup> compared to mdx mice. To confirm the role of lipin1 in dystrophic muscle, we then administered AAV1-lipin1 via intramuscular injection in mdx mice. Consistently, lipin1 restoration inhibited myofiber necroptosis and lessened muscle degeneration. Using a cell culture system, we further found that differentiated primary mdx myoblasts had elevated expression levels of necroptotic markers and medium creatine kinase (CK), which could be a result of sarcolemmal damage. Most importantly, increased lipin1 expression levels in differentiated myoblasts from mdx:lipin1<sup>Tg/0</sup> mice substantially inhibited the elevation of necroptotic markers and medium CK levels. Overall, our data suggest that lipin1 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of dystrophic muscles."

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations account for >10% of human genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis, Alagille syndrome, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A nonsense mutation results in the expression of a truncated protein, and therapeutic strategies aim to restore full-length protein expression. Most strategies under development, including small-molecule aminoglycosides, suppressor tRNAs, or the targeted degradation of termination factors, lack mRNA target selectivity and may poorly differentiate between nonsense and normal stop codons, resulting in off-target translation errors. Here, we demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides can stimulate readthrough of disease-causing nonsense codons, resulting in high yields of full-length protein in mammalian cellular lysate. Readthrough efficiency depends on the sequence context near the stop codon and on the precise targeting position of an oligonucleotide, whose interaction with mRNA inhibits peptide release to promote readthrough. Readthrough-inducing antisense oligonucleotides (R-ASOs) enhance the potency of non-specific readthrough agents, including aminoglycoside G418 and suppressor tRNA, enabling a path toward target-specific readthrough of nonsense mutations in CFTR, JAG1, DMD, BRCA1 and other mutant genes. Finally, through systematic chemical engineering, we identify heavily modified fully functional R-ASO variants, enabling future therapeutic development."

While data sharing remains critical, developing suitable methods is challenging due to the specific sensitivity and uniqueness of rare disease data. This creates a dilemma, as there is a lack of both methods and necessary data to create appropriate approaches initially. This work contributes to bridging this gap by providing synthetic datasets that can form the foundation for such developments. Using a hierarchical data generation approach parameterised with publicly available statistics, we generated datasets reflecting a random sample of rare disease patients from the United States (US) population. General demographics were obtained from the US Census Bureau, while information on disease prevalence, initial diagnosis, survival rates as well as race and sex ratios were obtained from the information provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the scientific literature. The software, which we have named SynthMD, was implemented in Python as open source using libraries such as Faker for generating individual data points. We generated three datasets focusing on three specific rare diseases with broad impact on US citizens, as well as differences in affected genders and racial groups: Sickle Cell Disease, Cystic Fibrosis, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. We present the statistics used to generate the datasets and study the statistical properties of output data. The datasets, as well as the code used to generate them, are available as Open Data and Open Source Software. The results of our work can serve as a starting point for researchers and developers working on methods and platforms that aim to improve the availability of rare disease data.

About 70% of DMD-causing mutations are exon deletion leading to frameshift of open reading frame and dystrophin deficiency. To facilitate translating human DMD-targeting CRISPR therapeutics into patients, we herein establish a genetically humanized mouse model of DMD by replacing exon 50 and 51 of mouse Dmd gene with human exon 50 sequence. This humanized mouse model recapitulats patient's DMD phenotypes of dystrophin deficiency and muscle dysfunction. Furthermore, we target splicing sites in human exon 50 with adenine base editor to induce exon skipping and robustly restored dystrophin expression in heart, tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles. Importantly, systemic delivery of base editor via adeno-associated virus in the humanized male mouse model improves the muscle function of DMD mice to the similar level of wildtype ones, indicating the therapeutic efficacy of base editing strategy in treating most of DMD types with exon deletion or point mutations via exon-skipping induction."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive X-linked neuromuscular disorder caused by the absence of functional dystrophin protein. In addition to muscle, dystrophin is expressed in the brain in both neurons and glial cells. Previous studies have shown altered white matter microstructure in patients with DMD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, DTI measures the diffusion properties of water, a ubiquitous molecule, making it difficult to unravel the underlying pathology. Diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS) is a complementary technique which measures diffusion properties of cell-specific intracellular metabolites. Here we performed both DWS and DTI measurements to disentangle intra- and extracellular contributions to white matter changes in patients with DMD. Scans were conducted in patients with DMD (15.5 ± 4.6 y/o) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (16.3 ± 3.3 y/o). DWS measurements were obtained in a volume of interest (VOI) positioned in the left parietal white matter. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated for total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), choline compounds (tCho), and total creatine (tCr). The tNAA/tCr and tCho/tCr ratios were calculated from the non-diffusion-weighted spectrum. Mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD), and fractional anisotropy of water within the VOI were extracted from DTI measurements. DWS and DTI data from patients with DMD (respectively n = 20 and n = 18) and n = 10 healthy controls were included. No differences in metabolite ADC or in concentration ratios were found between patients with DMD and controls. In contrast, water diffusion (MD, t = -2.727, p = 0.011; RD, t = -2.720, p = 0.011; AD, t = -2.715, p = 0.012) within the VOI was significantly higher in patients compared with healthy controls. Taken together, our study illustrates the potential of combining DTI and DWS to gain a better understanding of microstructural changes and their association with disease mechanisms in a clinical setting."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Deficiency of the dystrophin protein causes not only motor, but also cognitive, language, behavioural and social emotional problems. This is the first systematic review investigating five early developmental domains in boys with DMD between 0 and 6 years old. Interactions between different domains and links with mutation types and sites were explored. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. An adapted version of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Checklists for case-control and cohort studies was used to evaluate quality. Fifty-five studies of high or acceptable quality were included. One was an RCT of level 1b; 50 were cohort studies of level 2b; and four were an aggregation of case-control and cohort studies receiving levels 2b and 3b. We found that young boys with DMD experienced problems in all five developmental domains, with significant interactions between these. Several studies also showed relationships between mutation sites and outcomes. We conclude that DMD is not only characterised by motor problems but by a more global developmental delay with a large variability between boys. Our results emphasise the need for harmonisation in evaluation and follow-up of young boys with DMD. More high-quality research is needed on the different early developmental domains in young DMD to facilitate early detection of difficulties and identification of associated early intervention strategies."

In the cohort of 93 boys aged 8.54 (5.9-12.6 years), inappropriate nutritional status occurred in 41.8% of boys (underweight 11.8%, overweight 16.0%, and obesity 14.0%). In the 10-13 age group, the occurrence of overweight and underweight was the highest. Based on PNST, 15.1% of patients were at nutritional risk (≥2 points)-the most in the 14-17 age group (29%). A negative correlation was identified between PNST and z-scores of body weight, BMI, and FFMI (r Spearman = -0.49, -0.46, and -0.48, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.05). There were no differences between BMR results from indirect calorimetry and calculations from the Schofield formula for any age group. In obese boys, the caloric requirement in indirect calorimetry was significantly lower than that indicated by the calculations according to the Schofield formula (<i>p</i> < 0.028). Inappropriate nutritional status occurred in almost half of the children with DMD. The age group in which nutritional disorders were most frequently identified was 10-13 years old. PNST could be considered a tool for screening malnutrition after testing a larger group of DMD patients."

    "title": "Electrophysiologic and cardiovascular manifestations of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.",
    "abstract": "There have been significant advances in the diagnosis and management of the hereditary muscular disorders Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD). Cardiac electrophysiologic and cardiovascular involvement has long been important in the surveillance, care, and prognosis of patients with both BMD and DMD and is the leading cause of mortality in patients with DMD. With improved long-term prognosis, rhythm disorders and progressive cardiomyopathy with resultant heart failure are increasingly common. This review aimed to provide an overview to electrophysiologists and cardiologists of the cardiac electrophysiologic phenotypes and genetics of BMD and DMD and to highlight the recent discoveries that have advanced clinical course and management. A systematic review was performed of the diagnosis and management of DMD and BMD. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, Europe PubMed Central, AMED, and Embase databases were accessed for available evidence. The research reported in this paper adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Evidence from randomized controlled trials and studies cited in expert consensus and practice guidelines are examined. Advanced imaging techniques and a spectrum of rhythm disorders associated with the progressive cardiomyopathy are presented. Early initiation of heart failure therapies, the role of cardiac implantable devices, and novel gene therapies approved for use with the potential to alter the disease course are discussed. When profound cardiac and cardiac electrophysiologic involvement is diagnosed and treated earlier, outcomes for DMD and BMD patients may be improved."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic condition marked by progressive muscle degeneration, presents notable orthopaedic challenges, especially scoliosis, which deteriorates patients' quality of life by affecting sitting balance and complicating cardiac and respiratory functions. Current orthopaedic management strategies emphasize early intervention with corticosteroids to delay disease progression and the use of surgical spinal fusion to address severe scoliosis, aiming to enhance sitting balance, alleviate discomfort, and potentially extend patient lifespan. Despite advancements, optimal management requires ongoing research to refine therapeutic approaches, ensuring improved outcomes for patients with DMD. This review synthesizes recent findings on surgical and nonsurgical interventions, underscoring the importance of a multidisciplinary approach tailored to the dynamic needs of patients with DMD."

    "abstract": "To quantify the magnitude of an ISPOR novel value element, insurance value, as applied to new treatments for a rare, severe disease with pediatric onset: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Prospective survey of individuals planning to have children in the future. A survey was administered to US adults (aged ≥ 21 years) planning to have a child in the future to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance coverage for a new hypothetical DMD treatment that improved mortality and morbidity relative to the current standard of care. To identify an indifference point between status quo insurance and insurance with additional cost that would cover the treatment if respondents had a child with DMD, a multiple random staircase design was used. Insurance value-the value individuals receive from a reduction in future health risks-was calculated as the difference between respondent's WTP and what a risk-neutral individual would pay. The risk-neutral value was the product of the (1) probability of having a child with DMD (decision weighted), (2) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from the new treatment, and (3) WTP per QALY. Among 207 respondents, 80.2% (n = 166) were aged 25 to 44 years, and 59.9% (n = 124) were women. WTP for insurance coverage of the hypothetical treatment was $973 annually, whereas the decision-weighted risk-neutral value was $452 per year. Thus, insurance value constituted 53.5% ($520) of value for new DMD treatments. Individuals planning to have children in the future are willing to pay more for insurance coverage of novel DMD treatments than is assumed under risk-neutral, QALY-based frameworks."

    "title": "The Usefulness of Determining Plasma and Tissue Concentrations of Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligonucleotides to Estimate Their Efficacy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Patients.",
    "abstract": "Currently, four kinds of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), such as viltolarsen, have been approved for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); however, it is unclear whether human efficacy can be estimated using plasma concentrations. This study summarizes the tissue distribution of viltolarsen in mice and cynomolgus monkeys and evaluates the relationship between exposure and efficacy based on exon skipping. In the tissue distribution studies, all muscles in DMD-model mice showed higher concentrations of viltolarsen than those in wild-type mice and cynomolgus monkeys, and the concentrations in skeletal muscle were correlated with the exon-skipping efficiency in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, a highly sensitive bioanalytical method using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry shows promise for determining plasma concentrations up to a later time point, and the tissue (muscle)/plasma concentration ratio (Kp) in DMD-model mice was shown to be useful for predicting changes in pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in humans. Our results suggest that pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD analysis can be conducted by using the human PK profile or Kp values and skipping efficiency in DMD-model mice. This information will be useful for the efficient and effective development of PMOs as therapeutic agents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We evaluated the relationship between the plasma or tissue concentrations and the efficiency of exon skipping for viltolarsen as an example phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers in the skeletal and cardiac muscle of mice and cynomolgus monkeys for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis. The results suggest that PK/PD analysis can be conducted by using the human PK profile or tissue (muscle)/plasma concentration ratios and skipping efficiency in DMD-model mice."

    "abstract": "Recent clinical guidelines recommend that adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are on daily glucocorticoid treatment should be offered pubertal induction in order to ensure adult levels of sex hormones as they reach adulthood. However, it remains unclear how gonadal status, including androgen concentrations, impacts physical function and future fertility. The aim of this study was to give a voice to adults with DMD, exploring their perspectives around sexual health, hormone treatment, and fertility. Qualitative data was collected from six adults with DMD through two online focus groups. Participants were recruited through Pathfinders Neuromuscular Alliance and Duchenne UK and invited to take part if they had DMD and were 18 years of age or older. Conversations were transcribed verbatim and an interpretivist paradigm was used with thematic analysis. The main themes identified were (1) the need for communication and information about sexual health, (2) dealing with the potential fear of rejection, (3) physical barriers to relationships including sex, (4) testosterone supplementation in DMD, and (5) parenthood and fertility. We recommend that clinicians work with young people with DMD individually, to explore the benefits of testosterone treatment for them and their personal sexual health needs. If they are offered treatment, this should always be accompanied by the opportunity for psychological support. This work highlights the need for further research to establish the role of testosterone supplementation in adults with DMD and its effects on fertility and the value of specific emotional and practical support for sexual health."

    "abstract": "DUX4 has been widely reported in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, but its role in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is unclear. Dux is the mouse paralog of DUX4. In Dux<sup>-/-</sup> mdx mice, forelimb grip strength test and treadmill test were performed, and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) contraction properties were measured to assess skeletal muscle function. Pathological changes in mice were determined by serum CK and LDH levels and muscle Masson staining. Inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function indicators were detected using kits. Primary muscle satellite cells were isolated, and the antioxidant molecule Nrf2 was detected. MTT assay and Edu assay were used to evaluate proliferation and TUNEL assay for cell death. The results show that the deletion of Dux enhanced forelimb grip strength and EDL contractility, prolonged running time and distance in mdx mice. Deleting Dux also attenuated muscle fibrosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in mdx mice. Furthermore, Dux deficiency promoted proliferation and survival of muscle satellite cells by increasing Nrf2 levels in mdx mice."

Although prolonged exposure is associated with multiple endocrine side effects, current guidelines related to monitoring and management of endocrinopathies are suboptimal. We aim to explore community perceptions of endocrine related complications in patients with DMD, assess current level of understanding, and desire for further education. A 31-item online survey was sent through Parent Project to Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) to Duchenne Registry members to be completed by patients or their caretakers. Response rate was 55% (<i>n</i> = 75). Steroids were taken by 93%, but only 50% were followed by endocrinology and 21% report never been seen by endocrinology. Bone health was discussed with 87% of patients and 60% were diagnosed with osteoporosis. Delayed puberty was discussed with 41% of patients with 23% receiving testosterone therapy. About half the patients reported a diagnosis of slowed growth. Only 51% of the participants recalled discussing adrenal insufficiency. Obesity was discussed with 59% of participants. Families felt education about steroid-induced endocrinopathies to be very or extremely important and prefer to discuss about this at the beginning of their steroid therapy. This demonstrates significant gaps in education and access to endocrine care in patients with DMD."

    "abstract": "Evaluations of treatment efficacy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disease that results in progressive muscle wasting, require an understanding of the 'meaningfulness' of changes in functional measures. We estimated the minimal detectable change (MDC) for selected motor function measures in ambulatory DMD, i.e., the minimal degree of measured change needed to be confident that true underlying change has occurred rather than transient variation or measurement error. MDC estimates were compared across multiple data sources, representing >1000 DMD patients in clinical trials and real-world clinical practice settings. Included patients were ambulatory, aged ≥4 to <18 years and receiving steroids. Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for worsening were also estimated. Estimated MDC thresholds for >80% confidence in true change were 2.8 units for the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score, 1.3 seconds for the 4-stair climb (4SC) completion time, 0.36 stairs/second for 4SC velocity and 36.3 meters for the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). MDC estimates were similar across clinical trial and real-world data sources, and tended to be slightly larger than MCIDs for these measures. The identified thresholds can be used to inform endpoint definitions, or as benchmarks for monitoring individual changes in motor function in ambulatory DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating X-linked genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration due to mutations in the dystrophin gene. This results in the absence or dysfunction of the dystrophin protein, leading to muscle weakness, loss of ambulation, respiratory issues, and cardiac complications, often leading to premature death. Recently, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for DMD. Notably, the FDA has conditionally approved four ASO therapies for DMD, with numerous others in various stages of clinical development, indicating the growing interest and potential in this field. To enhance ASO-based therapies, researchers have explored the novel concept of conjugating peptides to the phosphorodiamidate morpholino backbone (PMO) of ASOs, leading to the development of peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs). These PPMOs have demonstrated significantly improved pharmacokinetic profiles, potentially augmenting their therapeutic effectiveness. Despite the optimism surrounding ASOs and PPMOs, concerns persist regarding their efficacy and safety. To comprehensively evaluate these therapies, it is imperative to expand patient populations in clinical trials and conduct thorough investigations into the associated risks. This article provides a comprehensive review and discussion of the available data pertaining to adverse reactions and toxicology associated with FDA-approved ASO drugs for DMD. Furthermore, it offers insights into the emerging category of peptide-conjugated ASO drugs those are clinical and preclinical trials, shedding light on their potential benefits and challenges."

    "title": "Essential components of an effective transition from paediatric to adult neurologist care for adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy; a consensus derived using the Delphi methodology in Eastern Europe, Greece and Israel.",
    "abstract": "An increasing number of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) now have access to improved standard of care and disease modifying treatments, which improve the clinical course of DMD and extend life expectancy beyond 30 years of age. A key issue for adolescent DMD patients is the transition from paediatric- to adult-oriented healthcare. Adolescents and adults with DMD have unique but highly complex healthcare needs associated with long-term steroid use, orthopaedic, respiratory, cardiac, psychological, and gastrointestinal problems meaning that a comprehensive transition process is required. A sub-optimal transition into adult care can have disruptive and deleterious consequences for a patient's long-term care. This paper details the results of a consensus amongst clinicians on transitioning adolescent DMD patients from paediatric to adult neurologists that can act as a guide to best practice to ensure patients have continuous comprehensive care at every stage of their journey. The consensus was derived using the Delphi methodology. Fifty-three statements were developed by a Steering Group (the authors of this paper) covering seven topics: Define the goals of transition, Preparing the patient, carers/parents and the adult centre, The transition process at the paediatric centre, The multidisciplinary transition summary - Principles, The multidisciplinary transition summary - Content, First visit in the adult centre, Evaluation of transition. The statements were shared with paediatric and adult neurologists across Central Eastern Europe (CEE) as a survey requesting their level of agreement with each statement. Data from 60 responders (54 full responses and six partial responses) were included in the data set analysis. A consensus was agreed across 100% of the statements. It is hoped that the findings of this survey which sets out agreed best practice statements, and the transfer template documents developed, will be widely used and so facilitate an effective transition from paediatric to adult care for adolescents with DMD."

    "title": "Treadmill running and mechanical overloading improved the strength of the plantaris muscle in the dystrophin-desmin double knockout (DKO) mouse.",
    "abstract": "Limited knowledge exists regarding the chronic effect of muscular exercise on muscle function in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we determined the effects of 1 month of voluntary wheel running (WR), 1 month of enforced treadmill running (TR) and 1 month of mechanical overloading resulting from the removal of the synergic muscles (OVL) in mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin (DKO). Additionally, we examined the effect of activin receptor administration (AR). DKO mice, displaying severe muscle weakness, atrophy and greater susceptibility to contraction-induced functional loss, were exercised or treated with AR at 1 month of age and in situ force production of lower leg muscle was measured at the age of 2 months. We found that TR and OVL increased absolute maximal force and the rate of force development of the plantaris muscle in DKO mice. In contrast, those of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle remained unaffected by TR and WR. Furthermore, the effects of TR and OVL on plantaris muscle function in DKO mice closely resembled those in mdx mice, a less severe murine DMD model. AR also improved absolute maximal force and the rate of force development of the TA muscle in DKO mice. In conclusion, exercise training improved plantaris muscle weakness in severely affected dystrophic mice. Consequently, these preclinical results may contribute to fostering further investigations aimed at assessing the potential benefits of exercise for DMD patients, particularly resistance training involving a low number of intense muscle contractions. KEY POINTS: Very little is known about the effects of exercise training in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). One reason is that it is feared that chronic muscular exercise, particularly that involving intense muscle contractions, could exacerbate the disease. In DKO mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin, characterized by severe lower leg muscle weakness, atrophy and fragility in comparison to the less severe DMD mdx model, we found that enforced treadmill running improved absolute maximal force of the plantaris muscle, while that of tibialis anterior muscle remained unaffected by both enforced treadmill and voluntary wheel running. Furthermore, mechanical overloading, a non-physiological model of chronic resistance exercise, reversed plantaris muscle weakness. Consequently, our findings may have the potential to alleviate concerns and pave the way for exploring the prescription of endurance and resistance training as a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of dystrophic patients. Additionally, such interventions may serve in mitigating the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by physical inactivity."

    "abstract": "To investigate the epidemiological characteristics and mutation spectrum of monogenic diseases in Chinese population through a large-scale, multicenter carrier screening. This study was conducted among a total of 33 104 participants (16 610 females) from 12 clinical centers across China.Carrier status for 223 genes was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing and different PCR methods. The overall combined carrier frequency was 55.58% for 197 autosomal genes and 1.84% for 26 X-linked genes in these participants.Among the 16 669 families, 874 at-risk couples (5.24%) were identified.Specifically, 584 couples (3.50%) were at risk for autosomal genes, 306(1.84%) for X-linked genes, and 16 for both autosomal and X-linked genes.The most frequently detected autosomal at-risk genes included GJB2(autosomal recessive deafness type 1A, 393 couples), HBA1/HBA2(α-thalassemia, 36 couples), PAH (phenylketonuria, 14 couples), and SMN1(spinal muscular atrophy, 14 couples).The most frequently detected X-linked at-risk genes were G6PD (G6PD deficiency, 236 couples), DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 23 couples), and FMR1(fragile X syndrome, 17 couples).After excluding GJB2 c.109G>A, the detection rate of at-risk couples was 3.91%(651/16 669), which was lowered to 1.72%(287/16 669) after further excluding G6PD.The theoretical incidence rate of severe monogenic birth defects was approximately 4.35‰(72.5/16 669).Screening for a battery of the top 22 most frequent genes in the at-risk couples could detect over 95% of at-risk couples, while screening for the top 54 genes further increased the detection rate to over 99%. This study reveals the carrier frequencies of 223 monogenic genetic disorders in the Chinese population and provides evidence for carrier screening strategy development and panel design tailored to the Chinese population.In carrier testing, genetic counseling for specific genes or gene variants can be challenging, and the couples need to be informed of these difficulties before testing and provided with options for not screening these genes or gene variants."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disease caused by the absence of dystrophin protein. One current DMD therapeutic strategy, exon skipping, produces a truncated dystrophin isoform using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). However, the potential of exon skipping therapeutics has not been fully realized as increases in dystrophin protein have been minimal in clinical trials. Here, we investigate how miR-146a-5p, which is highly elevated in dystrophic muscle, impacts dystrophin protein levels. We find inflammation strongly induces miR-146a in dystrophic, but not wild-type myotubes. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that the dystrophin 3' UTR harbors a miR-146a binding site, and subsequent luciferase assays demonstrate miR-146a binding inhibits dystrophin translation. In dystrophin-null <i>mdx52</i> mice, co-injection of miR-146a reduces dystrophin restoration by an exon 51 skipping PMO. To directly investigate how miR-146a impacts therapeutic dystrophin rescue, we generated <i>mdx52</i> with body-wide miR-146a deletion (<i>146aX</i>). Administration of an exon skipping PMO via intramuscular or intravenous injection markedly increases dystrophin protein levels in <i>146aX</i> vs. <i>mdx52</i> muscles while skipped dystrophin transcript levels are unchanged supporting a post-transcriptional mechanism of action. Together, these data show that miR-146a expression opposes therapeutic dystrophin restoration, suggesting miR-146a inhibition warrants further research as a potential DMD exon skipping co-therapy."

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapies for certain muscle disorders require regulatory cassettes that provide high-level, striated muscle-specific activity. However, cardiotoxicity has emerged as a serious concern in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and X-linked myotubular myopathy. While this may be caused by systemic inflammatory effects of the treatment, high transgene expression in the heart may also play a role. Thus, certain muscle disorders may require a modulated level of therapeutic expression in the heart, while others may not require any cardiac expression at all. Additionally, the size of some cargos requires regulatory cassettes to be small enough that large cDNAs and other therapeutic payloads can be accommodated. Thus, we have performed enhancer/promoter optimization to develop highly minimized regulatory cassettes that are active in skeletal muscles, with either low or no detectable activity in cardiac muscle. Our No-heart (NH) cassette is active in most skeletal muscles, but exhibits only very low activity in extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, and diaphragm, and no activity in the heart. By contrast, our Have a Little Heart (HLH) cassette displays high activity in most skeletal muscles, comparable to the ∼800-bp CK8 cassette, with increased activity in EDL, soleus, and diaphragm, and low activity in the heart. Due to their small size, these cassettes can be used in therapeutic strategies with both flexible (<i>e.g.,</i> antisense) and stringent (<i>e.g.,</i> CRISPR/Cas or bicistronic) size limitations. Thus, our new cassettes may be useful for gene therapies of muscle disorders in which the need for low or almost no expression in cardiac muscle would outweigh the need for high levels of therapeutic product in certain skeletal muscles."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked disease that leads to premature death due to the loss of dystrophin. Current strategies predominantly focus on the therapeutic treatment of affected skeletal muscle tissue. However, certain results point to the fact that with successful treatment of skeletal muscle, DMD-exposed latent phenotypes in tissues, such as cardiac and smooth muscle, might lead to adverse effects and even death. Likewise, it is now clear that the absence of dystrophin affects the function of the nervous system, and that this phenotype is more pronounced when shorter dystrophins are absent, in addition to the full-length dystrophin that is present predominantly in the muscle. Here, I focus on the systemic aspects of DMD, highlighting the ubiquitous expression of the dystrophin gene in human tissues. Furthermore, I describe therapeutic strategies that have been tested in the clinic and point to unresolved questions regarding the function of distinct dystrophin isoforms, and the possibility of current therapeutic strategies to tackle phenotypes that relate to their absence."

A 40-year-old man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy-related cardiomyopathy attempted suicide and developed new-onset AF after zolpidem overdose. One year before admission, the patient visited our clinic due to chest discomfort and fatigue after daily walks for 1 month; both electrocardiography (ECG) and 24-hour Holter ECG results did not detect AF. After administration of cardiac medication (digoxin 0.125 mg/day, spironolactone 40 mg/day, furosemide 20 mg/day, bisoprolol 5 mg/day, sacubitril/valsartan 12/13 mg/day), he felt better. AF had never been observed before this admission via continuous monitoring during follow-up. Sixteen days before admission, the patient saw a sleep specialist and started zolpidem tartrate tablets (10 mg/day) due to insomnia for 6 months; ECG results revealed no significant change. The night before admission, the patient attempted suicide by overdosing on 40 mg of zolpidem after an argument, which resulted in severe lethargy. Upon admission, his ECG revealed new-onset AF, necessitating immediate cessation of zolpidem. Nine hours into admission, AF spontaneously terminated into normal sinus rhythm. Results from the ECG on the following days and the 24-hour Holter ECG at 1-month follow-up showed that AF was not detected. This study provides valuable clinical evidence indicating that zolpidem overdose may induce AF in patients with cardiomyopathy. It serves as a critical warning for clinicians when prescribing zolpidem, particularly for patients with existing heart conditions. Further large-scale studies are needed to validate this finding and to explore the mechanisms between zolpidem and AF."

To aid in healthcare providers' understanding of the symptoms of disease that impact patients' experience, this study explored children's physical functioning, activities of daily living (ADLs), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after receiving eteplirsen, a weekly infusion indicated for individuals with DMD with exon 51 skip-amenable mutations. Fifteen caregivers of male individuals with DMD participated in a 60-min, semi-structured interview. Open-ended questioning explored changes in the children's condition or maintenance in abilities since eteplirsen initiation. Children with DMD (age 7-15 years [mean 10.9]; steroid treatment at interview, n = 8; time since eteplirsen initiation 3-24 months [mean 14.9]) were described by caregivers as ambulatory (n = 9) and non-ambulatory (n = 6). Caregivers of ambulatory children reported improvements or maintenance of walking ability (n = 7/9), running (n = 6/9), and using stairs (n = 4/9). Continued decline in using stairs was reported by two caregivers. In upper-limb functioning, improvements or maintenances in fine-motor movements were reported by nearly half of all caregivers (n = 7/15), with one caregiver noting a continued decline. Subsequent improvements or maintenances in ADLs were described. Improvements or maintenances in fatigue (n = 9/15), muscle weakness (n = 7/15), and pain (n = 6/15) were reported, although some caregivers described a continued decline (n = 3/15 fatigue, n = 1/15 muscle weakness, n = 2/15 pain). Importantly, most caregivers who reported maintenances in ability perceived this as a positive outcome (n = 6/9). This exploratory study indicated that most caregivers perceived improvements or maintenances in aspects of their child's physical functioning, ADLs, and HRQoL since eteplirsen initiation, which they perceived to be a positive outcome."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is marked by the genetic deficiency of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle whose consequence is a cascade of cellular changes that predispose the susceptibility to contraction injury central to DMD pathology. Recent evidence identified the proliferation of microtubules enriched in post-translationally modified tubulin as a consequence of dystrophins absence that increases the passive mechanics of the muscle fiber and the excess mechanotransduction elicited reactive oxygen species and calcium signals that promote contraction injury. Motivated by evidence that acutely normalizing the disease microtubule alterations reduced contraction injury in murine DMD muscle (<i>mdx</i>), here we sought the direct impact of these microtubule alterations independent of dystrophins absence and the multitude of other changes consequent to dystrophic disease. To this end we used acute pharmacologic (epithiolone-D, EpoD; 4 hours) or genetic (vashohibin-2 and small vasohibin binding protein overexpression via AAV9; 2 weeks) strategies to effectively model the proliferation of detyrosination enriched microtubules in the <i>mdx</i> muscle. Quantifying <i>in vivo</i> nerve evoked plantarflexor function we find no alteration in peak torque nor contraction kinetics in WT mice modeling these DMD relevant MT alterations. Quantifying the susceptibility to eccentric contraction injury we show EpoD treatment proffered a small but significant protection from contraction injury while VASH/SVBP had no discernable impact. We conclude that the disease dependent MT alterations act in concert with additional cellular changes to predispose contraction injury in DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin-encoding gene that leads to muscle necrosis and degeneration with chronic inflammation during growth, resulting in progressive generalized weakness of the skeletal and cardiac muscles. We previously demonstrated the therapeutic effects of systemic administration of dental pulp mesenchymal stromal cells (DPSCs) in a DMD animal model. We showed preservation of long-term muscle function and slowing of disease progression. However, little is known regarding the effects of cell therapy on the metabolic abnormalities in DMD. Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive effects of DPSCs and their influence on DMD metabolism. A comprehensive metabolomics-based approach was employed, and an ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to identify dystrophy-specific metabolomic impairments in the <i>mdx</i> mice to assess the therapeutic response to our established systemic DPSC-mediated cell therapy approach. We identified DMD-specific impairments in metabolites and their responses to systemic DPSC treatment. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the metabolomics-based approach and provide insights into the therapeutic effects of DPSCs in DMD. Our findings could help to identify molecular marker targets for therapeutic intervention and predict long-term therapeutic efficacy."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare disease wherein air accumulates in the intestinal subserosa and submucosa, causing multiple gaseous cysts within the gastrointestinal wall. While PCI has various known risk factors, reports identifying muscular diseases as a factor are scarce. The aim of this study is to elucidate the clinical characteristics of PCI in muscle disease. We present a case series of five cases, including two cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and three cases of rare congenital myopathies. All cases are of male patients, with poor intestinal peristalsis and constipation, who underwent tube feeding and mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. They had no signs of severe complications, such as intestinal necrosis, and all of them improved with conservative treatment. Case 1 is a 23-year-old man with DMD who developed cardiopulmonary arrest at the age of 20 years. Pulmonary hemorrhage occurred three months before the incidental detection of PCI in the ascending colon, which resolved with conservative oxygen treatment. Case 2 is a 25-year-old man with DMD who progressed to immobility necessitating tracheostomy at the age of 20 years. He experienced persistent abdominal pain and nausea, and PCI was detected in the cecum and ascending colon. He showed near-complete resolution of PCI after three months of conservative treatment. Case 3 is a six-year-old boy with reducing body myopathy. Constipation was diagnosed at four years of age. He experienced intermittent bloody stools, leading to the incidental detection of PCI at six years of age. After two months of conservative treatment, the PCI resolved with no subsequent recurrence. Case 4 is a 33-year-old man with infantile severe myotubular myopathy. He required mechanical ventilation immediately after birth and later underwent tracheostomy and tube feeding due to complications. At the age of 27 years, PCI was incidentally detected on abdominal CT. He had episodes of remission and worsening for a few years; however, PCI completely resolved after three years. Case 5 is a 27-year-old man with nemaline myopathy. At the age of 14 years, he had persistent bloody stools. After lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, he was diagnosed with PCI with numerous rectal cysts. PCI required no specific therapeutic intervention. There was spontaneous resolution of PCI and bloody stools. Given that PCI lacks specific symptoms and cases with muscular diseases often experience abdominal issues, many cases are liable to be overlooked or misdiagnosed. Cases with muscular diseases complaining of persistent abdominal symptoms should undergo radiographic imaging to rule out PCI."

    "abstract": "Redox modifications to the plasma protein albumin have the potential to be used as biomarkers of disease progression and treatment efficacy in pathologies associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. One such pathology is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal childhood disease characterised by severe muscle wasting. We have previously shown in the <i>mdx</i> mouse model of DMD that plasma albumin thiol oxidation is increased; therefore, the first aim of this paper was to establish that albumin thiol oxidation in plasma reflects levels within <i>mdx</i> muscle tissue. We therefore developed a method to measure tissue albumin thiol oxidation. We show that albumin thiol oxidation was increased in both <i>mdx</i> muscle and plasma, with levels correlated with measures of dystropathology. In dystrophic muscle, albumin content was associated with areas of myonecrosis. The second aim was to test the ability of plasma thiol oxidation to track acute changes in dystropathology: we therefore subjected <i>mdx</i> mice to a single treadmill exercise session (known to increase myonecrosis) and took serial blood samples. This acute exercise caused a transient increase in total plasma albumin oxidation and measures of dystropathology. Together, these data support the use of plasma albumin thiol oxidation as a biomarker to track active myonecrosis in DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most frequent and severe childhood muscle diseases. Its pathophysiology is multifaceted and still incompletely understood, but we and others have previously shown that oxidative stress plays an important role. In particular, we have demonstrated that inhibition of mitochondrial monoamine oxidases could improve some functional and biohumoral markers of the pathology. In the present study we report the use of dystrophic <i>mdx</i> mice to evaluate the efficacy of a dual monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)/semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) inhibitor, PXS-5131, in reducing inflammation and fibrosis and improving muscle function. We found that a one-month treatment starting at three months of age was able to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltrate in the tibialis anterior (TA) and diaphragm muscles. Importantly, we also observed a marked improvement in the capacity of the gastrocnemius muscle to maintain its force when challenged with eccentric contractions. Upon performing a bulk RNA-seq analysis, PXS-5131 treatment affected the expression of genes involved in inflammatory processes and tissue remodeling. We also studied the effect of prolonged treatment in older dystrophic mice, and found that a three-month administration of PXS-5131 was able to greatly reduce the progression of fibrosis not only in the diaphragm but also in the heart. Taken together, these results suggest that PXS-5131 is an effective inhibitor of fibrosis and inflammation in dystrophic muscles, a finding that could open a new therapeutic avenue for DMD patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a disease that primarily affects males and causes a gradual loss of muscle strength. This results in a deterioration of motor skills and functional mobility, which can impact the performance of various occupations. Individuals with DMD often rely heavily on caregivers to assist with daily activities, which can lead to caregiver burden. A case study was conducted to explore and describe potential variations in the performance of a young adult diagnosed with DMD and his caregivers resulting from the integration of smart speakers (SS)-controlled Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the home environment. The study also examined the potential of SS as an environment control unit (ECU) and analysed variations in caregiver burden. Smart devices and SS were installed in the most frequently used spaces, namely, the bedroom and living room. The study employed WebQDA software to perform content analysis and Microsoft Excel to calculate the scores of the structured instruments. The implementation of the IoT-assisted environment compensated for previously physical tasks, resulting in a slight increase in independent performance and reduced demands on caregivers."

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations are genetic mutations that create premature termination codons (PTCs), leading to truncated, defective proteins in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, Dravet syndrome, Hurler syndrome, Beta thalassemia, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and even cancer. These mutations can also trigger a cellular surveillance mechanism known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) that degrades the PTC-containing mRNA. The activation of NMD can attenuate the consequences of truncated, defective, and potentially toxic proteins in the cell. Since approximately 20% of all single-point mutations are disease-causing nonsense mutations, it is not surprising that this field has received significant attention, resulting in a remarkable advancement in recent years. In fact, since our last review on this topic, new examples of nonsense suppression approaches have been reported, namely new ways of promoting the translational readthrough of PTCs or inhibiting the NMD pathway. With this review, we update the state-of-the-art technologies in nonsense suppression, focusing on novel modalities with therapeutic potential, such as small molecules (readthrough agents, NMD inhibitors, and molecular glue degraders); antisense oligonucleotides; tRNA suppressors; ADAR-mediated RNA editing; targeted pseudouridylation; and gene/base editing. While these various modalities have significantly advanced in their development stage since our last review, each has advantages (e.g., ease of delivery and specificity) and disadvantages (manufacturing complexity and off-target effect potential), which we discuss here."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic disorders that lead to muscle wasting and loss of muscle function. Identifying genetic modifiers that alleviate symptoms or enhance the severity of a primary disease helps to understand mechanisms behind disease pathology and facilitates discovery of molecular targets for therapy. Several muscular dystrophies are caused by genetic defects in the components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein adhesion complex (DGC). Thrombospondin-4 overexpression has been shown to mitigate dystrophic disease in mouse models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (dystrophin deficiency) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2F (LGMD2F, δ-sarcoglycan deficiency), while deletion of the thrombospondin-4 gene exacerbated the diseases. Hence, thrombospondin-4 has been considered a candidate molecule for therapy of muscular dystrophies involving the DGC. We have investigated whether thrombospondin-4 could act as a genetic modifier for other DGC-associated diseases: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2E (LGMD2E, β-sarcoglycan deficiency) and laminin α2 chain-deficient muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD). Deletion of the thrombospondin-4 gene in mouse models for LGMD2E and LAMA2-RD, respectively, did not result in worsening of the dystrophic phenotype. Loss of thrombospondin-4 did not enhance sarcolemma damage and did not impair trafficking of transmembrane receptors integrin α7β1 and dystroglycan in double knockout muscles. Our results suggest that thrombospondin-4 might not be a relevant therapeutic target for all muscular dystrophies involving the DGC. This data also demonstrates that molecular pathology between very similar diseases like LGMD2E and 2F can differ significantly."

Periodic limb movements (PLMs) have an increased prevalence in adults with NMD and may contribute to sleep disturbance in this population. We assessed the prevalence of PLMs in children with NMD or CP. Retrospective review of polysomnography (PSG) with leg electromyography in children age 1-18 years with NMD (including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy) or CP performed at a paediatric sleep centre 2004-2022. Leg electromyography was available in at least 1 PSG in 239 children (125 NMD, 114 CP), and in 2 PSGs in 105 children (73 NMD, 32 CP). At initial PSG, 72 (30 %) were female with a median age 9y and respiratory disturbance index 3.5/h (interquartile range 1.3-9.9/h). Elevated PLM index (PLMI; >5/h) occurred in 9.6 % of each of the CP and NMD groups, quantified by initial PSG. Overall, PLMI increased from baseline (median 0, maximum 33/h) to follow-up (median 0, maximum 55.8/h; p < 0.05). In those with an elevated PLMI, arousal percentage attributable to PLMs was up to 25 % (median 7.5 %). Elevated PLMI occurred at a higher prevalence in children with NMD and CP than reported in other clinic-referred paediatric populations. It is important that PLMs are not overlooked as identification and treatment may help improve sleep outcomes. Further research is required to understand the pathophysiology and consequences of PLMs specifically in this population."

    "title": "Investigating the Involvement of C-X-C Motif Chemokine 5 and P2X7 Purinoceptor in Ectopic Calcification in Mouse Models of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Ectopic calcification of myofibers is an early pathogenic feature in patients and animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In previous studies using the Dmd<sup>mdx-βgeo</sup> mouse model, we found that the dystrophin-null phenotype exacerbates this abnormality and that mineralised myofibers are surrounded by macrophages. Furthermore, the P2X7 purinoceptor, functioning in immune cells offers protection against dystrophic calcification. In the present study, by exploring transcriptomic data from Dmd<sup>mdx</sup> mice, we hypothesised these effects to be mediated by C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5) downstream of P2X7 activation. We found that CXCL5 is upregulated in the quadriceps muscles of Dmd<sup>mdx-βgeo</sup> mice compared to wild-type controls. In contrast, at the cell level, dystrophic (SC5) skeletal muscle cells secreted less CXCL5 chemokine than wild-type (IMO) controls. Although release from IMO cells was increased by P2X7 activation, this could not explain the elevated CXCL5 levels observed in dystrophic muscle tissue. Instead, we found that CXCL5 is released by dystrophin-null macrophages in response to P2X7 activation, suggesting that macrophages are the source of CXCL5 in dystrophic muscles. The effects of CXCL5 upon mineralisation were investigated using the Alizarin Red assay to quantify calcium deposition in vitro. In basal (low phosphate) media, CXCL5 increased calcification in IMO but not SC5 myoblasts. However, in cultures treated in high phosphate media, to mimic dysregulated phosphate metabolism occurring in DMD, CXCL5 decreased calcification in both IMO and SC5 cells. These data indicate that CXCL5 is part of a homoeostatic mechanism regulating intracellular calcium, that CXCL5 can be released by macrophages in response to the extracellular ATP damage-associated signal, and that CXCL5 can be part of a damage response to protect against ectopic calcification. This mechanism is affected by DMD gene mutations."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive disorder and the most common type of muscular dystrophy in children. As newborn screening (NBS) for DMD undergoes evaluation for the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel and is already mandated in multiple states, refining NBS algorithms is of utmost importance. NBS for DMD involves measuring creatine kinase-MM (CK-MM) concentration-a biomarker of muscle damage-in dried blood spots. The current test is FDA-approved for samples obtained less than 72 h after birth. Separate reference ranges are needed for samples collected later than 72 h after birth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between age and CK-MM in presumed healthy newborns to inform NBS algorithm designs. In patients with DMD, CK-MM is persistently elevated in childhood and adolescence, while it may be transiently elevated for other reasons in healthy newborns. CK-MM decrease over time was demonstrated by a population sample of 20,306 presumed healthy newborns tested between 0 and 60 days of life and repeat testing of 53 newborns on two separate days. In the population sample, CK-MM concentration was highest in the second 12 h period of life (median = 318 ng/mL) when only 57.6% of newborns tested below 360 ng/mL, the lowest previously published cutoff. By 72 h of age, median CK-MM concentration was 97 ng/mL, and 96.0% of infants had concentrations below 360 ng/mL. Between 72 h and 60 days, median CK-MM concentration ranged from 32 to 37 ng/mL. Establishing age-related cutoffs is crucial for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of NBS for DMD."

The research involved 38 children who were diagnosed with DMD, as well as 20 healthy controls aged between 7 and 18 years. The KVIQ-10 was assessed for its test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct and concurrent validity. The Motor Imagery Questionnaire for Children (MIQ-C) was selected as the gold standard test for concurrent validity. Cognitive function was assessed using the Modified Mini Mental Test (MMMT) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). KVIQ-10 showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC>0.90) and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha>0.70). A moderate-to-strong association was found between KVIQ-10 and MIQ-C subscales (p < 0.001). KVIQ-10 and MIQ-C subscores were statistically lower in the DMD group (p ≤ 0.05). A correlation was found between MoCA and KVIQ-10 in children with DMD (p ≤ 0.05).

The aim of this study was to report the frequency of delayed puberty in DMD from examination by a paediatric endocrinologist alongside detailed endocrine investigations. All boys with DMD aged at least 14 years in January 2022 known to the paediatric neuromuscular service (2016-2022) were included. Delayed puberty was defined based on testicular volume and genital staging in comparison to a published puberty nomogram. Twenty-four out of 37 boys (65%) had evidence of delayed puberty and 23/24 (96%) were on glucocorticoid therapy, all of whom were on daily glucocorticoid. However, 7/13 (54%) with normal timing of puberty were on glucocorticoid; 2/7 (29%) were on the intermittent regimen. Of those who were on daily glucocorticoid therapy at the time of assessment of puberty, 23/28 (82%) had evidence of delayed puberty. In boys with delayed puberty, endocrine investigations showed low luteinizing hormone with undetectable testosterone levels, a pre-pubertal response with lutenizing hormone releasing hormone test and sub-optimal testosterone levels with prolonged human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation. The frequency of delayed puberty in boys with DMD was 65%. Eighty-two percent of adolescent boys with DMD on daily glucocorticoid had evidence of delayed puberty. Biochemical investigations point to functional central hypogonadism in these adolescents. Our data supports the routine monitoring of puberty in boys with DMD."

    "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single stranded nucleic acids that target RNA. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ASOs for several diseases. ASOs utilize three principal modes of action (MOA). The first MOA is initiated by base-pairing between the ASO and its target mRNA, followed by RNase H-dependent mRNA degradation. The second MOA is triggered by ASOs that occlude splice acceptor sites in pre-mRNAs leading to skipping of a mutation-bearing exon. The third MOA involves ASOs that sterically hinder mRNA function, often inhibiting translation. ASOs contain a variety of modifications to the sugar-phosphate backbone and bases that stabilize the ASO or render them resistant to RNase activity. RNase H-dependent ASOs include inotersen and eplontersen (for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis), fomiversen (for opportunistic cytomegalovirus infection), mipomersen (for familial hypercholesterolemia), and tofersen [for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Splice modulating ASOs include nursinersen (for spinal muscular atrophy) and eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen (all for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy). In addition, a designer ASO, milasen, was used to treat a single individual afflicted with Batten disease. Since ASO design relies principally upon knowledge of mRNA sequence, the bench to bedside pipeline for ASOs is expedient compared with protein-directed drugs. [Graphical abstract available.]."

Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium pump that actively transports calcium from the cytosol into the SR. We previously showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated SERCA2a therapy reduced cytosolic calcium overload and improved muscle and heart function in the murine DMD model. Here, we tested whether AAV SERCA2a therapy could ameliorate muscle disease in the canine DMD model. 7.83 × 10<sup>13</sup> vector genome particles of the AAV vector were injected into the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) muscles of four juvenile affected dogs. Contralateral ECU muscles received excipient. Three months later, we observed widespread transgene expression and significantly increased SERCA2a levels in the AAV-injected muscles. Treatment improved SR calcium uptake, significantly reduced calpain activity, significantly improved contractile kinetics, and significantly enhanced resistance to eccentric contraction-induced force loss. Nonetheless, muscle histology was not improved. To evaluate the safety of AAV SERCA2a therapy, we delivered the vector to the ECU muscle of adult normal dogs. We achieved strong transgene expression without altering muscle histology and function. Our results suggest that AAV SERCA2a therapy has the potential to improve muscle performance in a dystrophic large mammal."

We investigated the impact of diapocynin, a dimer of the NOX inhibitor apocynin, on the chronic disease phase of mdx<sup>5Cv</sup> mice. Treatment of these mice with diapocynin from 7 to 10 months of age resulted in decreased hypertrophy of several muscles, prevented force loss induced by tetanic and eccentric contractions, improved muscle and respiratory functions, decreased fibrosis of the diaphragm and positively regulated the expression of disease modifiers. These encouraging results ensure the potential role of diapocynin in future treatment strategies."

Due to its broad drug spectrum, dasatinib has been reported at the basic research level to improve athletic performance by eliminating senescent cell removal and to have an effect on muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but its effect on myoblasts has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of dasatinib on skeletal muscle both under normal conditions and in the regenerating state. Dasatinib suppressed the proliferation and promoted the fusion of C2C12 myoblasts. During muscle regeneration, dasatinib increased the gene expressions of myogenic-related genes (<i>Myod</i>, <i>Myog</i>, and <i>Mymx</i>), and caused abnormally thin muscle fibers on the CTX-induced muscle injury mouse model. From these results, dasatinib changes the closely regulated gene expression pattern of myogenic regulatory factors during muscle differentiation and disrupts normal muscle regeneration. Our data suggest that when using dasatinib, its effects on skeletal muscle should be considered, particularly at regenerating stages."

Following the identification of a pathogenic causative variant in the DMD gene of a proband, potential carriers can be informed of their risk of having offspring with the disease. Germline mosaicism is a variant that is confined to the gonads that can be transmitted to offspring and is usually reported when a non-carrier of a DMD pathogenic variant has two or more offspring carrying the variant in question. On average, one third of cases are the result of a de novo variant, and as DMD and BMD are prone to germline mosaicism, its inclusion in genetic counseling is mandatory. In this retrospective cohort study, we presented clinical data from an unpublished DMD/BMD cohort of 332 families with incidence of germline mosaicism in families with de novo transmission of 8.1%. This is also the first systematic literature review searching PubMed to provide an accurate assessment of the current literature on germline mosaicism in DMD and BMD, including 17 case reports and 20 original studies. The incidence of documented germline mosaicism in de novo event families ranged from 6.0 to 40%, with a mean of 8.3%. The estimated recurrence risk for mothers of a patient with a proven de novo causal variant ranged from 4.3 to 11%, with a mean of 5.8% for a male fetus. By providing an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the literature, this review aims to improve our understanding of germline mosaicism in DMD and to promote the development of effective strategies and reliable data for occurrence risk assessment in genetic counseling of de novo event families."

    "abstract": "Sarcospan (SSPN) is a 25-kDa transmembrane protein that is broadly expressed at the cell surface of many tissues, including, but not limited to, the myofibers from skeletal and smooth muscles, cardiomyocytes, adipocytes, kidney epithelial cells, and neurons. SSPN is a core component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that links the intracellular actin cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix. It is also associated with integrin α7β1, the predominant integrin expressed in skeletal muscle. As a tetraspanin-like protein with four transmembrane spanning domains, SSPN functions as a scaffold to facilitate protein-protein interactions at the cell membrane. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy are caused by the loss of dystrophin at the muscle cell surface and a concomitant loss of the entire DGC, including SSPN. SSPN overexpression ameliorates Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the <i>mdx</i> murine model, which supports SSPN being a viable therapeutic target. Other rescue studies support SSPN as a biomarker for the proper assembly and membrane expression of the DGC. Highly specific and robust antibodies to SSPN are needed for basic research on the molecular mechanisms of SSPN rescue, pre-clinical studies, and biomarker evaluations in human samples. The development of SSPN antibodies is challenged by the presence of its four transmembrane domains and limited antigenic epitopes. To address the significant barrier presented by limited commercially available antibodies, we aimed to generate a panel of robust SSPN-specific antibodies that can serve as a resource for the research community. We created antibodies to three SSPN protein epitopes, including the intracellular N- and C-termini as well as the large extracellular loop (LEL) between transmembrane domains 3 and 4. We developed a panel of rabbit antibodies (poly- and monoclonal) against an N-terminal peptide fragment of SSPN. We used several assays to show that the rabbit antibodies recognize mouse SSPN with a high functional affinity and specificity. We developed mouse monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal peptide and the large extracellular loop of human SSPN. These antibodies are superior to commercially available antibodies and outperform them in various applications, including immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescence analysis, immunoprecipitation, and an ELISA. These newly developed antibodies will significantly improve the quality and ease of SSPN detection for basic and translational research."

    "title": "Targeted Antisense Oligonucleotide-Mediated Skipping of Murine <i>Postn</i> Exon 17 Partially Addresses Fibrosis in D2.<i>mdx</i> Mice.",
    "abstract": "Periostin, a multifunctional 90 kDa protein, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis across various tissues, including skeletal muscle. It operates within the transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgf-β1) signalling pathway and is upregulated in fibrotic tissue. Alternative splicing of Periostin's C-terminal region leads to six protein-coding isoforms. This study aimed to elucidate the contribution of the isoforms containing the amino acids encoded by exon 17 (e17+ Periostin) to skeletal muscle fibrosis and investigate the therapeutic potential of manipulating exon 17 splicing. We identified distinct structural differences between e17+ Periostin isoforms, affecting their interaction with key fibrotic proteins, including Tgf-β1 and integrin alpha V. In vitro mouse fibroblast experimentation confirmed the TGF-β1-induced upregulation of e17+ Periostin mRNA, mitigated by an antisense approach that induces the skipping of exon 17 of the <i>Postn</i> gene. Subsequent in vivo studies in the D2.<i>mdx</i> mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) demonstrated that our antisense treatment effectively reduced e17+ Periostin mRNA expression, which coincided with reduced full-length Periostin protein expression and collagen accumulation. The grip strength of the treated mice was rescued to the wild-type level. These results suggest a pivotal role of e17+ Periostin isoforms in the fibrotic pathology of skeletal muscle and highlight the potential of targeted exon skipping strategies as a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating fibrosis-associated complications."

    "title": "The Role of MicroRNA in the Pathogenesis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive disorder associated with muscle wasting and degeneration. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes dystrophin, a protein that links the cytoskeleton with cell membrane proteins. The current treatment methods aim to relieve the symptoms of the disease or partially rescue muscle functionality. However, they are insufficient to suppress disease progression. In recent years, studies have uncovered an important role for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating the progression of numerous diseases. ncRNAs, such as micro-RNAs (miRNAs), bind to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to suppress translation. Understanding the mechanisms involving dysregulated miRNAs can improve diagnosis and suggest novel treatment methods for patients with DMD. This review presents the available evidence on the role of altered expression of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of DMD. We discuss the involvement of these molecules in the processes associated with muscle physiology and DMD-associated cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in maintaining the dynamic balance of intestinal epithelial and immune cells, crucial for overall organ homeostasis. Dysfunctions in these intricate relationships can lead to inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases. Recent findings uncovered the existence of a gut-muscle axis, revealing how alterations in the gut microbiota can disrupt regulatory mechanisms in muscular and adipose tissues, triggering immune-mediated inflammation. In the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), alterations in intestinal permeability stand as a potential origin of molecules that could trigger muscle degeneration via various pathways. Metabolites produced by gut bacteria, or fragments of bacteria themselves, may have the ability to migrate from the gut into the bloodstream and ultimately infiltrate distant muscle tissues, exacerbating localized pathologies. These insights highlight alternative pathological pathways in DMD beyond the musculoskeletal system, paving the way for nutraceutical supplementation as a potential adjuvant therapy. Understanding the complex interplay between the gut microbiota, immune system, and muscular health offers new perspectives for therapeutic interventions beyond conventional approaches to efficiently counteract the multifaceted nature of DMD."

An attractive therapeutic approach is autologous cell transplantation utilizing myogenic progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Given that a significant number of DMD mutations occur between exons 45 and 55, we developed a gene knock-in approach to correct any mutations downstream of exon 44. We applied this approach to two DMD patient-specific iPSC lines carrying mutations in exons 45 and 51 and confirmed mini-DYSTROPHIN (mini-DYS) protein expression in corrected myotubes by western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Transplantation of gene-edited DMD iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors into NSG/mdx<sup>4Cv</sup> mice produced donor-derived myofibers, as shown by the dual expression of human DYSTROPHIN and LAMIN A/C. These findings further provide proof-of-concept for the use of programmable nucleases for the development of autologous iPSC-based therapy for muscular dystrophies."

Molecular docking was also performed with high-activity compounds (as ligands) and target receptors (protein), and its results, together with the results of 3D-QSAR, give new insights for the design of compounds with higher biological activity.

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations. Despite recent efforts, a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated. Here, we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally, postnatally, and during lineage progression. We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem (MuSC) cell pool in extraocular muscles (EOMs) despite being, together with Myf5, a major upstream regulator during early development. Moreover, constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb. Thus, we propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. Finally, while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterised by respiratory muscle injury, inflammation, fibrosis and weakness, ultimately culminating in respiratory failure. The dystrophin-deficient mouse model of DMD (mdx) shows evidence of respiratory muscle remodelling and dysfunction contributing to impaired respiratory system performance. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects leading to improved respiratory muscle performance in a range of animal models of muscle dysfunction, including mdx mice, following short-term administration (2 weeks). We sought to build on previous work by exploring the effects of chronic NAC administration (3 months) on respiratory system performance in mdx mice. One-month-old male mdx mice were randomised to receive normal drinking water (n = 30) or 1% NAC in the drinking water (n = 30) for 3 months. At 4 months of age, we assessed breathing in conscious mice by plethysmography followed by ex vivo assessment of diaphragm force-generating capacity. Additionally, diaphragm histology was performed. In separate studies, in anaesthetised mice, respiratory electromyogram (EMG) activity and inspiratory pressure across a range of behaviours were determined, including assessment of peak inspiratory pressure-generating capacity. NAC treatment did not affect force-generating capacity of the mdx diaphragm. Collagen content and immune cell infiltration were unchanged in mdx + NAC compared with mdx diaphragms. Additionally, there was no significant effect of NAC on breathing, ventilatory responsiveness, inspiratory EMG activity or inspiratory pressure across the range of behaviours from basal conditions to peak system performance. We conclude that chronic NAC treatment has no apparent beneficial effects on respiratory system performance in the mdx mouse model of DMD suggesting limited potential of NAC treatment alone for human DMD."

Previously we revealed that dystrophic SCs express low level of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, HMOX1). Here we assess whether targeted induction of HMOX1 affect SC function and alleviates hallmark symptoms of DMD. We generated double-transgenic mouse model (mdx;HMOX1<sup>Pax7Ind</sup>) that allows tamoxifen (TX)-inducible HMOX1 expression in Pax7 positive cells of dystrophic muscles. Mdx;HMOX1<sup>Pax7Ind</sup> and control mdx mice were subjected to 5-day TX injections (75 mg/kg b.w.) followed by acute exercise protocol with high-speed treadmill (12 m/min, 45 min) and downhill running to worsen skeletal muscle phenotype and reveal immediate effects of HO-1 on muscle pathology and SC function. HMOX1 induction caused a drop in SC pool in mdx;HMOX1<sup>Pax7Ind</sup> mice (vs. mdx counterparts), while not exaggerating the effect of physical exercise. Upon physical exercise, the proliferation of SCs and activated CD34<sup>-</sup> SC subpopulation, was impaired in mdx mice, an effect that was reversed in mdx;HMOX1<sup>Pax7Ind</sup> mice, however, both in vehicle- and TX-treated animals. This corresponded to the pattern of HO-1 expression in skeletal muscles. At the tissue level, necrotic events of selective skeletal muscles of mdx mice and associated increase in circulating levels of muscle damage markers were blunted in HO-1 transgenic animals which showed also anti-inflammatory cytokine profile (vs. mdx). Targeted expression of HMOX1 plays protective role in DMD and alleviates dystrophic muscle pathology."

This was a single-centre cross-sectional study in genetically diagnosed adults with DMD (>16 years old). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors associated with dysphagia, constipation, Body Mass Index (BMI), and weight. Regression analysis explored associations between BMI, weight, and respiratory/motor abilities. We included 112 individuals (23.4 ± 5.2 years old), glucocorticoid-treated 66.1 %. The comorbidities frequency was 61.6 % scoliosis (61.0 % of them had spinal surgery), 36.6 % dysphagia, 36.6 % constipation, and 27.8 % urinary conditions. The use of glucocorticoids delayed the time to spinal surgery. The univariate analysis revealed associations between dysphagia and constipation with age, lack of glucocorticoid treatment, and lower respiratory and motor function. In the multivariate analysis, impaired cough ability remained as the factor consistently linked to both conditions. Constipation associated with lower BMI and weight. BMI and weight positively correlated with respiratory parameters, but they did not associate with functional abilities. Glucocorticoids reduce the frequency of comorbidities in adults with DMD. The ability to cough can help identifying dysphagia and constipation. Lower BMI and weight in individuals with DMD with compromised respiratory function may suggest a higher calories requirement."

Male patients 1-18 years with an <i>ICD-9/10</i> diagnosis code for hereditary progressive muscular dystrophy between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, were included.

Secondary outcomes included annual follow-up rates in other subspecialties and proportion of days covered (PDC) by corticosteroids. A total of 1,386 patients met inclusion-347 (25.0%) age 1-6 years, 502 (36.2%) age 7-12 years, and 537 (38.7%) age 13-18 years. Heart failure, respiratory failure, and technology dependence increased with age (<i>p</i> for all<0.05). The rate of neurology visits per person-year was 0.36 and did not differ by age. Corticosteroid use was low; 30% of person-years (1452/4829) had a PDC ≥20%. Medicaid insurance was independently associated with a lower likelihood of annual neurology follow-up (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.18-0.28). The rate of annual neurology follow-up and corticosteroid use in patients with DBMD is low. Medicaid insurance status was independently associated with a decreased likelihood of neurology follow-up, while age was not, suggesting that factors other than disease severity influence neurology care access. Identifying barriers to regular follow-up is critical in improving outcomes for patients with DBMD."

Given the progressive nature of the disorder with involvement of skeletal muscle, respiratory and cardiac function, perioperative care remains challenging with an increased incidence of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Perioperative care can be challenging due to life-threatening perioperative adverse events related to associated end-organ effects, as well as sensitivity to various anesthetic agents, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, and cardiac arrest. We present a 22-year-old DMD patient with left ventricular assisted device (LVAD), who presented for repair of both left distal femur and tibial diaphysis fractures. Anesthetic care included the unique combination of total intravenous anesthesia with dexmedetomidine and remimazolam combined with regional anesthesia including a supra-inguinal fascia iliaca block, saphenous nerve block, and popliteal nerve block.

    "abstract": "Alterations in Dp71 expression, the most ubiquitous dystrophin isoform, have been associated with patient survival across tumours. Intriguingly, in certain malignancies, Dp71 acts as a tumour suppressor, while manifesting oncogenic properties in others. This diversity could be explained by the expression of two Dp71 splice variants encoding proteins with distinct C-termini, each with specific properties. Expression of these variants has impeded the exploration of their unique roles. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we ablated the Dp71f variant with the alternative C-terminus in a sarcoma cell line not expressing the canonical C-terminal variant, and conducted molecular (RNAseq) and functional characterisation of the knockout cells. Dp71f ablation induced major transcriptomic alterations, particularly affecting the expression of genes involved in calcium signalling and ECM-receptor interaction pathways. The genome-scale metabolic analysis identified significant downregulation of glucose transport via membrane vesicle reaction (GLCter) and downregulated glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. Functionally, these molecular changes corresponded with, increased calcium responses, cell adhesion, proliferation, survival under serum starvation and chemotherapeutic resistance. Knockout cells showed reduced GLUT1 protein expression, survival without attachment and their migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo were unaltered, despite increased matrix metalloproteinases release. Our findings emphasise the importance of alternative splicing of dystrophin transcripts and underscore the role of the Dp71f variant, which appears to govern distinct cellular processes frequently dysregulated in tumour cells. The loss of this regulatory mechanism promotes sarcoma cell survival and treatment resistance. Thus, Dp71f is a target for future investigations exploring the intricate functions of specific DMD transcripts in physiology and across malignancies."

Five hundred ninety-five patients were investigated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and 54 patients were examined by sequencing. Deletion was detected in 60% (132/220) of the cases in the mPCR group only and in 58.3% (347/595) of the cases with MLPA analysis.

The introns 43-55 (81.8%) and exons 2-21 (13.1%) regions were detected as hot spots in deletions. It was determined that 89% of the mutations were suitable for exon skipping therapy. The reading frame rule did not hold in 7.6% of D/BMD cases (17/224). We detected twenty-five pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in sequencing, five of which were novel variants. Nonsense mutation was the most common small mutation (44%). 21% of DMD patients were familial. We detected germline mosaicism in four families (4.3%) in the large rearrangement group and one gonosomal mosaicism in a family with a nonsense mutation. This is the largest study examining genotype and phenotype data in Turkish D/BMD families investigated by MLPA analysis. The reading frame hypothesis is not valid in all cases. Sharing the genotype and phenotype characteristics of these cases in the literature will shed light on the molecular structure of DMD and guide gene therapy research. In genetic counseling, carrier screening in the family and possible gonadal mosaicism should be emphasized."

Here, we studied the impact of estrogen depletion (via ovariectomy) on exercise tolerance and muscle mitochondrial metabolism in female mdx mice and the potential of estrogen replacement therapy (using estradiol) to protect against functional and metabolic perturbations. We also investigated the effect of estrogen depletion, and replacement, on the skeletal muscle proteome through an untargeted proteomic approach with TMT-labelling. Our study confirms that loss of estrogen in female mdx mice reduces exercise capacity, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and citrate synthase activity but that these deficits are offset through estrogen replacement therapy. Furthermore, ovariectomy downregulated protein expression of RNA-binding motif factor 20 (Rbm20), a critical regulator of sarcomeric and muscle homeostasis gene splicing, which impacted pathways involving ribosomal and mitochondrial translation. Estrogen replacement modulated Rbm20 protein expression and promoted metabolic processes and the upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism. Our data suggest that estrogen mitigates dystrophinopathic features in female mdx mice and that estrogen replacement may be a potential therapy for post-menopausal DMD carriers."

A retrospective analysis of longitudinal clinical visit data from 137 glucocorticoid-treated patients with DMD collected via structured motor assessment protocol evaluated associations between ALMI and motor function indexed by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and 10 Meter Walk/run Test (10MWT). Body composition was assessed using DXA. ALMI was calculated by dividing arm and leg lean mass by height in m<sup>2</sup>; fat mass index (FMI) was calculated by dividing whole body fat mass by height in m<sup>2</sup>. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations between ALMI and motor function, controlling for age and FMI.

Next to dystrophin expression in the muscle, different isoforms of the protein are also expressed in the brain and lack of these isoforms leads to cognitive and behavioral deficits in patients. It remains unclear how the loss of the shorter dystrophin isoform Dp140 affects these processes. Using a variety of behavioral tests, we found that mdx and mdx<sup>4cv</sup> mice (which lack Dp427 or Dp427 + Dp140, respectively) exhibit similar deficits in working memory, movement patterns and blood-brain barrier integrity. Neither model showed deficits in spatial learning and memory, learning flexibility, anxiety or spontaneous behavior, nor did we observe differences in aquaporin 4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein.

Weakness extends to the respiratory musculature, and cardiorespiratory failure is the leading cause of death in men with DMD. Intermittent hypoxia has emerged as a potential therapy to counteract ventilatory insufficiency by eliciting long-term facilitation of breathing. Mechanisms of sensory and motor facilitation of breathing have been well delineated in animal models. Various paradigms of intermittent hypoxia have been designed and implemented in human trials culminating in clinical trials in people with spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Application of therapeutic intermittent hypoxia to DMD is considered together with discussion of the potential barriers to progression owing to the complexity of this devastating disease. Notwithstanding the considerable challenges and potential pitfalls of intermittent hypoxia-based therapies for DMD, we suggest it is incumbent on the research community to explore the potential benefits in pre-clinical models. Intermittent hypoxia paradigms should be implemented to explore the proclivity to express respiratory plasticity with the longer-term aim of preserving and potentiating ventilation in pre-clinical models and people with DMD."

More than half of patients experienced clinically significant deficits in FVC %-predicted and PUL 1.2 before experiencing LoA. Among subjects with baseline 10MWR >10 s, those with <1 year to LoA had similar mean ages but significantly worse mean ambulatory function at baseline compared to those with ≥1 year to LoA. Enriching DMD clinical trials for patients with declining pulmonary or upper limb function is achievable without restricting enrollment to non-ambulatory patients. The sequencing of LoA and initial deficits in pulmonary and upper limb function varied across patients and highlights the potential for composite outcomes or multi-outcome trial designs to assess disease-modifying therapies more comprehensively."

    "title": "Two operational modes of atomic force microscopy reveal similar mechanical properties for homologous regions of dystrophin and utrophin.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle disease caused by the absence of the protein dystrophin. Dystrophin is hypothesized to work as a molecular shock absorber that limits myofiber membrane damage when undergoing reversible unfolding upon muscle stretching and contraction. Utrophin is a dystrophin homologue that is under investigation as a protein replacement therapy for DMD. However, it remains uncertain whether utrophin can mechanically substitute for dystrophin. Here, we compared the mechanical properties of homologous utrophin and dystrophin fragments encoding the N terminus through spectrin repeat 3 (UtrN-R3, DysN-R3) using two operational modes of atomic force microscopy (AFM), constant speed and constant force. Our comprehensive data, including the statistics of force magnitude at which the folded domains unfold in constant speed mode and the time of unfolding statistics in constant force mode, show consistent results. We recover parameters of the energy landscape of the domains and conducted Monte Carlo simulations which corroborate the conclusions drawn from experimental data. Our results confirm that UtrN-R3 expressed in bacteria exhibits significantly lower mechanical stiffness compared to insect UtrN-R3, while the mechanical stiffness of the homologous region of dystrophin (DysN-R3) is intermediate between bacterial and insect UtrN-R3, showing greater similarity to bacterial UtrN-R3."

    "abstract": "Due to improved supportive care, survival of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has increased significantly. Consequently, new challenges emerge in adult patients with DMD. In clinical practice we increasingly see patients with serious, even life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) problems in advanced disease stages. Little is known about the longitudinal course of GI problems and the appropriate management. We present a case-series of six adult patients with DMD with (recurrent) GI problems that required hospital admission. The most prevalent reported serious GI symptoms were gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction, (sub)ileus and gastric dilatation. Besides, an overview is presented of the therapeutic options for GI problems in DMD. The current study provides insight in possible treatment options, however, there is a clear need for more research and an integral guideline on treatment of GI problems in adult patients with DMD in order to reduce associated morbidity and mortality."

The cross-sectional study included children aged 5-18 years and diagnosed with DMD and their families. Data were collected using the Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Scoring System (DVISS), the Barthel Index, and the Pediatric Quality of Life™ 3.0 Neuromuscular Module (PedsQL-NMM). The study was completed with 45 children with DMD. LUTS was found in 86.66% and LUTD was found in 44.44%. The most common symptom was holding maneuvers (62.22%). Other common symptoms were urinary urgency (55.55%), daytime urinary incontinence (46.66%), and enuresis (31.11%). There was a significant correlation of the DVISS with the level of independence and QoL (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher LUTS score was associated with lower Barthel and PedsQL-NMM scores. LUTS is a neglected condition, although it is frequently seen in children with DMD. NCT05464446."

This study aimed to investigate the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) in diagnosing muscular disorders in pediatric patients in Taiwan. Out of 161 pediatric patients suspected to have genetic/inherited myopathies, 115 received a molecular diagnosis through conventional tests, single gene testing, and gene panels. The remaining 46 patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-negative Duchenne muscular dystrophy) with three patients (6.5%), Group 2 (various forms of muscular dystrophies) with 21 patients (45.7%), and Group 3 (congenital myopathies) with 22 patients (47.8%). WES analysis of these groups found pathogenic variants in 100.0% (3/3), 57.1% (12/21), and 68.2% (15/22) of patients in Groups 1 to 3, respectively. WES had a diagnostic yield of 65.2% (30 patients out of 46), detecting 30 pathogenic or potentially pathogenic variants across 28 genes. WES enables the diagnosis of rare diseases with symptoms and characteristics similar to congenital myopathies and muscular dystrophies, such as muscle weakness. Consequently, this approach facilitates targeted therapy implementation and appropriate genetic counseling."

This study aimed to assess the impact of a 14-day ketogenic diet (DCet) on biochemical and clinical parameters in a DMD mouse model. Young adult mice (50 days old) were fed DCet, while control groups received a standard diet. On the 14th day, memory and behavior tests were conducted, followed by biochemical evaluations of oxidative stress, inflammatory biomarkers, body weight, feed intake, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. mdx + DCet mice showed reduced mass (0.2 g ± 2.49) and improved memory retention (p < 0.05) compared to controls. Oxidative damage in muscle tissue and CNS decreased, along with a significant cytokine level reduction (p <0.05). The protocol led to an increase in hippocampal BDNF and mitochondrial respiratory complex activity in muscle tissue and the central nervous system (CNS), while also decreasing creatine kinase activity only in the striatum. Overall, a 14-day DCet showed protective effects by improving spatial learning and memory through reductions in oxidative stress and immune response, as well as increases in BDNF levels, consistent with our study's findings."

    "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies are a devastating class of diseases that result in a progressive loss of muscle integrity. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the most prevalent form of Muscular Dystrophy, is due to the loss of functional Dystrophin. While much is known regarding destruction of muscle tissue in these diseases, much less is known regarding the synaptic defects that also occur in these diseases. Synaptic defects are also among the earliest hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, including the neuromuscular disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Our current study investigates synaptic defects within adult muscle tissues as well as presynaptic motor neurons in Drosophila <i>dystrophin</i> mutants. Here we demonstrate that the progressive, age-dependent loss of flight ability in <i>dystrophin</i> mutants is accompanied by disorganization of Neuromuscular Junctions (NMJs), including impaired localization of both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. We show that these synaptic defects, including presynaptic defects within motor neurons, are due to the loss of Dystrophin specifically within muscles. These results should help to better understand the early synaptic defects preceding cell loss in neuromuscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Dystrophin Dp71 is the major product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene in the brain, and its loss in DMD patients and mouse models leads to cognitive impairments. Dp71 is expressed as a range of proteins generated by alternative splicing of exons 71 to 74 and 78, classified in the main Dp71d and Dp71f groups that contain specific C-terminal ends. However, it is unknown whether each isoform has a specific role in distinct cell types, brain regions, and/or stages of brain development. In the present study, we characterized the expression of Dp71 isoforms during fetal (E10.5, E15.5) and postnatal (P1, P7, P14, P21 and P60) mouse and rat brain development. We finely quantified the expression of several Dp71 transcripts by RT-PCR and cloning assays in samples from whole-brain and distinct brain structures. The following Dp71 transcripts were detected: Dp71d, Dp71d<sub>∆71</sub>, Dp71d<sub>∆74</sub>, Dp71d<sub>∆71,74</sub>, Dp71d<sub>∆71-74</sub>, Dp71f, Dp71f<sub>∆71</sub>, Dp71f<sub>∆74</sub>, Dp71f<sub>∆71,74</sub>, and Dp71f<sub>Δ71-74</sub>. We found that the Dp71f isoform is the main transcript expressed at E10.5 (> 80%), while its expression is then progressively reduced and replaced by the expression of isoforms of the Dp71d group from E15.5 to postnatal and adult ages. This major finding was confirmed by third-generation nanopore sequencing. In addition, we found that the level of expression of specific Dp71 isoforms varies as a function of postnatal stages and brain structure. Our results suggest that Dp71 isoforms have different and complementary roles during embryonic and postnatal brain development, likely taking part in a variety of maturation processes in distinct cell types."

To establish the relationship between hand strength and function, and to determine the strength threshold that differentiates normal and abnormal hand function in individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) or Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Maximal handgrip and key pinch strength were measured with the MyoGrip and MyoPinch dynamometers, respectively. Hand function was assessed using the MoviPlate, the Motor Function Measure items for distal upper limb (MFM-D3-UL) and the Cochin Hand Function Scale (CHFS). Data from 168 participants (91 DMD and 77 SMA, age 6-31 years) were analyzed. Relationships between strength and function were significant (P < 0.001). Hand function was generally preserved when strength was above the strength threshold determined by Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis: For MFM-D3-UL, the calculated handgrip strength thresholds were 41 and 13% of the predicted strength for a healthy subject (% pred) and the key pinch strength thresholds were 42 and 26% pred for DMD and SMA, respectively. For the MoviPlate, handgrip strength thresholds were 11 and 8% pred and key pinch strength thresholds were 21 and 11% pred for DMD and SMA, respectively. For participants with sub-threshold strength, hand function scores decreased with decreasing strength. At equal % pred strength, individuals with SMA had better functional scores than those with DMD. Hand function is strength-dependent for most motor tasks. It declines only when strength falls below a disease-specific threshold. Therefore, therapies capable of maintaining strength above this threshold should preserve hand function."

    "abstract": "In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein have emerged as a revolutionary gene editing tool to treat inherited disorders affecting different organ systems, such as blood and muscles. Both hematological and neuromuscular genetic disorders benefit from genome editing approaches but face different challenges in their clinical translation. The ability of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to modify hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo has greatly accelerated the development of genetic therapies for blood disorders. In the last decade, many clinical trials were initiated and are now delivering encouraging results. The recent FDA approval of Casgevy, the first CRISPR/Cas9-based drug for severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, represents a significant milestone in the field and highlights the great potential of this technology. Similar preclinical efforts are currently expanding CRISPR therapies to other hematologic disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies. In the neuromuscular field, the versatility of CRISPR/Cas9 has been instrumental for the generation of new cellular and animal models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), offering innovative platforms to speed up preclinical development of therapeutic solutions. Several corrective interventions have been proposed to genetically restore dystrophin production using the CRISPR toolbox and have demonstrated promising results in different DMD animal models. Although these advances represent a significant step forward to the clinical translation of CRISPR/Cas9 therapies to DMD, there are still many hurdles to overcome, such as in vivo delivery methods associated with high viral vector doses, together with safety and immunological concerns. Collectively, the results obtained in the hematological and neuromuscular fields emphasize the transformative impact of CRISPR/Cas9 for patients affected by these debilitating conditions. As each field suffers from different and specific challenges, the clinical translation of CRISPR therapies may progress differentially depending on the genetic disorder. Ongoing investigations and clinical trials will address risks and limitations of these therapies, including long-term efficacy, potential genotoxicity, and adverse immune reactions. This review provides insights into the diverse applications of CRISPR-based technologies in both preclinical and clinical settings for monogenic blood disorders and muscular dystrophy and compare advances in both fields while highlighting current trends, difficulties, and challenges to overcome."

This new approach offers therapeutic potential for the treatment of various diseases, including inherited disorders. The ongoing studies on chimeric cells prompted the development of Dystrophin-Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cells which were introduced as a potential therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a genetic condition that leads to premature death in adolescent boys and remains incurable with current methods. DEC therapy, created via the fusion of human myoblasts derived from normal and DMD-affected donors, has proven to be safe and efficacious when tested in experimental models of DMD after systemic-intraosseous administration. These studies confirmed increased dystrophin expression, which correlated with functional and morphological improvements in DMD-affected muscles, including cardiac, respiratory, and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, the application of DEC therapy in a clinical study confirmed its long-term safety and efficacy in DMD patients. This review summarizes the development of chimeric cell technology tested in preclinical models and clinical studies, highlighting the potential of DEC therapy in muscle regeneration and repair, and introduces chimeric cell-based therapies as a promising, novel approach for muscle regeneration and the treatment of DMD and other neuromuscular disorders."

Despite these advances, at any point errors can occur leading to misdiagnosis or a missed diagnosis. In some instances, the missed information can lead to the birth of a child with health issues where short of the error, the decision to avoid conception or terminate the pregnancy might have been made. When these lapses unfold, there exists the potential for a wrongful birth or wrongful life lawsuit to ensue. While these 2 actions are based on the same set of events, they are distinct legal claims with varying degrees of judicial permissibility. Global legal acceptability of wrongful birth and life lawsuits tends to resemble patterns in the United States. Analyzing prior wrongful birth and wrongful life claims can reveal common trends in events leading to these types of lawsuits, as well as an understanding of their potential outcomes. A familiarity with wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits demonstrates how these cases are unique from other forms of prenatal or birth injury tort lawsuits and can provide insights to common shortcomings in clinical practice. Applying these lessons to clinical practice highlights key approaches towards limiting the risk of certain errors leading to wrongful birth and wrongful life lawsuits, with the goal of health-care providers offering high quality health care."

Dystrophin deficiency leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle atrophy. Boys with DMD have progressive muscle weakness within the diaphragm that results in respiratory failure in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life. The most common DMD mouse model - the mdx mouse - is not sufficient for evaluating genetic medicines that specifically target the human DMD (hDMD) gene sequence. Therefore, a novel transgenic mouse carrying the hDMD gene with an exon 52 deletion was created (hDMDΔ52;mdx). We characterized the respiratory function and pathology in this model using whole body plethysmography, histology, and immunohistochemistry. At 6-months-old, hDMDΔ52;mdx mice have reduced maximal respiration, neuromuscular junction pathology, and fibrosis throughout the diaphragm, which worsens at 12-months-old. In conclusion, the hDMDΔ52;mdx exhibits moderate respiratory pathology, and serves as a relevant animal model to study the impact of novel genetic therapies, including gene editing, on respiratory function."

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a central role in muscle metabolism and function. A unique family of iron-sulfur proteins, termed CDGSH Iron Sulfur Domain-containing (CISD/NEET) proteins, support mitochondrial function in skeletal muscles. The abundance of these proteins declines during aging leading to muscle degeneration. Although the function of the outer mitochondrial CISD/NEET proteins, CISD1/mitoNEET and CISD2/NAF-1, has been defined in skeletal muscle cells, the role of the inner mitochondrial CISD protein, CISD3/MiNT, is currently unknown. Here, we show that CISD3 deficiency in mice results in muscle atrophy that shares proteomic features with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We further reveal that CISD3 deficiency impairs the function and structure of skeletal muscles, as well as their mitochondria, and that CISD3 interacts with, and donates its [2Fe-2S] clusters to, complex I respiratory chain subunit NADH Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit V2 (NDUFV2). Using coevolutionary and structural computational tools, we model a CISD3-NDUFV2 complex with proximal coevolving residue interactions conducive of [2Fe-2S] cluster transfer reactions, placing the clusters of the two proteins 10 to 16 Å apart. Taken together, our findings reveal that CISD3/MiNT is important for supporting the biogenesis and function of complex I, essential for muscle maintenance and function. Interventions that target CISD3 could therefore impact different muscle degeneration syndromes, aging, and related conditions."

Then, we assessed the relationships between illness time, cytokine levels, and nutritional status. Forty-four male participants, aged 4.3-24.2 years, were evaluated. Concerning nutritional status, 18 participants were eutrophic. The fat mass increased and the lean mass decreased from the beginning of the first signs of DMD. Cytokines levels in DMD patients, even under corticosteroids therapy, are higher than values described in the literature on healthy subjects. The regression models demonstrated that illness time and BMI/A z-scores are associated with higher values of interleukin-6. A persistent inflammatory profile was observed in the patients evaluated. The data suggest that maintaining adequate nutritional status and body composition is important for determining the inflammation presented by individuals with DMD."

    "abstract": "Composed of a diverse variety of cells, the skeletal muscle is one of the body's tissues with the remarkable ability to regenerate after injury. One of the key players in the regeneration process is the muscle satellite cell (MuSC), a stem cell population for skeletal muscle, as it is the source of new myofibers. Maintaining MuSC quiescence during homeostasis involves complex interactions between MuSCs and other cells in their corresponding niche in adult skeletal muscle. After the injury, MuSCs are activated to enter the cell cycle for cell proliferation and differentiate into myotubes, followed by mature myofibers to regenerate muscle. Despite decades of research, the exact mechanisms underlying MuSC maintenance and activation remain elusive. Traditional methods of analyzing MuSCs, including cell cultures, animal models, and gene expression analyses, provide some insight into MuSC biology but lack the ability to replicate the 3-dimensional (3-D) <i>in vivo</i> muscle environment and capture dynamic processes comprehensively. Recent advancements in imaging technology, including confocal, intra-vital, and multi-photon microscopies, provide promising avenues for dynamic MuSC morphology and behavior to be observed and characterized. This chapter aims to review 3-D and live-imaging methods that have contributed to uncovering insights into MuSC behavior, morphology changes, interactions within the muscle niche, and internal signaling pathways during the quiescence to activation (Q-A) transition. Integrating advanced imaging modalities and computational tools provides a new avenue for studying complex biological processes in skeletal muscle regeneration and muscle degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)."

We sought to understand the barriers faced by Hispanic/Latino families specifically and underrepresented groups more generally to clinical trial participation in Duchenne. We engaged two participant groups: Hispanic/Latino caregivers of children with Duchenne in the US, including Puerto Rico, and health professionals within the broader US Duchenne community. Caregiver interviews explored attitudes towards and experiences with clinical trials, while professional interviews explored barriers to clinical trial participation among socio-demographically underrepresented families (e.g., low income, rural, racial/ethnic minority, etc.). Interviews were analyzed aggregately and using a thematic analysis approach. An advisory group was engaged throughout the course of the study to inform design, conduct, and interpretation of findings generated from interviews. Thirty interviews were conducted, including with 12 Hispanic/Latina caregivers and 18 professionals. We identified barriers to clinical trial participation at various stages of the enrollment process. In the initial identification of patients, barriers included lack of awareness about trials and clinical trial locations at clinics that were less likely to serve diverse patients. In the prescreening process, barriers included ineligibility, anticipated non-compliance in clinical trial protocols, and language discrimination. In screening, barriers included concerns about characteristics of the trial, as well as mistrust/lack of trust. In consent and recruitment, barriers included lack of timely decision support, logistical factors (distance, time, money), and lack of translated study materials. Numerous barriers hinder participation in Duchenne clinical trials for Hispanic/Latino families and other populations experiencing health disparities. Addressing these barriers necessitates interventions across multiple stages of the clinical trial enrollment process. Recommendations to enhance participation opportunities include developing clinical trial decision support tools, translating prominent clinical trials educational resources such as ClinicalTrials.gov, fostering trusting family-provider relationships, engaging families in clinical trial design, and establishing ethical guidelines for pre-screening potentially non-compliant patients."

Herein, we report the design and synthesis of novel quinazoline and quinoline-based small molecules as potent utrophin modulators screened via high throughput In-Cell ELISA in C2C12 cells. Remarkably, lead molecule SG-02, identified from a library of 70 molecules, upregulates utrophin 2.7-fold at 800 nM in a dose-dependent manner, marking the highest upregulation within the nanomolar range. SG-02's efficacy was further validated through DMD patient-derived cells, demonstrating a significant 2.3-fold utrophin expression. Mechanistically, SG-02 functions as an AhR antagonist, with excellent binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 41.68 nM). SG-02 also enhances myogenesis, as indicated by an increased MyHC expression. ADME evaluation supports SG-02's oral bioavailability. Overall, SG-02 holds promise for addressing the global DMD population."

    "title": "The glucocorticoid receptor acts locally to protect dystrophic muscle and heart during disease.",
    "abstract": "Absence of dystrophin results in muscular weakness, chronic inflammation and cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Pharmacological corticosteroids are the DMD standard of care; however, they have harsh side effects and unclear molecular benefits. It is uncertain whether signaling by physiological corticosteroids and their receptors plays a modifying role in the natural etiology of DMD. Here, we knocked out the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, encoded by Nr3c1) specifically in myofibers and cardiomyocytes within wild-type and mdx52 mice to dissect its role in muscular dystrophy. Double-knockout mice showed significantly worse phenotypes than mdx52 littermate controls in measures of grip strength, hang time, inflammatory pathology and gene expression. In the heart, GR deletion acted additively with dystrophin loss to exacerbate cardiomyopathy, resulting in enlarged hearts, pathological gene expression and systolic dysfunction, consistent with imbalanced mineralocorticoid signaling. The results show that physiological GR functions provide a protective role during muscular dystrophy, directly contrasting its degenerative role in other disease states. These data provide new insights into corticosteroids in disease pathophysiology and establish a new model to investigate cell-autonomous roles of nuclear receptors and mechanisms of pharmacological corticosteroids."

    "abstract": "Gene and RNA therapies are promising treatments for many rare diseases. Pediatric populations that could benefit from these drugs are overrepresented among state Medicaid programs. Using Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data, we examined Medicaid spending and utilization of rare disease gene and RNA therapies. Between 2017 and 2022, the number of available gene and RNA therapies increased from 3 to 13, yearly Medicaid spending increased from $148.3 million to $879.7 million, and the number of yearly treatments (a proxy for number of patients) increased from 327 to 1638. Nearly all spending was attributed to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy drugs. States participating in Medicaid pooled purchasing initiatives had 39% higher treatments per 100 000 enrollees with no differences in spending. Compared to states without a carve-out, states that carved SMA drugs out of managed Medicaid contracts had higher utilization (54%). Spending among carve-out states varied according to managed care enrollment, being higher for those with <80% of enrollees in managed care as compared with those with ≥80% of enrollees in managed care. This suggests that multi-state purchasing initiatives and managed care carve-outs can help increase access to gene and RNA therapies among Medicaid beneficiaries, but it is unclear if these strategies are effective at managing spending."

    "abstract": "Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) is an important precursor for intracellular choline supply in phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism. GDE5/Gpcpd1 hydrolyzes GPC into choline and glycerol 3-phosphate; this study aimed to elucidate its physiological function in vivo. Heterozygous whole-body GDE5-deficient mice reveal a significant GPC accumulation across tissues, while homozygous whole-body knockout results in embryonic lethality. Skeletal muscle-specific GDE5 deletion (Gde5 skKO) exhibits reduced passive force and improved fatigue resistance in electrically stimulated gastrocnemius muscles in vivo. GDE5 deficiency also results in higher glycolytic metabolites and glycogen levels, and glycerophospholipids alteration, including reduced levels of phospholipids that bind polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as DHA. Interestingly, this PC fatty acid compositional change is similar to that observed in skeletal muscles of denervated and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. These are accompanied by decrease of GDE5 expression, suggesting a regulatory role of GDE5 activity for glycerophospholipid profiles. Furthermore, a DHA-rich diet enhances contractile force and lowers fatigue resistance, suggesting a functional relationship between PC fatty acid composition and muscle function. Finally, skinned fiber experiments show that GDE5 loss increases the probability of the ryanodine receptor opening and lowers the maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force. Collectively, GDE5 activity plays roles in PC and glucose/glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal X-linked recessive genetic disease, is characterized by progressive muscle wasting which will lead to premature death by cardiorespiratory complications in their late twenties. And 2.5-19% DMD carriers that also suffer from skeletal muscle damage or dilated cardiomyopathy when diagnosed as soon as possible is meaningful for prenatal diagnosis and advance warning for self-health. The current DMD carrier screening mainly relies on detecting serum creatine kinase activity, covering only 50-70% DMD carriers which will cause many false negatives and require the discovery of highly effective biomarker and simple detection procedure for DMD carriers. In this article, we have compiled a comprehensive summary of all documented biomarkers associated with DMD and categorized them based on their expression patterns. We specifically pinpointed novel DMD biomarkers, previously unreported in DMD carriers, and conducted further investigations to explore their potential. Compared to creatine kinase activity alone in DMD carriers, creatine kinase-MM can improve the specificity from 73 to 81%. And our investigation revealed another promising protein: proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor (RET). When combined with creatine kinase-MM (creatine kinase-MM/RET ratio), it significantly enhances the specificity (from 81 to 83%) and sensitivity (from 71.4 to 93%) of detecting DMD carriers in serum. Moreover, we successfully devised an efficient method for extracting RET from dried blood spots. This breakthrough allowed us to detect both creatine kinase-MM and RET using dried blood spots without compromising the detection rate."

This study aims to identify the hub genes unrelated to excessive immune response but responsible for DMD progression and explore therapeutic siRNAs, thereby providing a novel treatment. Top ten hub genes for DMD were identified from GSE38417 dataset by using GEO2R and PPI networks based on Cytoscape analysis. The hub genes unrelated to excessive immune response were identified by GeneCards, and their expression was further verified in mdx and C57 mice at 2 and 4 months (M) by (RT-q) PCR and western blotting. Therapeutic siRNAs were deemed as those that could normalize the expression of the validated hub genes in transfected C2C12 cells. 855 up-regulated and 324 down-regulated DEGs were screened from GSE38417 dataset. Five of the top 10 hub genes were considered as the candidate genes unrelated to excessive immune response, and three of these candidates were consistently and significantly up-regulated in mdx mice at 2 M and 4 M when compared with age-matched C57 mice, including Col1a2, Fbn1 and Fn1. Furthermore, the three validated up-regulated candidate genes can be significantly down-regulated by three rational designed siRNA (p < 0.0001), respectively. COL1A2, FBN1 and FN1 may be novel biomarkers for DMD, and the siRNAs designed in our study were help to develop adjunctive therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by loss-of-function mutations in the dystrophin gene, results in progressive muscle weakness and early fatality. Impaired autophagy is one of the cellular hallmarks of DMD, contributing to the disease progression. Molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of autophagy in DMD are not well understood. In the current study, the DMD mouse model mdx was used for the investigation of signaling pathways leading to suppression of autophagy. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was hyperactive in the DMD muscles, accompanying muscle weakness and autophagy impairment. Surprisingly, Akt, a well-known upstream regulator of mTORC1, was not responsible for mTORC1 activation or the dystrophic muscle phenotypes. Instead, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) was overexpressed in mdx muscles compared with the wild type. LeuRS activates mTORC1 in a noncanonical mechanism that involves interaction with RagD, an activator of mTORC1. Disrupting LeuRS interaction with RagD by the small-molecule inhibitor BC-LI-0186 reduced mTORC1 activity, restored autophagy, and ameliorated myofiber damage in the mdx muscles. Furthermore, inhibition of LeuRS by BC-LI-0186 improved dystrophic muscle strength in an autophagy-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings uncovered a noncanonical function of the housekeeping protein LeuRS as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of DMD."

    "abstract": "Gait analysis serves as a critical diagnostic tool for identifying neurologic and musculoskeletal damage. Traditional manual analysis of motion data, however, is labor-intensive and heavily reliant on the expertise and judgment of the therapist. This study introduces a binary classification method for the quantitative assessment of gait impairments, specifically focusing on Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a prevalent and fatal neuromuscular genetic disorder. The research compares spatiotemporal and sagittal kinematic gait features derived from 2D and 3D human pose estimation trajectories against concurrently recorded 3D motion capture (MoCap) data from healthy children. The proposed model leverages a novel benchmark dataset, collected from YouTube and publicly available datasets of their typically developed peers, to extract time-distance variables (e.g. speed, step length, stride time, and cadence) and sagittal joint angles of the lower extremity (e.g. hip, knee, and knee flexion angles). Machine learning and deep learning techniques are employed to discern patterns that can identify children exhibiting DMD gait disturbances. While the current model is capable of distinguishing between healthy subjects and those with DMD, it does not specifically differentiate between DMD patients and patients with other gait impairments. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our cost-effective method, which relies on recorded RGB video, in detecting gait abnormalities, achieving a prediction accuracy of 96.2% for Support Vector Machine (SVM) and 97% for the deep network."

    "abstract": "Inherited neuromuscular disorder (IND) is a broad-spectrum, clinically diverse group of diseases that are caused due to defects in the neurosystem, muscles and related tissue. Since IND may originate from mutations in hundreds of different genes, the resulting heterogeneity of IND is a great challenge for accurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Three pediatric cases with IND were enrolled in the present study and subjected to a thorough clinical examination. Next, a genetic investigation was conducted using whole-exome sequencing (WES). The suspected variants were validated through Sanger sequencing or quantitative fluorescence PCR assay. A new missense variant of the Spastin (<i>SPAST</i>) gene was found and analyzed at the structural level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All three cases presented with respective specific clinical manifestations, which reflected the diversity of IND. WES detected the diagnostic variants in all 3 cases: A compound variation comprising collagen type VI α3 chain (<i>COL6A3</i>) (NM_004369; exon19):c.6322G>T(p.E1208*) and a one-copy loss of COL6A3:exon19 in Case 1, which are being reported for the first time; a <i>de novo SPAST</i> (NM_014946; exon8):c.1166C>A(p.T389K) variant in Case 2; and a <i>de novo</i> Duchenne muscular dystrophy (NM_004006; exon11):c.1150-17_1160delACTTCCTTCTTTGTCAGGGGTACATGATinsC variant in Case 3. The structural and MD analyses revealed that the detected novel <i>SPAST</i>: c.1166C>A(p.T389K) variant mainly altered the intramolecular hydrogen bonding status and the protein segment's secondary structure. In conclusion, the present study expanded the IND mutation spectrum. The study not only detailed the precise diagnoses of these cases but also furnished substantial grounds for informed consultations. The approach involving the genetic evaluation strategy using WES for variation screening followed by validation using appropriate methods is beneficial due to the considerable heterogeneity of IND."

We conducted a longitudinal prospective study to evaluate pNF-H levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of 29 individuals with childhood-onset SMA treated with Nuinersen (SMA type 1: <i>n</i> = 6, 2: <i>n</i> = 17, 3: <i>n</i> = 6). pNF-H levels before and during treatment were compared with the levels of controls (<i>n</i> = 22), patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<i>n</i> = 17), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (<i>n</i> = 11), untreated SMA individuals with chronic type 3 disease (<i>n</i> = 8), and children with presymptomatic SMA (<i>n</i> = 3). SMA type 1 showed the highest mean CSF pNF-H levels before treatment initiation. All Nusinersen-treated individuals (types 1, 2, and 3) showed significantly elevated mean baseline CSF pNF-H compared to controls, which inversely correlated with age at disease onset, age at first dose, disease duration and the initial CHOP INTEND result (SMA type 1 and 2). During 22 months of treatment, CSF pNF-H levels declined during loading doses, stabilizing at reduced levels from the initial maintenance dose in all individuals. Baseline plasma pNF-H levels in type 1 and 2 SMA were significantly increased compared to other cohorts and decreased notably in type 1 after 2 months of treatment and type 2 after 14 months. Conversely, SMA type 3, characterized by lower baseline pNF-H levels, did not show significant fluctuations in plasma pNF-H levels after 14 months of treatment. Our findings suggest that CSF pNF-H levels in untreated SMA individuals are significantly higher than in controls and that monitoring of CSF pNF-H levels may serve as an indicator of rapid short-term treatment response in childhood-onset SMA individuals, irrespective of the subtype of the disease, while also suggesting its potential for assessing long-term suppression of neurodegeneration. Plasma pNF-H may serve as an appropriate outcome measure for disease progression and/or response to treatment in types 1 and 2 but not in type 3. Presymptomatic infants with SMA may show elevated pNF-H levels, confirming early neuronal degeneration."

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether scores from remote functional assessment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy correspond to in-person scores on the same functional assessments. Remote live stream versus in-person scores on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (including time [seconds] to complete the 10-meter walk/run and time to rise from the floor [supine to stand]) were assessed using statistical analyses, including intraclass correlation coefficient, and Pearson, Spearman, and Bland-Altman analyses. The remote and in-clinic assessments had to occur within 2 weeks of one another to be considered for this analysis. This analysis included patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, aged 4 to 7 years. Participants in this analysis received delandistrogene moxeparvovec (as part of SRP-9001-101 [Study 101; NCT03375164] or SRP-9001-102 [Study 102; NCT03769116]) or were randomized to receive placebo (in Part 1 of Study 102). This study evaluates score reproducibility between live stream remote scoring versus in-person functional assessments as determined by intraclass correlation coefficient, and Pearson, Spearman, and Bland-Altman analyses. The results showed that scores from remote functional assessment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy strongly correlated with those obtained in person. These findings demonstrate congruence between live stream remote and in-person functional assessment and suggest that remote assessment has the potential to reduce the burden on a family by supplementing in-clinic visits."

The objective of this research was to develop a novel, disease-specific caregiver-reported outcome measure for use in FRDA research and clinical care. In prior work, we conducted qualitative interviews and a cross-sectional study of FRDA caregivers and patients to determine the symptoms of greatest importance to individuals with FRDA. We designed the Friedreich Ataxia Caregiver-Reported Health Index (FACR-HI) to serially measure the symptoms of greatest importance to patients and utilized factor analysis, beta testing, reliability testing, and cross-sectional subgroup analysis to further evaluate and optimize this disease-specific outcome measure. The FACR-HI was designed to measure total disease burden and disease burden in 18 symptomatic domains. The FACR-HI total score demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.98) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). Beta interview participants found the FACR-HI to be highly relevant, comprehensive, and easy to use. FACR-HI total and subscale scores were associated with functional staging for ataxia scores and speech impairment. Initial evaluation of the FACR-HI supports its content validity, test-retest reliability, and construct validity as a caregiver-reported outcome measure for assessing how pediatric individuals with FRDA feel and function. The FACR-HI provides a potential mechanism to quantify changes in multifactorial FRDA disease burden during future clinical trials."

Gene therapy opens up new options for DMD patients. Against the background of a further death following DMD gene therapy, the side effects and risks of the gene therapeutics already approved or undergoing clinical trials will be evaluated and alternative gene therapeutics will be described. Based thereon, the future of DMD gene therapy will be discussed. For the first time, in June 2023, delandistrogene moxeparvovec (SRP-9001), a gene replacement therapy based on an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, was approved in the USA for children aged 4-5 years with DMD. Other promising gene therapies are in preclinical development or clinical trials, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategies to restore dystrophin expression. Two deaths following DMD gene therapy with high-dose AAV vectors were attributed to AAV-mediated immune responses. The pre-existing disease underlying the therapy is most likely involved in the fatal AAV toxicity. Although gene therapy applications of AAV vectors are generally considered safe, the systemic administration of high vector doses can lead to severe side effects with a potentially fatal outcome in individual patients, especially after activation of the immune system. In the future, new methods for immunosuppression, reduction of AAV dose and alternative vectors will therefore increasingly come to the fore."

Here we develop a triple vector system to deliver FL-dystrophin into skeletal and cardiac muscles. We rationally split FL-dystrophin into three fragments (N, M, and C) linked to two orthogonal pairs of split intein, allowing efficient, unidirectional assembly of FL-dystrophin. The three fragments packaged in myotropic AAV (MyoAAV4A) restore FL-dystrophin expression in both skeletal and cardiac muscles in male <i>mdx</i> <sup><i>4cv</i></sup> mice. Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex components are also restored in the sarcolemma of dystrophic muscles. MyoAAV4A-delivered FL-dystrophin significantly improves muscle histopathology, contractility, and overall strength comparable to µDys, but unlike µDys, it also restores defective ERK signaling in heart. The FL-dystrophin gene therapy therefore promises to offer superior protection for DMD."

DMD is caused by loss of dystrophin protein, which results in sarcolemmal instability and cycles of myofiber degeneration and regeneration. Pathology is exacerbated by overactivation of infiltrating immune cells and fibroblasts, which leads to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), a type of nuclear steroid hormone receptors, are potential therapeutic targets for DMD. MR antagonists show clinical efficacy on DMD cardiomyopathy and preclinical efficacy on skeletal muscle in DMD models. <b>Methods:</b> We have previously generated myofiber and myeloid MR knockout mouse models to dissect cell-specific functions of MR within dystrophic muscles. Here, we compared skeletal muscle gene expression from both knockouts to further define cell-type specific signaling downstream from MR. <b>Results:</b> Myeloid MR knockout increased proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling, including numerous myofibroblast signature genes. <i>Tenascin C</i> was the most highly upregulated fibrotic gene in myeloid MR-knockout skeletal muscle and is a component of fibrosis in dystrophic skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, <i>lysyl oxidase</i> (<i>Lox</i>), canonically a collagen crosslinker, was increased in both MR knockouts, but did not localize to fibrotic regions of skeletal muscle. Lox localized within myofibers, including only a region of quadriceps muscles. <i>Lysyl oxidase like 1</i> (<i>Loxl1</i>), another Lox family member, was increased only in myeloid MR knockout muscle and localized specifically to fibrotic regions. <b>Discussion:</b> This study suggests that MR signaling in the dystrophic muscle microenvironment involves communication between contributing cell types and modulates inflammatory and fibrotic pathways in muscle disease."

We analysed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) mesothelioma RNAseq, mutation, and clinical data to assess the association between <i>DMD</i> gene expression and its transcripts (Dp427, Dp71 splice variants) and mesothelioma survival. We also evaluated the specific Dp71 transcript as a unique prognostic biomarker across mesothelioma subtypes.

The analysis included 57 epithelioid, 23 biphasic, two sarcomatoid, and five not otherwise specified (NOS) histological subtypes of mesothelioma samples. Univariate analysis revealed that high expression of the <i>DMD</i> gene and its Dp71 transcript was significantly associated with shorter survival in mesothelioma patients (P<i>=</i>0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, the association between Dp71 expression and survival remained significant [hazard ratio (HR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-4.23, P<i>=</i>0.008] across all mesothelioma patients, and also among patients with mesotheliomas without deep <i>CDKN2A</i> deletions (HR 3.58, 95% CI: 1.31-9.80, P<i>=</i>0.01).

Sutherland's classification has been developed 40 years ago. Ever since, the state-of-the-art medical care has improved and boys with DMD are now longer ambulatory. Therefore, the gait classification requires an update. The overall aim was to develop an up-to-date, valid DMD gait classification. A total of 137 three-dimensional gait analysis sessions were collected in 30 boys with DMD, aged 4.6-17 years. Three classes were distinguished, which only partly aligned with increasing severity of gait deviations. Apart from the mildly affected pattern, two more severely affected gait patterns were found, namely the tiptoeing pattern and the flexion pattern with distinct anterior pelvic tilt and posterior trunk leaning, which showed most severe deviations at the ankle or at the proximal segments/joints, respectively. The agreement between Sutherland's and the current classification was low, suggesting that gait pathology with the current state-of-the-art medical care has changed. However, overlap between classes, especially between the two more affected classes, highlights the complexity of the continuous gait changes. Therefore, caution is required when classifying individual boys with DMD into classes."

It is important to diagnose DMD during infancy or toddler stage in order to have timely access to treatment, opportunities for reproductive options, prevention of potential fatal reactions to inhaled anesthetics, awareness of a child's abilities needed for good parenting, and opportunities for enrolment in clinical trials. We aimed to develop a short risk assessment tool based on developmental milestones that may contribute to the early detection of boys with DMD in primary care. As part of the case-control 4D-DMD study (Detection by Developmental Delay in Dutch boys with DMD), data on developmental milestones, symptoms and therapies for 76 boys with DMD and 12,414 boys from a control group were extracted from the health records of youth health care services and questionnaires. Multiple imputation, diagnostic validity and pooled backward logistic regression analyses with DMD (yes/no) as the dependent variable and attainment of 26 milestones until 36 months of age (yes/no) as the independent variable were performed. Descriptive statistics on symptoms and therapies were provided. A tool with seven milestones assessed at specific ages between 12 and 36 months resulted in a sensitivity of 79% (95CI:67-88%), a specificity of 95.8% (95%CI:95.3-96.2), and a positive predictive value of 1:268 boys. Boys with DMD often had symptoms (e.g. 43% had calf muscle pseudohypertrophy) and were referred to therapy (e.g. 59% for physical therapy) before diagnosis. This tool followed by the examination of other DMD-related symptoms could be used by youth health care professionals during day-to-day health assessments in the general population to flag children who require further action. The majority of boys (79%) with DMD can be identified between 12 and 36 months of age with this tool. It increases the initial a priori risk of DMD from 1 in 5,000 to approximately 1 in 268 boys. We expect that other neuromuscular disorders and disabilities can also be found with this tool."

    "title": "Definition of diaphragmatic sleep disordered breathing and clinical meaning in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic sleep disordered breathing (dSDB) has been recently identified as sleep dysfunction secondary to diaphragmatic weakness in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, scoring criteria for the identification of dSDB are missing.This study aimed to define and validate dSDB scoring criteria and to evaluate whether dSDB severity correlates with respiratory progression in DMD. Scoring criteria for diaphragmatic apnoea (dA) and hypopnoeas (dH) have been defined by the authors considering the pattern observed on cardiorespiratory polygraphy (CR) and the dSDB pathophysiology.10 sleep professionals (physiologists, consultants) blinded to each other were involved in a two-round Delphi survey to rate each item of the proposed dSDB criteria (Likert scale 1-5) and to recognise dSDB among other SDB. The scorers' accuracy was tested against the authors' panel.Finally, CR previously conducted in DMD in clinical setting were rescored and diaphragmatic Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (dAHI) was derived. Pulmonary function (forced vital capacity per cent of predicted, FVC%pred), overnight oxygen saturation (SpO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO2) were correlated with dAHI. After the second round of Delphi, raters deemed each item of dA and dH criteria as relevant as 4 or 5. The agreement with the panel in recognising dSDB was 81%, kappa 0.71, sensitivity 77% and specificity 85%.32 CRs from DMD patients were reviewed. dSDB was previously scored as obstructive. The dAHI negatively correlated with FVC%pred (r=-0.4; p<0.05). The total number of dA correlated with mean overnight tcCO2 (r 0.4; p<0.05). dSDB is a newly defined sleep disorder that correlates with DMD progression. A prospective study to evaluate dSDB as a respiratory measure for DMD in clinical and research settings is planned."

    "title": "Cyclo His-Pro Attenuates Muscle Degeneration in Murine Myopathy Models.",
    "abstract": "Among the inherited myopathies, a group of muscular disorders characterized by structural and metabolic impairments in skeletal muscle, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) stands out for its devastating progression. DMD pathogenesis is driven by the progressive degeneration of muscle fibers, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis that ultimately affect the overall muscle biomechanics. At the opposite end of the spectrum of muscle diseases, age-related sarcopenia is a common condition that affects an increasing proportion of the elderly. Although characterized by different pathological mechanisms, DMD and sarcopenia share the development of progressive muscle weakness and tissue inflammation. Here, the therapeutic effects of Cyclo Histidine-Proline (CHP) against DMD and sarcopenia are evaluated. In the mdx mouse model of DMD, it is shown that CHP restored muscle contractility and force production, accompanied by the reduction of fibrosis and inflammation in skeletal muscle. CHP furthermore prevented the development of cardiomyopathy and fibrosis in the diaphragm, the two leading causes of death for DMD patients. CHP also attenuated muscle atrophy and functional deterioration in a mouse model of age-related sarcopenia. These findings from two different models of muscle dysfunction hence warrant further investigation into the effects of CHP on muscle pathologies in animal models and eventually in patients."

    "abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) face a higher risk of neurobehavioral problems, yet an international consensus on screening, assessing, and managing these difficulties is lacking. This report introduces the term Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-Associated Neurobehavioral Difficulties (DuMAND) to comprehensively cover the spectrum of neurobehavioral issues in DMD patients, including behavior, psychiatric disorders, and various cognitive, academic, and psychosocial deficits. To facilitate screening, the DuMAND Checklist, a 43-item tool with five subscales, was developed. DuMAND categories were derived through literature review, parent (48 mothers and 37 fathers), and expert (n = 28) input and feedback. The DuMAND Checklist subscales were developed iteratively, incorporating item selection, expert panel (n = 10) assessment for face validity, comprehensiveness, and a pilot validation study in a DMD sample (n = 20). DuMAND encompasses five categories: cognition and learning, social responsiveness, emotion regulation, externalizing behavior, and eating and sleeping. Preliminary validation of the DuMAND Checklist indicates acceptable-to-excellent internal consistency and construct validity. By introducing the DuMAND concept, this study seeks to inspire a consensus approach for screening, assessing, and managing neurobehavioral issues in DMD. Incorporating screening, using the DuMAND Checklist, in addition to medical follow-up will facilitate early intervention, addressing a critical gap in identification of neurobehavioral disorders in DMD. Future research is needed to further evaluate psychometric properties of the DuMAND Checklist and investigate the natural course of DuMAND."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, resulting in the loss of dystrophin, a large cytosolic protein that links the cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix receptors in skeletal muscle. Aside from progressive muscle damage, many patients with DMD also have neurological deficits of unknown etiology. To investigate potential mechanisms for DMD neurological deficits, we assessed postnatal oligodendrogenesis and myelination in the Dmdmdx mouse model. In the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) stem cell niche, we found that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) production was deficient, with reduced OPC densities and proliferation, despite a normal stem cell niche organization. In the Dmdmdx corpus callosum, a large white matter tract adjacent to the V-SVZ, we also observed reduced OPC proliferation and fewer oligodendrocytes. Transmission electron microscopy further revealed significantly thinner myelin, an increased number of abnormal myelin structures and delayed myelin compaction, with hypomyelination persisting into adulthood. Our findings reveal alterations in oligodendrocyte development and myelination that support the hypothesis that changes in diffusion tensor imaging seen in patients with DMD reflect developmental changes in myelin architecture."

We conducted qualitative interviews with individuals with DMD and caregivers of individuals with DMD to identify potential symptoms of importance to those living with DMD. We subsequently performed a cross-sectional study to assess which symptoms have the highest prevalence and importance in DMD and to determine which factors are associated with a higher disease burden. Thirty-nine individuals, aged 11 years and above, provided 3262 quotes regarding the symptomatic burden of DMD. Two hundred participants (87 individuals with DMD and 113 caregivers) participated in a subsequent cross-sectional study. Individuals with DMD identified limitations with mobility or walking (100%), inability to do activities (98.9%), trouble getting around (97.6%), and leg weakness (97.6%) as the most prevalent and life altering symptomatic themes in DMD. The symptomatic themes with the highest prevalence, as reported by caregivers on behalf of those with DMD for whom they care, were limitations with mobility or walking (90.3%), leg weakness (89.2%), and emotional issues (79.6%). Steroid/glucocorticoid use (e.g., prednisone or deflazacort) was associated with a lower level of disease burden in DMD. There are many symptomatic themes that contribute to disease burden in individuals with DMD. These symptoms are identified by both individuals with DMD and their caregivers and have a variable level of importance and prevalence in the DMD population."

    "abstract": "X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare, life-threatening congenital disease, which is not well-defined. To our knowledge, no studies characterizing the XLMTM disease burden have been conducted in Brazil. We identified and described patients with suspected XLMTM using administrative claims data from the Brazilian public healthcare system. Data from 2015 to 2019 were extracted from the DATASUS database. As no XLMTM-specific ICD-10 code was available, a stepwise algorithm was applied to identify patients with suspected XLMTM by selecting male patients with a congenital myopathies code (G71.2), aged < 18 years at index date (first claim of G71.2), with an associated diagnostic procedure (muscle biopsy/genetic test) and without spinal muscular atrophy or Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We attempted to identify patients with suspected severe XLMTM based on use of both respiratory and feeding support, which are nearly universal in the care of XLMTM patients. Analyses were performed for the overall cohort and stratified by age at index date < 5 years old and ≥ 5 years old. Of 173 patients with suspected XLMTM identified, 39% were < 5 years old at index date. Nearly all (N = 166) patients (96%) were diagnosed by muscle biopsy (91% of patients < 5 years old and 99% of patients ≥ 5 years old), six (3.5%) were diagnosed by clinical evaluation (8% of patients < 5 years old and 1% of patients ≥ 5 years old), and one was diagnosed by a genetic test. Most patients lived in Brasilia (n = 55), São Paulo (n = 33) and Minas Gerais (n = 27). More than 85% of patients < 5 years old and approximately 75% of patients ≥ 5 years old had physiotherapy at the index date. In both age groups, nearly 50% of patients required hospitalization at some point and 25% required mobility support. Respiratory and feeding support were required for 3% and 12% of patients, respectively, suggesting that between 5 and 21 patients may have had severe XLMTM. In this real-world study, genetic testing for XLMTM appears to be underutilized in Brazil and may contribute to underdiagnosis of the disease. Access to diagnosis and care is limited outside of specific regions with specialized clinics and hospitals. Substantial use of healthcare resources included hospitalization, physiotherapy, mobility support, and, to a lesser extent, feeding support and respiratory support."

SVs in DMD remain difficult to reliably detect due to the limited SV-detection capacity of conventionally used short-read sequencing technology. Herein, we present a family, a boy and his mother, with clinical signs of muscular dystrophy, elevated creatinine kinase levels, and intellectual disability. A muscle biopsy from the boy showed dystrophin deficiency. Routine molecular techniques failed to detect abnormalities in the DMD gene, however, dystrophin mRNA transcripts analysis revealed an absence of exons 59 to 79. Subsequent long-read whole-genome sequencing identified a rare complex structural variant, a 77 kb novel intragenic inversion, and a balanced translocation t(X;1)(p21.2;p13.3) rearrangement within the DMD gene, expanding the genetic spectrum of dystrophinopathy. Our findings suggested that SVs should be considered in cases where conventional molecular techniques fail to identify pathogenic variants."

However, low satellite cell yield from autologous or donor-derived muscles hinders the adoption of satellite cell transplantation for the treatment of muscle diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). To address this limitation, here we investigated whether satellite cells can be derived in allogeneic or xenogeneic animal hosts. First, injection of CRISPR/Cas9-corrected Dmdmdx mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into mouse blastocysts carrying an ablation system of host satellite cells gave rise to intraspecies chimeras exclusively carrying iPSC-derived satellite cells. Furthermore, injection of genetically corrected DMD iPSCs into rat blastocysts resulted in the formation of interspecies rat-mouse chimeras harboring mouse satellite cells. Notably, iPSC-derived satellite cells or derivative myoblasts produced in intraspecies or interspecies chimeras restored dystrophin expression in DMD mice following intramuscular transplantation and contributed to the satellite cell pool. Collectively, this study demonstrates the feasibility of producing therapeutically competent stem cells across divergent animal species, raising the possibility of generating human muscle stem cells in large animals for regenerative medicine purposes."

We examined the efficiency and efficacy of this strategy with 4 microdystrophin constructs (3 in clinical trials and a variant of the largest clinical construct), in a severe mouse model of DMD, using AAV doses comparable with those in clinical trials. We achieved high levels of microdystrophin expression in striated muscles with cardiac expression approximately 10-fold higher than that observed in skeletal muscle. Significant, albeit incomplete, correction of skeletal muscle disease was observed. Surprisingly, a lethal acceleration of cardiac disease occurred with 2 of the microdystrophins. The detrimental cardiac effect appears to be caused by variable competition (dependent on microdystrophin design and expression level) between microdystrophin and utrophin at the cardiomyocyte membrane. There may also be a contribution from an overloading of protein degradation. The significance of these observations for patients currently being treated with AAV-microdystrophin therapies is unclear since the levels of expression being achieved in the DMD hearts are unknown. However, these findings suggest that microdystrophin treatments need to avoid excessively high levels of expression in the heart and that cardiac function should be carefully monitored in these patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked recessive disease due to loss-of-function mutations in the <i>DYSTROPHIN</i> gene. DMD-related skeletal muscle wasting is typified by an aberrant immune response involving upregulation of TGFβ family of cytokines. We previously demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is increased in DMD and BMP4 stimulation induces a 20-fold upregulation of <i>Smad8</i> transcription. However, the role of BMP4 in severely affected DMD skeletal muscle is unknown. We hypothesized that transcriptomic signatures in severely affected human DMD skeletal muscle are driven by BMP4 signaling. Transcriptomes from skeletal muscle biopsies of late-stage DMD vs. non-DMD controls and C2C12 muscle cells with or without BMP4 stimulation were generated by RNA-Seq and analyzed for single transcript differential expression as well as by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analyses. A total of 2,328 and 5,291 transcripts in the human muscle and C2C12 muscle cells, respectively, were differentially expressed. We identified an overlapping molecular signature of 1,027 genes dysregulated in DMD muscle that were induced in BMP4-stimulated C2C12 muscle cells. Highly upregulated DMD transcripts that overlapped with BMP4-stimulated C2C12 muscle cells included <i>ADAMTS3, HCAR2, SERPING1, SMAD8</i> , and <i>UNC13C.</i> The DMD transcriptome was characterized by dysregulation of pathways involving immune function, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metabolic/mitochondrial function. In summary, we define a late-stage DMD skeletal muscle transcriptome that substantially overlaps with the BMP4-induced molecular signature in C2C12 muscle cells. This supports BMP4 as a disease-driving regulator of transcriptomic changes in late-stage DMD skeletal muscle and expands our understanding of the evolution of dystrophic signaling pathways and their associated gene networks that could be explored for therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease. Cycles of myofibre degeneration and regeneration are hallmarks of the disease where immune cells infiltrate to repair damaged skeletal muscle. Benfotiamine is a lipid soluble precursor to thiamine, shown clinically to reduce inflammation in diabetic related complications. We assessed whether benfotiamine administration could reduce inflammation related dystrophic pathology. Benfotiamine (10 mg/kg/day) was fed to male mdx mice (n = 7) for 15 weeks from 4 weeks of age. Treated mice had an increased growth weight (5-7 weeks) and myofibre size at treatment completion. Markers of dystrophic pathology (area of damaged necrotic tissue, central nuclei) were reduced in benfotiamine mdx quadriceps. Grip strength was increased and improved exercise capacity was found in mdx treated with benfotiamine for 12 weeks, before being placed into individual cages and allowed access to an exercise wheel for 3 weeks. Global gene expression profiling (RNAseq) in the gastrocnemius revealed benfotiamine regulated signalling pathways relevant to dystrophic pathology (Inflammatory Response, Myogenesis) and fibrotic gene markers (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col4a5, Col5a2, Col6a2, Col6a2, Col6a3, Lum) towards wildtype levels. In addition, we observed a reduction in gene expression of inflammatory gene markers in the quadriceps (Emr1, Cd163, Cd4, Cd8, Ifng). Overall, these data suggest that benfotiamine reduces dystrophic pathology by acting on inflammatory and fibrotic gene markers and signalling pathways. Given benfotiamine's excellent safety profile and current clinical use, it could be used in combination with glucocorticoids to treat DMD patients."

    "abstract": "Clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) require 3-6 months of stable glucocorticoids, and the primary outcome is explored at 48-52 weeks. The factors that influence the clinical outcome assessment (COA) trajectories soon after glucocorticoid initiation are relevant for the design and analysis of clinical trials of novel drugs. We describe early COA trajectories, associated factors, and the time from glucocorticoid initiation to COA peak. This was a prospective 18-month analysis of the Finding the Optimum Corticosteroid Regimen for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy study. Four COAs were investigated: rise from supine velocity (RFV), 10-meter walk/run velocity (10MWRV), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score, and 6-minute walk test distance (6MWT). The relationships of baseline age (4-5 vs 6-7 years), COA baseline performance, genotype, and glucocorticoid regimen (daily vs intermittent) with the COA trajectories were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models. One hundred ninety-six glucocorticoid-naïve boys with DMD aged 4-7 years were enrolled. The mean age at baseline was 5.9 ± 1.0 years, 66% (n = 130) were on daily regimens, 55% (n = 107) showed a 6MWT distance >330 metres; 41% (n = 78) showed RFV >0.2 rise/s; 76% (n = 149) showed 10MWRV >0.142 10m/s, and 41.0% (n = 79) showed NSAA total score >22 points. Mean COA trajectories differed by age at glucocorticoid initiation (<i>p</i> < 0.01 for RFV, 10MWRV, and NSAA; <i>p</i> < 0.05 for 6MWT) and regimen (<i>p</i> < 0.01 for RFV, 10MWRV, and NSAA). Boys younger than 6 years reached their peak performance 12-18 months after glucocorticoid initiation. Boys aged 6 years or older on a daily regimen peaked between months 9 and 12 and those on an intermittent regimen by 9 months. The baseline COA performance was associated with the NSAA (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and the 6MWT trajectory in boys younger than 6 years on a daily regimen (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Differences in the mean trajectories by genotype were not significant. Glucocorticoid regimen, age, duration of glucocorticoid exposure, and baseline COA performance need to be considered in the design and analysis of clinical trials in young boys with DMD."

This qualitative study explores the social and emotional implications of key transitions, challenges and adaptations throughout the disease course from the perspective of patients and family caregivers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with men and boys with DMD, and/or their caregivers, in the USA. Thematic analysis was used to examine patterns in data collected across the interviews. Nineteen participants were included. Three major themes were identified: (1) barriers to participation are multifaceted; (2) an emotional journey shaped by 'inevitable progression;' (3) family provides critical tangible and emotional support. This study illustrates that psychosocial impacts of DMD are shaped by knowledge of the condition's natural history alongside other factors including the extent of social barriers, personal growth and adaptation, and family support. Findings provide insight into the strength and resilience with which individuals and their families respond to daily challenges and major clinical milestones and highlight the relative importance of loss of upper limb function as a transition in DMD affecting health-related quality-of-life."

While many animal models have been used to study the disease, translating findings to humans has been challenging. Microminipigs, with their pronounced physiological similarity to humans and notably compact size amongst pig models, could offer a more representative model for human diseases. Here, we accomplished precise DMD modification in microminipigs by co-injecting embryos with Cas9 protein and a single-guide RNA targeting exon 23 of DMD. The DMD-edited microminipigs exhibited pronounced clinical phenotypes, including perturbed locomotion and body-wide skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy, alongside augmented serum creatine kinase levels. Muscle weakness was observed as of one month of age, respiratory and cardiac dysfunctions emerged by the sixth month, and the maximum lifespan was 29.9 months. Histopathological evaluations confirmed dystrophin deficiency and pronounced dystrophic pathology in the skeletal and myocardial tissues, demonstrating that these animals are an unprecedented model for studying human DMD. The model stands as a distinct and crucial tool in biomedical research, offering deep understanding of disease progression and enhancing therapeutic assessments, with potential to influence forthcoming treatment approaches."

The substantial impact of these complex behavioral challenges in addition to motor function decline on the well-being of affected individuals and their families is increasingly evident. However, a uniform approach for effective screening, assessment and management of the neurobehavioral symptoms remains elusive. We explored strategies used by healthcare professionals with clinical expertise in DMD to address neurobehavioral symptoms, in order to uncover diverse practices and to identify potential directions for clinical approaches in managing DMD neurobehavioral symptoms. Twenty-eight respondents from 16 different countries completed an online survey. Only 35% of the centers systematically screened for neurobehavioral difficulties in their DMD population. Predominant screening methods included history taking and clinical observation. Common neurobehavioral difficulties encompassed learning challenges, dependency from adults, anxiety, concentration difficulties, and social deficits. The participating centers frequently employed parental counseling and liaison with psychosocial healthcare professionals for psychosocial intervention. This study underscores the complex behavioral landscape in DMD, highlighting the need for validated screening, assessment and management strategies and collaborative efforts in implementing these. We advocate for international consensus recommendations for screening, assessment and management of neurobehavioral difficulties in DMD to enhance patient care and communication across healthcare settings."

Health insurance claims allow characterization of population-level real-world outcomes, based on observed healthcare resource use. An analysis of data specific to those with Medicaid insurance is presently unavailable. The objective was to describe the real-world clinical course of DMD based on claims data from Medicaid-insured individuals in the USA. Individuals with DMD were identified from the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid datasets (2013-2018). Diagnosis and procedure codes from healthcare claims were used to characterize the occurrence of DMD-relevant clinical observations; categories were scoliosis, cardiovascular-related, respiratory and severe respiratory-related, and neurologic/neuropsychiatric. Age-restricted analyses were conducted to focus on the ages at which DMD-relevant clinical observations were more likely to be captured, and to better understand the impact of both age and follow-up time. Of 2007 patients with DMD identified, median (interquartile range) age at index was 14 (9-20) years, and median follow-up was 3.1 (1.6-4.7) years. Neurologic and neuropsychiatric observations were most frequently identified, among 49.3% of the cohort; followed by cardiovascular (48.5%), respiratory (38.1%), scoliosis (36.3%), and severe respiratory (25.0%). Prevalence estimates for each category were higher when analyzed within age-restricted subgroups; and increased as follow-up time increased. This study is the first to use diagnosis and procedure codes from real-world Medicaid claims to document the clinical course in DMD. Findings were consistent with previously published estimates from commercially insured populations and clinical registries; and contribute to the expanding body of real-world evidence around clinical progression of patients with DMD."

These conditions, characterized by muscle weakness, also manifest central nervous system (CNS) comorbidities due to dystrophin expression in the CNS. Prior studies have indicated a higher prevalence of epilepsy in individuals with dystrophinopathy compared to the general population. Our research aimed to investigate epilepsy prevalence in dystrophinopathies and characterize associated electroencephalograms (EEGs) and seizures. We reviewed 416 individuals with dystrophinopathy, followed up at three centers between 2010 and 2023, to investigate the lifetime epilepsy prevalence and characterize EEGs and seizures in those individuals diagnosed with epilepsy. Associations between epilepsy and type of dystrophinopathy, genotype, and cognitive involvement were studied. Our study revealed a higher epilepsy prevalence than the general population (1.4%; 95% confidence interval: 0.7-3.2%), but notably lower than previously reported in smaller dystrophinopathy cohorts. No significant differences were found in epilepsy prevalence between DMD and BMD or based on underlying genotypes. Cognitive impairment was not found to be linked to higher epilepsy rates. The most prevalent epilepsy types in dystrophinopathies resembled those observed in the broader pediatric population, with most individuals effectively controlled through monotherapy. The actual epilepsy prevalence in dystrophinopathies may be markedly lower than previously estimated, possibly half or even less. Our study provides valuable insights into the epilepsy landscape in individuals with dystrophinopathy, impacting medical care, especially for those with concurrent epilepsy."

Here, we investigated the role of SETDB1 (SET domain, bifurcated 1), a histone lysine methyltransferase involved in muscle differentiation. Our data show that, following TGFβ induction, SETDB1 accumulates in the nuclei of healthy myotubes while being already present in the nuclei of DMD myotubes where TGFβ signaling is constitutively activated. Transcriptomics revealed that depletion of SETDB1 in DMD myotubes leads to down-regulation of TGFβ target genes coding for secreted factors involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and inflammation. Consequently, SETDB1 silencing in DMD myotubes abrogates the deleterious effect of their secretome on myoblast differentiation by impairing myoblast pro-fibrotic response. Our findings indicate that SETDB1 potentiates the TGFβ-driven fibrotic response in DMD muscles, providing an additional axis for therapeutic intervention."

In total, 234 (63.7%) of 367 adult DMD patients (mean age, 27.4 ± 6.0; range, 20-48 years) completed the questionnaire. Of these, 38 (21%) had developmental disorders (mental retardation, autism, and learning disorders), 57 (33%) experienced bullying in school, and 44 (77%) indicated the reason for bullying to be their physical handicap. Employment histories were noted by 72 (31%), although 23 (10%) lost their jobs mainly due to physical difficulties. Of the 234 patients, 164 (74%) lived with their relatives, and 78% of care time was supplied by family members, in particular, their mothers. The mean rate of care work provided by family members was 81%. Household income of families with an adult DMD patient was lower, whereas the rate of living with parent(s) and grandparent(s) was higher, in comparison with the general Japanese population. Adult DMD patients in Japan experience many social difficulties from childhood up to adulthood. As adults, many DMD patients experience bullying and workplace difficulties. Families were found to provide most of the care and financial support for DMD patients. Our results suggest the need to improve public patient care systems, including financial support, to address the physical and economic burdens of care for adult DMD patients in Japan."

    "abstract": "Successful CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in skeletal muscle is dependent on efficient propagation of Cas9 to all myonuclei in the myofiber. However, nuclear-targeted gene therapy cargos are strongly restricted to their myonuclear domain of origin. By screening nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals, we identify \"Myospreader,\" a combination of short peptide sequences that promotes myonuclear propagation. Appending Myospreader to Cas9 enhances protein stability and myonuclear propagation in myoblasts and myofibers. AAV-delivered Myospreader dCas9 better inhibits transcription of toxic RNA in a myotonic dystrophy mouse model. Furthermore, Myospreader Cas9 achieves higher rates of gene editing in CRISPR reporter and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models. Myospreader reveals design principles relevant to all nuclear-targeted gene therapies and highlights the importance of the spatial dimension in therapeutic development."

    "abstract": "Dystrophinopathies, such as Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, frequently lead to cardiomyopathy, being its primary cause of mortality. Detecting cardiac dysfunction early is crucial, but current imaging methods lack insight into microstructural remodeling. This study aims to assess the potential of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parametric mappings for early detection of myocardial involvement in dystrophinopathies and explores whether distinct involvement patterns may indicate impending dysfunction. In this prospective study, 23 dystrophinopathy patients underwent CMR with tissue mappings. To establish a basis for comparison, a control group of 173 subjects was analyzed. CMR protocols included SSFP, T2-weighted and T1-weighted sequences pre and post gadolinium, and tissue mappings for native T1 (nT1), extracellular volume (ECV), and T2 relaxation times. The difference between the left ventricular posterior wall and the interventricular septum was calculated to reveal asymmetric myocardial involvement. Significant differences in LV ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial mass, and late gadolinium enhancement confirmed abnormalities in patients. Tissue mappings: nT1 (p < 0.001) and ECV (p = 0.002), but not T2, displayed substantial variations, suggesting sensitivity to myocardial involvement. Asymmetric myocardial involvement in nT1 (p = 0.01) and ECV (p = 0.012) between septal and LV posterior wall regions was significant. While higher mapping values didn't correlate with dysfunction, asymmetric involvement in nT1 (ρ=-0.472, p = 0.023) and ECV (ρ=-0.460, p = 0.049) exhibited a significant negative correlation with LVEF. CMR mappings show promise in early myocardial damage detection in dystrophinopathies. Although mapping values may not directly correspond to dysfunction, the negative correlation between asymmetric involvement in nT1 and ECV with LVEF suggests their potential as early biomarkers. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed for a comprehensive understanding and improved risk stratification in dystrophinopathies."

Identifying patients at risk of early death could allow for increased monitoring and more intensive therapy. Measures that associate with death could serve as surrogate outcomes in clinical trials. Duchenne muscular dystrophy subjects prospectively enrolled in observational studies were included. Models using generalized least squares were used to assess the difference of cardiac magnetic resonance measurements between deceased and alive subjects. A total of 63 participants underwent multiple cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and were included in the analyses. Twelve subjects (19.1%) died over a median follow-up of 5 years (interquartile range, 3.1-7.0). Rate of decline in left ventricular ejection fraction was faster in deceased than alive subjects (<i>P</i><0.0001). Rate of increase in indexed left ventricular end-diastolic (<i>P</i>=0.0132) and systolic (<i>P</i><0.0001) volumes were higher in deceased subjects. Faster worsening in midcircumferential strain was seen in deceased subjects (<i>P</i>=0.049) while no difference in global circumferential strain was seen. The rate of increase in late gadolinium enhancement, base T1, and mid T1 did not differ between groups. Duchenne muscular dystrophy death is associated with the rate of change in left ventricular ejection fraction, midcircumferential strain, and ventricular volumes. Aggressive medical therapy to decrease the rate of progression may improve the mortality rate in this population. A decrease in the rate of progression may serve as a valid surrogate outcome for therapeutic trials."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic substantially affected the lives of persons with inherited neuromuscular disorders (INMD), causing disruption in clinical and support services. While several studies have investigated mental health, distress and psychosocial resources in the general population during the pandemic, little is known about the experience of persons with INMD. This study was aimed to fill this gap by jointly investigating both psychopathological symptoms and psychosocial resources - specifically, resilience and perceived social support - among persons with INMD during the pandemic, taking into account demographic and clinical factors. Between April and December 2020, 59 participants with INMD (aged 15-59, 71.2% M) completed a questionnaire collecting demographic and clinical data, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Resilience Scale for Adults, and the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. Overall, participants showed good levels of resilience and perceived social support. A minority of participants reported clinically relevant psychopathological symptoms, 28.81% for anxiety and depression. Most psychopathological symptoms were negatively correlated with resilience (-0.347 < r < - .420), but not significantly associated with social support. Consistent with previous studies, regression analyses highlighted that participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were more prone to report anxious and depressive symptoms (B = 1.748, p = .028, OR = 5.744), and participants with myotonic dystrophy, attention problems (B = 2.339, p = .006, OR = 10.376). Resilience emerged as a potential predictor of lower anxious-depressive symptoms (B=-1.264, p = .012, OR = 0.283). The findings suggest the importance to investigate psychosocial resources in addition to psychopathology among persons with INMD, and to design interventions supporting resilience as a protective factor for mental health promotion."

    "abstract": "The muscular dystrophy with myositis (mdm) mouse model results in a severe muscular dystrophy due to an 83-amino-acid deletion in the N2A region of titin, an expanded sarcomeric protein that functions as a molecular spring which senses and modulates the response to mechanical forces in cardiac and skeletal muscles. ANKRD1 is one of the muscle ankyrin repeat domain proteins (MARPs) a family of titin-associated, stress-response molecules and putative transducers of stretch-induced signaling in skeletal muscle. The aberrant over-activation of Nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) and the Ankyrin-repeat domain containing protein 1 (ANKRD1) occurs in several models of progressive muscle disease including Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We hypothesized that mechanical regulation of ANKRD1 is mediated by NF-κB activation in skeletal muscles and that this mechanism is perturbed by small deletion of the stretch-sensing titin N2A region in the mdm mouse. We applied static mechanical stretch of the mdm mouse diaphragm and cyclic mechanical stretch of C<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub> myotubes to examine the interaction between NF-κΒ and ANKRD1 expression utilizing Western blot and qRTPCR. As seen in skeletal muscles of other severe muscular dystrophies, an aberrant increased basal expression of NF-κB and ANKRD1 were observed in the diaphragm muscles of the mdm mice. Our data show that in the mdm diaphragm, basal levels of NF-κB are increased, and pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB does not alter basal levels of ANKRD1. Alternatively, NF-κB inhibition did alter stretch-induced ANKRD1 upregulation. These data show that NF-κB activity is at least partially responsible for the stretch-induced expression of ANKRD1."

Vamorolone, a dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), primarily undergoes oxidation by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. This work assesses the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of vamorolone and sources of interindividual variability (IIV) in 81 steroid-naïve boys with DMD aged 4 to <7 years old considering the genetic polymorphisms of CYPS3A4 (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A4*1B), CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3), and UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*60) utilizing population PK modeling. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption (T<sub>k0</sub>, duration of absorption), linear clearance (CL/F), and volume (V/F) describes the plasma PK data for boys with DMD receiving a wide range of vamorolone doses (0.25-6 mg/kg/day). The typical CL/F and V/F values of vamorolone were 35.8 L/h and 119 L, with modest IIV. The population T<sub>k0</sub> was 3.14 h yielding an average zero-order absorption rate (k<sub>0</sub>) of 1.16 mg/kg/h with similar absorption kinetics across subjects at the same vamorolone dose (i.e., no IIV on T<sub>k0</sub>). The covariate analysis showed that none of the genetic covariates had any significant impact on the PKs of vamorolone in boys with DMD. Thus, the PKs of vamorolone is very consistent in these young boys with DMD."

The dystrophinopathies include the most common inherited muscular dystrophy among 46,XY individuals, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as Becker muscular dystrophy and other less common phenotypic variants. With increased access to and utilization of genetic testing in the diagnostic and carrier setting, genetic counselors and clinicians in diverse specialty areas may care for individuals with and carriers of dystrophinopathy. This practice resource was developed as a tool for genetic counselors and other health care professionals to support counseling regarding dystrophinopathies, including diagnosis, health risks and management, psychosocial needs, reproductive options, clinical trials, and treatment. Genetic testing efforts have enabled genotype/phenotype correlation in the dystrophinopathies, but have also revealed unexpected findings, further complicating genetic counseling for this group of conditions. Additionally, the therapeutic landscape for dystrophinopathies has dramatically changed with several FDA-approved therapeutics, an expansive research pathway, and numerous clinical trials. Genotype-phenotype correlations are especially complex and genetic counselors' unique skill sets are useful in exploring and explaining this to families. Given the recent advances in diagnostic testing and therapeutics related to dystrophinopathies, this practice resource is a timely update for genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and care of individuals with dystrophinopathies."

    "abstract": "The dynamic relationship between heart failure and cancer poses a dual challenge. While cardiac remodeling can promote cancer growth and metastasis, tumor development can ameliorate cardiac dysfunction and suppress fibrosis. However, the precise mechanism through which cancer influences the heart and fibrosis is yet to be uncovered. To further explore the interaction between heart failure and cancer, we used the MDX mouse model, which suffers from cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction. A previous study from our lab demonstrated that tumor growth improves cardiac dysfunction and dampens fibrosis in the heart and diaphragm muscles of MDX mice. We used breast Polyoma middle T (PyMT) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cancer cell lines that developed into large tumors. To explore whether the aggressiveness of the cancer cell line is crucial for the beneficial phenotype, we employed a PyMT breast cancer cell line lacking integrin β1, representing a less aggressive cell line compared to the original PyMT cells. In addition, we examined immortalized and primary MEF cells. The injection of integrin β1 KO PyMT cancer cells and Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts cells (MEF) resulted in the improvement of cardiac function and decreased fibrosis in the heart, diaphragm, and skeletal muscles of MDX mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the cancer line aggressiveness as well as primary MEF cells are sufficient to impose the beneficial phenotype. These discoveries present potential novel clinical therapeutic approaches with beneficial outcome for patients with fibrotic diseases and cardiac dysfunction that do not require tumor growth."

This is essential in maintaining the structure of a myocyte membrane. While casimersen is currently continuing in phase III of clinical trials in various countries, it was granted approval by the FDA under the accelerated approval program due to its observed increase in dystrophin production. This article discusses the pathophysiology of DMD, summarizes available treatments thus far, and provides a full drug review of casimersen (AMONDYS 45<sup>TM</sup>)."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is associated with impaired muscle regeneration, progressive muscle weakness, damage, and wasting. While the cause of DMD is an X-linked loss of function mutation in the gene encoding dystrophin, the exact mechanisms that perpetuate the disease progression are unknown. Our laboratory has demonstrated that pannexin 1 (Panx1 in rodents; PANX1 in humans) is critical for the development, strength, and regeneration of male skeletal muscle. In normal skeletal muscle, Panx1 is part of a multiprotein complex with dystrophin. We and others have previously shown that Panx1 levels and channel activity are dysregulated in various mouse models of DMD. We utilized myoblast cell lines derived from DMD patients to assess PANX1 expression and function. To investigate how Panx1 dysregulation contributes to DMD, we generated a dystrophic (mdx) mouse model that lacks Panx1 (Panx1<sup>-/-</sup>/mdx). In depth characterization of this model included histological analysis, as well as locomotor, and physiological tests such as muscle force and grip strength assessments. Here, we demonstrate that PANX1 levels and channel function are reduced in patient-derived DMD myoblast cell lines. Panx1<sup>-/-</sup>/mdx mice have a significantly reduced lifespan, and decreased body weight due to lean mass loss. Their tibialis anterior were more affected than their soleus muscles and displayed reduced mass, myofiber loss, increased centrally nucleated myofibers, and a lower number of muscle stem cells compared to that of Panx1<sup>+/+</sup>/mdx mice. These detrimental effects were associated with muscle and locomotor functional impairments. In vitro, PANX1 overexpression in patient-derived DMD myoblasts improved their differentiation and fusion. Collectively, our findings suggest that PANX1/Panx1 dysregulation in DMD exacerbates several aspects of the disease. Moreover, our results suggest a potential therapeutic benefit to increasing PANX1 levels in dystrophic muscles."

    "abstract": "Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are crucial to the repair and homeostasis of mature skeletal muscle. MuSC dysfunction and dysregulation of the myogenic program can contribute to the development of pathology ranging from cancers like rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) or muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Both diseases exhibit dysregulation at nearly all steps of myogenesis. For instance, MuSC self-renewal processes are altered. In RMS, this leads to the creation of tumor propagating cells. In DMD, impaired asymmetric stem cell division creates a bias towards producing self-renewing stem cells instead of committing to differentiation. Hyperproliferation of these cells contribute to tumorigenesis in RMS and symmetric expansion of the self-renewing MuSC population in DMD. Both diseases also exhibit a repression of factors involved in terminal differentiation, halting RMS cells in the proliferative stage and thus driving tumor growth. Conversely, the MuSCs in DMD exhibit impaired differentiation and fuse prematurely, affecting myonuclei maturation and the integrity of the dystrophic muscle fiber. Finally, both disease states cause alterations to the MuSC niche. Various elements of the niche such as inflammatory and migratory signaling that impact MuSC behavior are dysregulated. Here we show how these seemingly distantly related diseases indeed have similarities in MuSC dysfunction, underlying the importance of considering MuSCs when studying the pathophysiology of muscle diseases."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a highly represented tissue in mammals and is composed of fibers that are extremely adaptable and capable of regeneration. This characteristic of muscle fibers is made possible by a cell type called satellite cells. Adjacent to the fibers, satellite cells are found in a quiescent state and located between the muscle fibers membrane and the basal lamina. These cells are required for the growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle through myogenesis. This process is known to be tightly sequenced from the activation to the differentiation/fusion of myofibers. However, for the past fifteen years, researchers have been interested in examining satellite cell heterogeneity and have identified different subpopulations displaying distinct characteristics based on localization, quiescence state, stemness capacity, cell-cycle progression or gene expression. A small subset of satellite cells appears to represent multipotent long-term self-renewing muscle stem cells (MuSC). All these distinctions led us to the hypothesis that the characteristics of myogenesis might not be linear and therefore may be more permissive based on the evidence that satellite cells are a heterogeneous population. In this review, we discuss the different subpopulations that exist within the satellite cell pool to highlight the heterogeneity and to gain further understanding of the myogenesis progress. Finally, we discuss the long term self-renewing MuSC subpopulation that is capable of dividing asymmetrically and discuss the molecular mechanisms regulating MuSC polarization during health and disease."

This systematic review and meta-analysis included searches of MEDLINE ALL, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2022, for predictors of loss of ambulation in DMD. Search terms included \"Duchenne muscular dystrophy\" as a Medical Subject Heading or free text term, in combination with variations of the term \"predictor\". Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We performed meta-analysis pooling of hazard ratios of the effects of glucocorticoids (vs. no glucocorticoid therapy) by fitting a common-effect inverse-variance model. The bibliographic searches resulted in the inclusion of 45 studies of children and adults with DMD from 17 countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. Glucocorticoid therapy was associated with delayed loss of ambulation (overall meta-analysis HR deflazacort/prednisone/prednisolone: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.40-0.48]) (n = 25 studies). Earlier onset of first signs or symptoms, earlier loss of developmental milestones, lower baseline 6MWT (i.e.,<350 vs. ≥350 metres and <330 vs. ≥330 metres), and lower baseline NSAA were associated with earlier loss of ambulation (n = 5 studies). Deletion of exons 3-7, proximal mutations (upstream intron 44), single exon 45 deletions, and mutations amenable of skipping exon 8, exon 44, and exon 53, were associated with prolonged ambulation; distal mutations (intron 44 and downstream), deletion of exons 49-50, and mutations amenable of skipping exon 45, and exon 51 were associated with earlier loss of ambulation (n = 13 studies). Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CD40 gene rs1883832, LTBP4 gene rs10880, SPP1 gene rs2835709 and rs11730582, and TCTEX1D1 gene rs1060575 (n = 7 studies), as well as race/ethnicity and level of family/patient deprivation (n = 3 studies), were associated with loss of ambulation. Treatment with ataluren (n = 2 studies) and eteplirsen (n = 3 studies) were associated with prolonged ambulation. Magnetic resonance biomarkers (MRI and MRS) were identified as significant predictors of loss of ambulation (n = 6 studies). In total, 33% of studies exhibited some risk of bias. Our synthesis of predictors of loss of ambulation in DMD contributes to the understanding the natural history of disease and informs the design of new trials of novel therapies targeting this heavily burdened patient population."

Recent advances in preclinical research have achieved some success in compensating both muscle and brain dysfunctions associated with DMD, notably using exon skipping strategies. However, this has not been studied for distal mutations in the <i>DMD</i> gene leading to Dp71 loss. In this study, we aimed to restore brain Dp71 expression in the Dp71-null transgenic mouse using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) administrated either by intracardiac injections at P4 (ICP4) or by bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in adults. ICP4 delivery of the AAV9-Dp71 vector enabled the expression of 2 to 14% of brain Dp71, while ICV delivery enabled the overexpression of Dp71 in the hippocampus and cortex of adult mice, with anecdotal expression in the cerebellum. The restoration of Dp71 was mostly located in the glial endfeet that surround capillaries, and it was associated with partial localization of Dp71-associated proteins, α1-syntrophin and AQP4 water channels, suggesting proper restoration of a scaffold of proteins involved in blood-brain barrier function and water homeostasis. However, this did not result in significant improvements in behavioral disturbances displayed by Dp71-null mice. The potential and limitations of this AAV-mediated strategy are discussed. This proof-of-concept study identifies key molecular markers to estimate the efficiencies of Dp71 rescue strategies and opens new avenues for enhancing gene therapy targeting cognitive disorders associated with a subgroup of severely affected DMD patients."

    "abstract": "There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that could be treated with classical gene therapy strategies such as the addition of the defective gene via viral or non-viral delivery or by direct gene editing. However, several genetic defects are too complex for these approaches. These \"genomic mutations\" include aneuploidies, intra and inter chromosomal rearrangements, large deletions, or inversion and copy number variations. Chromosome transplantation (CT) refers to the precise substitution of an endogenous chromosome with an exogenous one. By the addition of an exogenous chromosome and the concomitant elimination of the endogenous one, every genetic defect, irrespective of its nature, could be resolved. In the current review, we analyze the state of the art of this technique and discuss its possible application to human pathology. CT might not be limited to the treatment of human diseases. By working on sex chromosomes, we showed that female cells can be obtained from male cells, since chromosome-transplanted cells can lose either sex chromosome, giving rise to 46,XY or 46,XX diploid cells, a modification that could be exploited to obtain female gametes from male cells. Moreover, CT could be used in veterinary biology, since entire chromosomes containing an advantageous locus could be transferred to animals of zootechnical interest without altering their specific genetic background and the need for long and complex interbreeding. CT could also be useful to rescue extinct species if only male cells were available. Finally, the generation of \"synthetic\" cells could be achieved by repeated CT into a recipient cell. CT is an additional tool for genetic modification of mammalian cells."

We also determined the concurrent validity of the Brooke Upper Extremity Scale and PUL for comparison. The ρ value between the FCUE and PUL was -0.914 (P<0.001). The FCUE showed robust concurrent validity with the PUL. That correlation between the FCUE and Brooke Upper Extremity Scale gave a ρ value of -0.854 (P<0.001). The FCUE had a higher concurrent validity with the PUL than with the Brooke Upper Extremity Scale. The FCUE is considered a valid assessment tool of upper-limb function in boys with DMD. Selecting the best assessment method depends on the severity of the patient's condition and a balance between assessment accuracy and evaluation time."

For our study, <i>mdx</i> and wild-type (WT) mice received daily low-dose (2 mg/kg/day) isoproterenol injections for 10 days. Histopathologic assessment showed that isoproterenol treatment increased myocyte injury, elevated serum cardiac troponin I levels, and enhanced fibrosis in <i>mdx</i> mice. Ultrasound revealed reduced ventricular function, decreased wall thickness, increased volumes, and diminished cardiac reserve in mdx mice compared to wild-type. Our findings highlight the utility of low-dose isoproterenol in <i>mdx</i> mice as a valuable model for exploring therapies targeting DMD-associated cardiac complications."

Diaphragmatic weakness in DMD causes hypoventilation and elevated afterload on the right ventricle (RV). Thus, RV dysfunction in DMD develops early in disease progression. Herein, we deliver a 30-min sustained RV preload/afterload challenge to isolated hearts of wild-type (Wt) and dystrophic (Dmd<sup>mdx-4Cv</sup>) mice at both young (2-6 month) and middle-age (8-12 month) to test the hypothesis that the dystrophic RV is susceptible to dysfunction with elevated load. Young dystrophic hearts exhibited greater pressure development than wild type under baseline (Langendorff) conditions, but following RV challenge exhibited similar contractile function as wild type. Following the RV challenge, young dystrophic hearts had an increased incidence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) compared to wild type. Hearts of middle-aged wild-type and dystrophic mice had similar contractile function during baseline conditions. After RV challenge, hearts of middle-aged dystrophic mice had severe RV dysfunction and arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia. Following the RV load challenge, dystrophic hearts had greater lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release than wild-type mice indicative of damage.

    "title": "Genetic therapies and respiratory outcomes in patients with neuromuscular disease.",
    "abstract": "Genetic therapies made a significant impact to the clinical course of patients with spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Clinicians and therapists who care for these patients want to know the changes in respiratory sequelae and implications for clinical care for treated patients. Different genetic therapy approaches have been developed to replace the deficient protein product in spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The natural history of these conditions needed to be understood in order to design clinical trials. Respiratory parameters were not the primary outcome measures for the clinical trials. The impact of these therapies is described in subsequent clinical trial reports or real-world data. Genetic therapies are able to stabilize or improve the respiratory sequelae in patients with spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Standardized reporting of these outcomes is needed to help inform the future revisions of clinical standards of care and practice guidelines."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a neuromuscular disease caused by DMD gene mutations that result in an absence of functional dystrophin protein. Patients with Duchenne experience progressive muscle weakness, are typically wheelchair dependent by their early teens, and develop respiratory and cardiac complications that lead to death in their twenties or thirties. Becker muscular dystrophy is also caused by DMD gene mutations, but symptoms are less severe and progression is slower compared with Duchenne. We describe a case study of a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy who was still ambulant at age 61 years and had a milder phenotype than Duchenne, despite 46% of his DMD gene being missing. His affected relatives had similarly mild phenotypes and clinical courses. These data guided the understanding of the criticality of various regions of dystrophin and informed the development of micro-dystrophin constructs to compensate for the absence of functional dystrophin in Duchenne."

    "abstract": "Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of hereditary, neuromuscular disorder caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene resulting in the absence or production of truncated dystrophin protein. Conventionally, clinical descriptions of the disorder focus principally on striated muscle defects; however, DMD manifestations involving gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscle have been reported, even if not rigorously studied. The objective of the present review is to offer a comprehensive perspective on the existing knowledge concerning GI manifestations in DMD, focusing the attention on evidence in DMD patients and mdx mice. This includes an assessment of symptomatology, etiological pathways, and potential corrective approaches. This paper could provide helpful information about DMD gastrointestinal implications that could serve as a valuable orientation for prospective research endeavors in this field. This manuscript emphasizes the effectiveness of mdx mice, a DMD animal model, in unraveling mechanistic insights and exploring the pathological alterations in the GI tract. The gastrointestinal consequences evident in patients with DMD and the mdx mice models are a significant area of focus for researchers. The exploration of this area in depth could facilitate the development of more efficient therapeutic approaches and improve the well-being of individuals impacted by the condition."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare neuromuscular disorder diagnosed in childhood. Limited newborn screening in the US often delays diagnosis. With multiple FDA-approved therapies, early diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment but may entail other benefits and harms. Using a community-based survey, we explored how parents of siblings with DMD perceived early diagnosis of one child due to a prior child's diagnosis. We assessed parents' viewpoints across domains including diagnostic journey, treatment initiatives, service access, preparedness, parenting, emotional impact, and caregiving experience. We analyzed closed-ended responses on a -1.0 to +1.0 scale to measure the degree of harm or benefit parents perceived and analyzed open-ended responses thematically. A total of 45 parents completed the survey, with an average age of 43.5 years and 20.0% identifying as non-white. Younger siblings were diagnosed 2 years earlier on average (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Overall, parents viewed early diagnosis positively (mean: 0.39), particularly regarding school preparedness (+0.79), support services (+0.78), treatment evaluation (+0.68), and avoiding diagnostic odyssey (+0.67). Increased worry was a common downside (-0.40). Open-ended responses highlighted improved outlook and health management alongside heightened emotional distress and treatment burdens. These findings address gaps in the evidence by documenting the effectiveness of early screening and diagnosis of DMD using sibling data."

    "abstract": "To establish a haplotype-based noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) workflow for single-gene recessive disorders that adapt to dizygotic (DZ) twin pregnancies. Twin pregnancies at risk of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, hemophilia B, spinal muscular atrophy, phenylketonuria, and nonsyndromic hearing loss were recruited. For subsequent analysis, capture sequencing targeting highly heterozygotic single nucleotide polymorphism sites was conducted. Paternal-specific alleles were used to calculate the total and individual fetal fractions and determine zygosity. A two-step Bayes Factor model was applied to clarify the complex genomic landscape in the maternal plasma: the first step involved determining whether the twins inherited the same haplotype, and the second step involved estimating their individual genotypes. NIPT results were subsequently confirmed by invasive diagnosis. Nine twin pregnancies were recruited, including five DZ and four monozygotic (MZ) twins. The earliest gestational age was 8<sup>+0</sup> weeks, and the minimum fetal fraction was 4.6%. Three twin pregnancies were reported with one affected fetus, while the remaining six were reported without affected fetuses. Two dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies were confirmed to be MZ twins. The NIPT results were 100% consistent with those of invasive procedures or diagnostic genetic testing after birth. This study is the first to perform NIPT for single-gene disorders in twin pregnancies and preliminarily confirm its clinical feasibility. Acknowledging the twins' genotypes in the first trimester is valuable as it empowers obstetric care providers and parents to have adequate time for pregnancy management and decision-making."

    "abstract": "The dystrophin gene (<i>Dmd</i>) is recognized for its significance in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lethal and progressive skeletal muscle disease. Some patients with DMD and model mice with muscular dystrophy (mdx) spontaneously develop various types of tumors, among which rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most prominent. By contrast, spindle cell sarcoma (SCS) has rarely been reported in patients or mdx mice. In this study, we aimed to use metabolomics to better understand the rarity of SCS development in mdx mice. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to compare the metabolic profiles of spontaneously developed SCS and RMS tumors from mdx mice, and metabolite supplementation assays and silencing experiments were used to assess the effects of metabolic differences in SCS tumor-derived cells. The levels of 75 metabolites exhibited differences between RMS and SCS, 25 of which were significantly altered. Further characterization revealed downregulation of nonessential amino acids, including alanine, in SCS tumors. Alanine supplementation enhanced the growth, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and invasion of SCS cells. Reduction of intracellular alanine via knockdown of the alanine transporter Slc1a5 reduced the growth of SCS cells. Lower metabolite secretion and reduced proliferation of SCS tumors may explain the lower detection rate of SCS in mdx mice. Targeting of alanine depletion pathways may have potential as a novel treatment strategy.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> To the best of our knowledge, SCS has rarely been identified in patients with DMD or mdx mice. We observed that RMS and SCS tumors that spontaneously developed from mdx mice with the same <i>Dmd</i> genetic background exhibited differences in metabolic secretion. We proposed that, in addition to dystrophin deficiency, the levels of secreted metabolites may play a role in the determination of tumor-type development in a <i>Dmd-</i>deficient background."

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) to detect the deletion or duplication of DMD gene in prenatal diagnosis. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was carried out on the CNV-seq results of 34 544 fetuses diagnosed in the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province from January 2018 to July 2023. A total of 156 cases of fetuses were collected, including Group 1:125 cases with family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy or Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD), and Group 2:31 cases with no family history but a DMD gene deletion or duplication was detected unexpectedly by CNV-seq. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used as a standard method to detect the deletion or duplication. Consistency test was carried out basing on the results of CNV-seq and MLPA of all 156 cases. <b>Results:</b> Comparing to MLPA, CNV-seq had a coincidence rate of 92.3% (144/156) for DMD gene deletion or duplication, with a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 88.2%, with a specificity and negative predictive value of 94.3%, a missed detection rate of 3.8%, and a Kappa value of 0.839. CNV-seq missed 4 cases with deletions and 2 with duplications due to involved fragments less than 100 Kb, among 20 cases of deletions and 6 cases of duplications detected by MLPA in Group 1. In Group 2, the deletions and duplications detected by CNV-seq were 42% (13/31) and 58% (18/31), respectively, in which the percentage of duplication was higher than that in Group 1. Among those 18 cases with duplications, 3 cases with duplication locating in exon 42~67 were likely pathogenic; while 9 cases with duplication covering the 5' or 3' end of the DMD gene, containing exon 1 or 79 and with only one breakpoint within the gene, along with the last 6 cases with duplications locating at chrX: 32650635_32910000 detected only by CNV-seq, which might be judged as variants of uncertain significance. <b>Conclusions:</b> CNV-seq has a good efficiency to detect fetal DMD gene deletion or duplication in prenatal diagnosis, while a further verification test by MLPA is recommended. The duplications on chrX: 32650635_32910000, 5' or 3' end of DMD gene detected by CNV-seq should be carefully verified and assessed because those variants appear to be nonpathogenic polymorphisms."

To compare SV95C-in its first-ever clinical trial application as a secondary endpoint-with established motor function COAs used in the trial (Four-Stair Climb [4SC] velocity, North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA], and Six-Minute Walk Distance [6MWD]). SV95C was a secondary endpoint in a subset (n = 47) of participants in the SPITFIRE/WN40227 trial of taldefgrobep alfa, which was discontinued due to lack of clinical benefit. Participants in the ≤48-week SV95C sub-study were 6-11 years old and received corticosteroids for ≥6 months pre-treatment. Pearson correlations were used to compare SV95C with the other COAs. Responsiveness and changes over time were respectively assessed via standardized response means (SRMs) based on absolute changes and mixed models for repeated measures. SV95C change at Week 24 was -0.07 m/s, with limited variability (standard deviation: 0.16, n = 27). The SRM for SV95C indicated moderate responsiveness to clinical change at the earliest timepoint (Week 12, n = 46), while those of the other COAs did not indicate moderate responsiveness until Week 36 (6MWD, n = 33) or Week 48 (4SC velocity, n = 20; NSAA total score, n = 20). Baseline correlations between SV95C and other COAs were strong (r = 0.611-0.695). Correlations between SV95C change from baseline to Week 48 and changes in other COAs were moderate to strong (r = 0.443-0.678).∥. Overall, SV95C demonstrated sensitivity to ambulatory decline over short intervals, low variability, and correlation with established COAs. Although the negative trial precluded demonstration of SV95C's sensitivity to drug effect, these findings support the continued use of SV95C in DMD clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Functional activities are extensively used in motor assessments of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The role of timed items has been reported as an early prognostic factor for disease progression. However, there are two functional activities that are not widely assessed in clinical practice among Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients: rolling and bed rising. This study aimed to investigate whether the 360-degree roll (roll) and supine to sit-to-edge (bed rise) measurements are feasible tools reflecting the functional status of ambulatory DMD children by establishing possible correlations between validated measures: the Vignos Scale (VS), timed rise from floor and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). A total of 32 ambulant boys with DMD were assessed using timed items, the 6MWT and VS. The roll and bed rise are correlated with each other. The 6MWT, the floor rise and VS are correlated with the roll and with the bed rise. Findings offer preliminary empirical evidence addressing feasibility and safety of roll and bed rise measurements. There is a potential clinical utility of these tests in assessing functional status of DMD ambulant patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients exhibit a late left ventricular systolic dysfunction preceded by an occult phase, during which myocardial fibrosis progresses and some early functional impairments can be detected. These latter include electrocardiographic (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) abnormalities. This longitudinal study aimed at describing the sequence of ECG and HRV abnormalities, using Holter ECG in the GRMD (Golden retriever muscular dystrophy) dog model, known to develop a DMD-like disease, including cardiomyopathy. Most of the known ECG abnormalities described in DMD patients were also found in GRMD dogs, including increased heart rate, prolonged QT and shortened PR intervals, ventricular arrhythmias, and several of them could be detected months before the decrease of fractional shortening. The HRV was impaired like in DMD patients, one of the earliest evidenced abnormalities being a decrease in the very low frequency (VLF) component of the power spectrum. This decrease was correlated with the further reduction of fractional shortening. Such decreased VLF probably reflects impaired autonomic function and abnormal vasomotor tone. This study provides new insights into the knowledge of the GRMD dog model and DMD cardiomyopathy and emphasizes the interest to monitor the VLF power in DMD patients, still unexplored in this disease, whilst it is highly predictive of deleterious clinical events in many other pathological conditions."

The present study further used clustering algorithms for the texture reconstruction of ultrasound images of DMD data sets and analyzed the difference in echo intensity between disease stages. k-means (Kms) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms were used to reconstruct the DMD data-set textures. Each image was reconstructed using seven texture-feature categories, six of which were used as the primary analysis items. The task of automatically identifying the ambulatory function and DMD severity was performed by establishing a machine-learning model. The experimental results indicated that the Gaussian Naïve Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classification models achieved an accuracy of 86.78% in ambulatory function classification. The decision-tree model achieved an identification accuracy of 83.80% in severity classification. A deep convolutional neural network model was established as the main structure of the deep-learning model while automatic auxiliary interpretation tasks of ambulatory function and severity were performed, and data augmentation was used to improve the recognition performance of the trained model. Both the visual geometry group (VGG)-16 and VGG-19 models achieved 98.53% accuracy in ambulatory-function classification. The VGG-19 model achieved 92.64% accuracy in severity classification. Regarding the overall results, the Kms and FCM clustering algorithms were used in this study to reconstruct the characteristic texture of the gastrocnemius muscle group in DMD, which was indeed helpful in quantitatively analyzing the deterioration of the gastrocnemius muscle group in patients with DMD at different stages. Subsequent combination of machine-learning and deep-learning technologies can automatically and accurately assist in identifying DMD symptoms and tracking DMD deterioration for long-term observation."

The aim of this study was to explore the respiratory-related comorbidities, and the effect of these comorbidities and treatments on life expectancy and causes of death. All male patients living in Sweden with DMD, born and deceased 1970-2019, were included. Data regarding causes of death were collected from the Cause of Death Registry and cross-checked with the medical records along with diagnostics and relevant clinical features. Hundred and twenty nine patients were included with a median lifespan of 24.3 years. Acute respiratory failure accounted for 63.3% of respiratory-related causes of death. 70.1% suffered at least one pneumonia, with first episode at a median age of 17.8 years. Hypoventilation was found in 73.0% with onset at 18.1 years. 60.5% had their first pneumonia before established hypoventilation. Age at onset of hypoventilation showed a strong correlation with age at first pneumonia. First pneumonia and scoliosis non-treated with scoliosis surgery increased the risk of dying of respiratory-related causes. In 10% of the patients, first pneumonia resulted in acute tracheostomy or early death. Patients treated with assisted ventilation had higher life expectancy compared to untreated patients. Our results highlight the importance of identifying subclinical hypoventilation in a timely manner and the importance of an active treatment regime upon clinical signs of pneumonia."

DMD is a devastating genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Skeletal muscle degeneration is induced by a genetic disorder. It is a common X-linked condition that causes hypertrophy of the calves and proximal muscular weakness in children. It frequently results in early mortality, wheelchair confinement, and delays in motor development. Physiotherapy interventions aim to optimize functional abilities and quality of life in individuals with DMD. This case report highlights the effectiveness of physiotherapy in managing DMD progression. This study presents a case exhibiting notable clinical symptoms, highlighting the urgency for advanced treatments to combat this debilitating disease. Outcome measures such as body mass index, spirometry, manual muscle testing, and the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life scale are used to report patient progress. The treatment plan was carried out for six weeks, five times a week. Physiotherapy strategies include diet management, stretching and splinting techniques, and pulmonary training. While current treatments focus on symptom management, ongoing research holds promise for the development of more effective therapies to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals. Multidisciplinary care, including neurophysiotherapy rehabilitation, plays a crucial role in managing the symptoms and complications of DMD, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive support for patients and their families. At the end of our rehabilitation, the patient showed significant improvement in the outcome measures."

    "abstract": "As one of the most common congenital abnormalities in male births, cryptorchidism has been found to have a polygenic aetiology according to previous studies of common variants. However, little is known about genetic predisposition of rare variants for cryptorchidism, since rare variants have larger effective size on diseases than common variants. In this study, a cohort of 115 Chinese probands with cryptorchidism was analysed using whole-genome sequencing, alongside 19 parental controls and 2136 unaffected men. Additionally, CRISPR-Cas9 editing of a conserved variant was performed in a mouse model, with MRI screening used to observe the phenotype. In 30 of 115 patients (26.1%), we identified four novel genes (<i>ARSH</i>, <i>DMD</i>, <i>MAGEA4</i> and <i>SHROOM2</i>) affecting at least five unrelated patients and four known genes (<i>USP9Y</i>, <i>UBA1</i>, <i>BCORL1</i> and <i>KDM6A</i>) with the candidate rare pathogenic variants affecting at least two cases. Burden tests of rare variants revealed the genome-wide significances for newly identified genes (p<2.5×10<sup>-6</sup>) under the Bonferroni correction. Surprisingly, novel and known genes were mainly found on X chromosome (seven on X and one on Y) and all rare X-chromosomal segregating variants exhibited a maternal inheritance rather than de novo origin. CRISPR-Cas9 mouse modelling of a splice donor loss variant in <i>DMD</i> (NC_000023.11:g.32454661C>G), which resides in a conserved site across vertebrates, replicated bilateral cryptorchidism phenotypes, confirmed by MRI at 4 and 10 weeks. The movement tests further revealed symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in transgenic mice. Our results revealed the role of the <i>DMD</i> gene mutation in causing cryptorchidism. The results also suggest that maternal-X inheritance of pathogenic defects could have a predominant role in the development of cryptorchidism."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle's regenerative ability is vital for maintaining muscle function, but chronic diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy can deplete this capacity. Muscle satellite cells, quiescent in normal situations, are activated during muscle injury, expressing myogenic regulatory factors, and producing myogenic progenitor cells. It was reported that muscle stem cells in primary culture and reserve cells in C2C12 cells express anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Although the role of Bcl-2 expressed in myogenic cells has been thought to be to enhance cell viability, we hypothesized that Bcl-2 may promote the formation of reserve cells. The expression pattern analysis showed the expression of Bcl-2 in undifferentiated mononucleated cells, emphasizing its usefulness as a reserve cell marker and reminding us that cells expressing Bcl-2 have low proliferative potential. Silencing of Bcl-2 by transfection with siRNA decreased cell viability and the number of reserve cells, while overexpression of Bcl-2 not only increases cell viability but also inhibits muscle differentiation and proliferation. These results emphasize dual roles of Bcl-2 in protecting cells from apoptosis and contributing to reserve cell formation by regulating myoblast proliferation and/or differentiation. Overall, the study sheds light on the multifaceted role of Bcl-2 in the maintenance of skeletal muscle regeneration."

We found 2 novel high-impact variants: a 1-bp deletion in felCat9 and an identical nonsense variant in felCat9 and AnAms1.0. Whole genome and Sanger sequencing validation showed that the deletion in felCat9 was a false positive because of misassembly. Among the 357 cats, the nonsense variant was only found in the affected cat, which indicated it was a de novo variant. We identified a de novo variant in the affected cat and next-generation sequencing-based genotyping of the whole DMD gene was determined to be necessary for affected cats because the parents of the affected cat did not have the risk variant."

Clinical data were collected from the prospective and longitudinal ImagingNMD study. Disease progression models were developed by a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. Univariate models of 6MWD and MRI-T<sub>2</sub> of five muscles were developed separately. Age at assessment was the time metric. Multivariate models were developed by estimating the correlation of 6MWD and MRI-T<sub>2</sub> model variables. Full model estimation approach for covariate analysis and five-fold cross validation were conducted. Simulations were performed to compare the models and predict the covariate effects on the trajectories of 6MWD and MRI-T<sub>2</sub>.

Steroid use, baseline 6MWD, and baseline MRI-T<sub>2</sub> were significant covariates. The median age at which 6MWD is half of its maximum decrease in the five models was similar, while the median age at which MRI-T<sub>2</sub> is half of its maximum increase varied depending on the type of muscle. The models connecting 6MWD and MRI-T<sub>2</sub> successfully quantified how individual characteristics alter disease trajectories. The models demonstrate a plausible correlation between 6MWD and MRI-T<sub>2</sub>, supporting the use of MRI-T<sub>2</sub>.

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, degenerative, recessive X-linked neuromuscular disease. Mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin lead to the absence of functional dystrophin protein. Individuals living with DMD exhibit progressive muscle weakness resulting in loss of ambulation and limb function, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy, with multiorgan involvement. Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated gene therapy designed to enable production of functional dystrophin protein is a new therapeutic strategy. Delandistrogene moxeparvovec (Sarepta Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA) is indicated for treatment of ambulatory pediatric patients aged 4 through 5 years with DMD who have an indicated mutation in the DMD gene. Evidence-based considerations for management of potential adverse events following gene therapy treatment for DMD are lacking in clinical literature. Our goal was to provide interdisciplinary consensus considerations for selected treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) (vomiting, acute liver injury, myocarditis, and immune-mediated myositis) that may arise following gene therapy dosing with delandistrogene moxeparvovec. An interdisciplinary panel of 12 specialists utilized a modified Delphi process to develop consensus considerations for the evaluation and management of TRAEs reported in delandistrogene moxeparvovec clinical studies. Panelists completed 2 Questionnaires prior to gathering for an in-person discussion. Consensus was defined as a majority (≥58% ; 7/12) of panelists either agreeing or disagreeing. Panelists agreed that the choice of baseline assessments should be informed by individual clinical indications, the treating provider's judgment, and prescribing information. Corticosteroid dosing for treatment of TRAEs should be optimized by considering individual risk versus benefit for each indication. In all cases involving patients with a confirmed TRAE, consultations with appropriate specialists were suggested. The Delphi Panel established consensus considerations for the evaluation and management of potential TRAEs for patients receiving delandistrogene moxeparvovec, including vomiting, acute liver injury, myocarditis, and immune-mediated myositis."

Participants were 7 patients with DMD and 8 healthy males, whose physical activity and HRV were provided by a wearable device. These data were used to investigate the relationship between both physical activity and HRV parameters and timed motor functional tests [Time to stand from supine, 10-meter walking time (10MWT), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), and 6-minute walking test (6MWT)] in patients with DMD. Results of 24-hours physical activity, fat burning, total number of steps and active distance, average step rate, average exercise intensity during walking, exercise, degree of forward lean during walking, maximum heart rate, normalized low frequency power (LF norm), and maximum exercise intensity in patients with DMD were lower than those in control subjects. Physical activity and HRV parameters did not correlate with the time to stand from supine. The 10MWT positively correlated with average heart rate, while NSAA negatively correlated with average heart rate, total frequency power (TF), and very low frequency power (VLF) during arousal. The 6MWT negatively correlated with ratio LF/high frequency power (HF). Physical activity and HRV indices that differ from those of normal children and that correlate with motor function assessment may serve as digital biomarkers."

    "title": "Mitochondria and Reactive Oxygen Species: The Therapeutic Balance of Powers for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic progressive muscle-wasting disorder that leads to rapid loss of mobility and premature death. The absence of functional dystrophin in DMD patients reduces sarcolemma stiffness and increases contraction damage, triggering a cascade of events leading to muscle cell degeneration, chronic inflammation, and deposition of fibrotic and adipose tissue. Efforts in the last decade have led to the clinical approval of novel drugs for DMD that aim to restore dystrophin function. However, combination therapies able to restore dystrophin expression and target the myriad of cellular events found impaired in dystrophic muscle are desirable. Muscles are higher energy consumers susceptible to mitochondrial defects. Mitochondria generate a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and they are, in turn, sensitive to proper redox balance. In both DMD patients and animal models there is compelling evidence that mitochondrial impairments have a key role in the failure of energy homeostasis. Here, we highlighted the main aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in DMD and discussed the recent findings linked to mitochondria/ROS-targeted molecules as a therapeutic approach. In this respect, dual targeting of both mitochondria and redox homeostasis emerges as a potential clinical option in DMD."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating monogenic skeletal muscle-wasting disorder. Although many pharmacological and genetic interventions have been reported in preclinical studies, few have progressed to clinical trials with meaningful benefit. Identifying therapeutic potential can be limited by availability of suitable preclinical mouse models. More rigorous testing across models with varied background strains and mutations can identify treatments for clinical success. Here, we report the generation of a DMD mouse model with a CRISPR-induced deletion within exon 62 of the dystrophin gene (Dmd) and the first generated in BALB/c mice. Analysis of mice at 3, 6 and 12 months of age confirmed loss of expression of the dystrophin protein isoform Dp427 and resultant dystrophic pathology in limb muscles and the diaphragm, with evidence of centrally nucleated fibers, increased inflammatory markers and fibrosis, progressive decline in muscle function, and compromised trabecular bone development. The BALB/c.mdx62 mouse is a novel model of DMD with associated variations in the immune response and muscle phenotype, compared with those of existing models. It represents an important addition to the preclinical model toolbox for developing therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a rare inherited neuromuscular disease. At first, cardiac involvement may be asymptomatic. Therefore, assessing patients using non-invasive methods can help detect any changes. Analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) test and heart rate variability (HRV) of the DMD group and compare the information with that of the age-matched control group. A prospective study with 27 male patients with DMD (11.9 years old), who underwent clinical evaluation, ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitoring. ECG (200% increase) was assessed by two independent observers. HRV was measured over time (24 h) and in the frequency domain, in the supine and sitting positions. The healthy group consisted of nine patients (11.0 years old). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean ejection fraction (EF) was 60% (34 to 71%). The Kappa coefficient for ECG measurements ranged from 0.64 to 1.00. An increase in the R/S ratio in V1 was observed in 25.9% of the subjects, pathological Q wave in 29.6%, and fragmented QRS in 22.2% in inferior/high lateral regions, with a negative correlation with EF (p = 0.006). There was low HRV, without the influence of any variable, including treatment. With the change in position, there was an increase in HR (p = 0.004), but there was no change in HRV. The LF/HF ratio was 2.7 in the DMD group and 0.7 in the control group (p = 0.002). In DMD subjects, prominent R waves in V1 and changes in the inferior/high lateral regions occurred in almost 30% of the cases. Lower vagal tone was observed without the influence of the variables age, ejection fraction, QT dispersion, and treatment. Despite the increase in HR, there was no adequate HRV response to the change in position."

Various DMD mutations result in different phenotypes and disease severity. Understanding genotype/phenotype correlations is essential to optimize clinical care, as mutation-specific therapies and innovative therapeutic approaches are becoming available. Disease modifier genes, trans-active variants influencing disease severity and phenotypic expressivity, may modulate the response to therapy, and become new therapeutic targets. Uncovering more disease modifier genes via extensive genomic mapping studies offers the potential to fine-tune prognostic assessments for individuals with DMD. This review provides insights into genotype/phenotype correlations and the influence of modifier genes in DMD."

CRISPR-Cas-mediated gene knockout has already become a routine method in research laboratories. However, in the last few years, accumulating evidences have demonstrated that genes knocked out by CRISPR-Cas may not be truly silenced. Functional residual proteins could be generated in such knockout organisms to compensate the putative loss of function, termed herein knockout escaping. In line with this, several CRISPR-Cas-mediated knockout screenings have discovered much less abnormal phenotypes than expected. How does knockout escaping happen and how often does it happen have not been systematically reviewed yet. Without knowing this, knockout results could easily be misinterpreted. In this review, we summarize these evidences and propose two main mechanisms allowing knockout escaping. To avoid the confusion caused by knockout escaping, several strategies are discussed as well as their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, knockout escaping also provides convenient tools for studying essential genes and treating monogenic disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which are discussed in the end."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD MIM#310200) is a degenerative muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene located on Xp21.2. The clinical features encompass muscle weakness and markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels. An 8-year-old Chinese boy was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Whole exome gene sequencing was conducted and the Sanger method was used to validate sequencing. A deletion (c.5021del) in exon 35 of the dystrophin gene was identified, which was predicted to generate a frameshift mutation and create an early termination codon (p.Leu1674CysfsTer47). It has a pathogenic effect against dystrophin in the muscle cell membrane of the patient. As such, prednisone treatment at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg.d was administered. After one month, a notable reduction in fall frequency was observed. Our new finding will expand the pathogenic mutation spectrum causing DMD."

Women carrying dystrophin gene mutations are commonly <i>unaffected</i> because the wild X allele may produce a sufficient amount of the dystrophin protein. However, approximately 8-10% of them may experience muscle symptoms and 50% of those over 40 years develop cardiomyopathy. The presence of symptoms defines the individual as an affected \"<i>symptomatic</i> or <i>manifesting</i> carrier\". Though there is no effective cure for DMD, therapies are available to slow the decline of muscle strength and delay the onset and progression of cardiac and respiratory impairment. These include ataluren for patients with nonsense mutations, and antisense oligonucleotides therapies, for patients with specific deletions. Symptomatic DMD female carriers are not included in these indications and little data documenting their management, often entrusted to the discretion of individual doctors, is present in the literature. In this article, we report the clinical and instrumental outcomes of four symptomatic DMD carriers, aged between 26 and 45 years, who were treated with ataluren for 21 to 73 months (average 47.3), and annually evaluated for muscle strength, respiratory and cardiological function. Two patients retain independent ambulation at ages 33 and 45, respectively. None of them developed respiratory involvement or cardiomyopathy.

In addition to developing cardiomyopathy, patients with DMD have been reported to be susceptible to the development of symptomatic hypotension, although the mechanisms are unclear. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data has identified potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 5 (KCNQ5) and possibly ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) as potential candidate hypotension genes whose expression is significantly upregulated in the vascular smooth muscle cells of DMD mutant mice. We hypothesize that heightened KCNQ5 and RyR2 expression contributes to decreased arterial blood pressure in patients with DMD. Exploring pharmacological approaches to inhibit the KCNQ5 and RyR2 channels holds promise in managing the systemic hypotension observed in individuals with DMD. This avenue of investigation presents new prospects for improving clinical outcomes for these patients."

Increased cardiomyocyte cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and interstitial fibrosis are major pathophysiological hallmarks that ultimately result in cardiac dysfunction. MicroRNA-25 (miR-25) has been identified as a suppressor of both sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog-7 (Smad7) proteins. In this study, we created a gene transfer using an miR-25 tough decoy (TuD) RNA inhibitor delivered via recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) to evaluate the effect of miR-25 inhibition on cardiac and skeletal muscle function in aged dystrophin/utrophin haploinsufficient mice <i>mdx/utrn</i> (<i>+/-</i>), a validated transgenic murine model of DMD. We found that the intravenous delivery of AAV9 miR-25 TuD resulted in strong and stable inhibition of cardiac miR-25 levels, together with the restoration of SERCA2a and Smad7 expression. This was associated with the amelioration of cardiomyocyte interstitial fibrosis as well as recovered cardiac function. Furthermore, the direct quadricep intramuscular injection of AAV9 miR-25 TuD significantly restored skeletal muscle Smad7 expression, reduced tissue fibrosis, and enhanced skeletal muscle performance in <i>mdx/utrn</i> (+/-) mice. These results imply that miR-25 TuD gene transfer may be a novel therapeutic approach to restore cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and abrogate tissue fibrosis in DMD."

Tissue decellularization removes cellular components while leaving behind ECM components. We generated \"on-slide\" decellularized tissue slices from genetically distinct dystrophic mouse models. The ECM of dystrophin- and sarcoglycan-deficient muscles had marked thrombospondin 4 deposition, while dysferlin-deficient muscle had excess decorin. Annexins A2 and A6 were present on all dystrophic decellularized ECMs, but annexin matrix deposition was excessive in dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Muscle-directed viral expression of annexin A6 resulted in annexin A6 in the ECM. C2C12 myoblasts seeded onto decellularized matrices displayed differential myoblast mobility and fusion. Dystrophin-deficient decellularized matrices inhibited myoblast mobility, while dysferlin-deficient decellularized matrices enhanced myoblast movement and differentiation. Myoblasts treated with recombinant annexin A6 increased mobility and fusion like that seen on dysferlin-deficient decellularized matrix and demonstrated upregulation of ECM and muscle cell differentiation genes.

Here we discuss the results form an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study to characterize the currently authorised orphan medicinal products (OMP) and orphan designations (OD) given to products for PERAN in the last two decades. In the EU about half of PERAN diseases have at least one active OD approved since 2000, and about half of these are for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The large majority of PERAN diseases do not have an authorised medicine with only 6 OMP currently authorised for Spinal muscular atrophy (3); DMD (1) and Myasthenia gravis (2). One in five products have inactive or discontinued regulatory development but clinical trials are ongoing for the vast majority of PERAN diseases, and more than half are in the final stage of clinical research with significantly more products with medical plausibility based in clinical data reaching advanced stages in clinical development."

Among a pool of 40 BMD patients and 20 healthy controls, Sartorius and gracilis muscles were selected on the basis of a blinded clinical quantitative/qualitative evaluation, if classified as normal (0 or 1 on Mercuri scale) and subsequently segmented on diffusion tensor MRI scans with a tractographic approach. Diffusion derived parameters were extracted. Non-parametric testing revealed significant differences between normal and normal appearing BMD derived parameters in both muscles, the difference being more evident in sartorius. Bonferroni-corrected P-values (<.05) of Mann-Whitney test could discriminate between BMD and controls for standard deviation of all diffusion parameters (mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity) in both sartorius and gracilis, while in sartorius the significant difference was found also in the average values of the same parameters (with exception of RD).

Here, we investigated whether adenine base editing can correct pathological nonsense point mutations leading to premature stop codons in the dystrophin gene. We identified 27 causative nonsense mutations in our DMD patient cohort. Treatment with adenine base editor (ABE) could restore dystrophin expression by direct A-to-G editing of pathological nonsense mutations in cardiomyocytes generated from DMD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We also generated two humanized mouse models of DMD expressing mutation-bearing exons 23 or 30 of human dystrophin gene. Intramuscular administration of ABE, driven by ubiquitous or muscle-specific promoters could correct these nonsense mutations <i>in vivo</i>, albeit with higher efficiency in exon 30, restoring dystrophin expression in skeletal fibers of humanized DMD mice. Moreover, a single systemic delivery of ABE with human single guide RNA (sgRNA) could induce body-wide dystrophin expression and improve muscle function in rotarod tests of humanized DMD mice. These findings demonstrate that ABE with human sgRNAs can confer therapeutic alleviation of DMD in mice, providing a basis for development of adenine base editing therapies in monogenic diseases."

The aim of this prospective, cohort study was to describe the occurrence and nature of cardiac arrhythmias recorded during prolonged continuous ECG rhythm surveillance in patients with established cardiac dystrophinopathy and relate them to abnormalities on cardiac MRI. A cohort of 10 patients (36.3 years; 3 female) with LVEF<40% due to Duchenne (3) or Becker muscular (4) dystrophy or Duchenne muscular dystrophy-gene carrying effects in females (3) were recruited, had cardiac MRI, ECG signal-averaging and ECG loop-recorder implants. All were on standard of care heart medications and none had prior history of arrhythmias.No deaths or brady arrhythmias occurred during median follow-up 30 months (range 13-35). Self-limiting episodes of asymptomatic tachyarrhythmia (range 1-29) were confirmed in 8 (80%) patients (ventricular only 2; ventricular and atrial 6). Higher ventricular arrhythmia burden correlated with extent of myocardial fibrosis (extracellular volume%, p=0.029; native T1, p=0.49; late gadolinium enhancement, p=0.49), but not with LVEF% (p=1.0) on MRI and atrial arrhythmias with left atrial dilatation. Features of VT episodes suggested various underlying arrhythmia mechanisms. The overall prevalence of arrhythmias was low. Even in such a small sample size, higher arrhythmia counts occurred in those with larger scar burden and greater ventricular volume, suggesting key roles for myocardial stretch as well as disease progression in arrhythmogenesis. These features overlap with the stage of left ventricular dysfunction when heart failure also becomes overt. The findings of this pilot study should help inform the design of a definitive study of specific antiarrhythmic management in dystrophinopathy. ISRCTN15622536."

Knockdown of Drp1 (Drp1-KD) promoted mitochondrial hyperfusion in the muscle of male mice. Reduced fatty acid oxidation and impaired insulin action along with increased muscle succinate was observed in Drp1-KD muscle. Muscle Drp1-KD reduced complex II assembly and activity as a consequence of diminished mitochondrial translocation of succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2 (Sdhaf2). Restoration of Sdhaf2 normalized complex II activity, lipid oxidation, and insulin action in Drp1-KD myocytes. Drp1 is critical in maintaining mitochondrial complex II assembly, lipid oxidation, and insulin sensitivity, suggesting a mechanistic link between mitochondrial morphology and skeletal muscle metabolism, which is clinically relevant in combatting metabolic-related diseases."

Germline reduction of SLN expression in mdx:utrn-/- mice improved cardiac sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ cycling, reduced cardiac fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. At the cellular level, reducing SLN expression prevented mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and improved mitochondrial function. Transmission electron microscopy of myocardial tissues and proteomic analysis of mitochondria-associated membranes showed that reducing SLN expression improved mitochondrial structure and SR-mitochondria interactions in dystrophic cardiomyocytes. These findings indicate that SLN upregulation plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy and that reducing SLN expression has clinical implications in the treatment of DMD cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, the progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, is observed in various conditions, including cancer and aging. The complex molecular biology of sarcopenia has posed challenges for the development of FDA-approved medications, which have mainly focused on dietary supplementation. Targeting a single gene may not be sufficient to address the broad range of processes involved in muscle loss. This study analyzed the gene expression signatures associated with cancer formation and 5-FU chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting. Our findings suggest that dimenhydrinate, a combination of 8-chlorotheophylline and diphenhydramine, is a potential therapeutic for sarcopenia. In vitro experiments demonstrated that dimenhydrinate promotes muscle progenitor cell proliferation through the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by 8-chlorotheophylline and promotes myotube formation through diphenhydramine-induced autophagy. Furthermore, in various in vivo sarcopenia models, dimenhydrinate induced rapid muscle tissue regeneration. It improved muscle regeneration in animals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and facilitated muscle and fat recovery in animals with chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia. As an FDA-approved drug, dimenhydrinate could be applied for sarcopenia treatment after a relatively short development period, providing hope for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an intractable X-linked myopathy caused by dystrophin gene mutations. Patients with DMD suffer from progressive muscle weakness, inevitable cardiomyopathy, increased heart rate (HR), and decreased blood pressure (BP). The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy and tolerability of ivabradine treatment for DMD cardiomyopathy.A retrospective analysis was performed in 11 patients with DMD, who received ivabradine treatment for more than 1 year. Clinical results were analyzed before (baseline), 6 months after, and 12 months after the ivabradine administration.The initial ivabradine dose was 2.0 ± 1.2 mg/day and the final dose was 5.6 ± 4.0 mg/day. The baseline BP was 95/64 mmHg. A non-significant BP decrease to 90/57 mmHg was observed at 1 month but it recovered to 97/62 mmHg at 12 months after ivabradine administration. The baseline HR was 93 ± 6 bpm and it decreased to 74 ± 12 bpm at 6 months (P = 0.011), and to 77 ± 10 bpm at 12 months (P = 0.008). A linear correlation (y = 2.2x + 5.1) was also observed between the ivabradine dose (x mg/day) and HR decrease (y bpm). The baseline LVEF was 38 ± 12% and it significantly increased to 42 ± 9% at 6 months (P = 0.011) and to 41 ± 11% at 12 months (P = 0.038). Only 1 patient with the lowest BMI of 11.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and BP of 79/58 mmHg discontinued ivabradine treatment at 6 months, while 1-year administration was well-tolerated in the other 10 patients.Ivabradine decreased HR and increased LVEF without lowering BP, suggesting it can be a treatment option for DMD cardiomyopathy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most frequent childhood dystrophies, affecting cardiopulmonary functions and walking ability. One of the main symptoms is fatigue, which is caused by altered muscle metabolism related to energy expenditure (EE). Aquatic physiotherapy is a therapeutic modality that facilitates the maintenance of this posture because of immersion on the body. This cross-sectional observational study aimed to compare the EE on the ground and water of individuals with DMD through oxygen consumption in the maintenance of sitting posture. The individuals were in a sitting position on the ground and in the water for 20 min for the assessments. The variables peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, maximum expiratory pressure, maximum inspiratory pressure, forced vital capacity, respiratory quotient (RQ), and oxygen consumption per kilogram of body weight (VO<sub>2</sub> /kg) were compared, adopting a significance of 5 %. No difference was found between medians and quartiles of RQ when comparing the two environments. The same was observed for VO<sub>2</sub> /Kg values on the ground and in water. The data from this study demonstrate that the EE of individuals with DMD did not change when maintaining a sitting posture on the ground and in water."

    "abstract": "The rapidly evolving clinical landscape of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is driving innovative approaches for early diagnosis through genomic newborn bloodspot screening (NBS). However, the potential impact of these programs on families and healthcare systems remains unexplored. This study assessed the perceived benefits, harms, barriers, and enablers for DMD NBS amongst primary caregivers of children with DMD and healthcare professionals (HCPs). This Australian multi-centre cross-sectional study used a mixed-methods convergent methodology. Participants completed a codeveloped questionnaire and their perceptions on the utility, model of care, and processes of DMD NBS were thematically analysed. Participants included 50 caregivers and 26 HCPs (68.5% and 53.1% response rate respectively). Most caregivers (40/50, 80%) perceived net benefits of DMD NBS and highlighted an early diagnosis as actionable knowledge, even with the current paucity of disease modifying therapies. This knowledge was valued to enable access to multidisciplinary supportive care (29/50, 58%), clinical trials (27/50, 54%), psychological support (28/50, 56%), inform reproductive planning (27/50, 54%), and facilitate financial planning based on the future needs of their child (27/50, 54%). Whilst HCPs acknowledged these opportunities, only 16/26 (61.5%) believed there were definite net benefits, with notable concerns over the psychological harms of diagnostic knowledge without a recourse to disease modifying therapeutic intervention early in life. Caregivers and HCPs perceived a range of potential benefits of DMD NBS. Health system readiness will be founded on developing an integrated model of care that not only supports the psychosocial and information needs of families receiving a newborn diagnosis of DMD, but also provides care and clinical surveillance for individuals for whom a diagnosis may remain uncertain.

    "abstract": "The resolution of inflammation is the primary domain of specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which include resolvins, protectins, and their forms synthesised under the influence of aspirin and the maresins. The role of these SPMs has been discussed by many authors in the literature, with particular reference to neuroinflammation and significant neurological disorders. This review discusses the role of G protein-coupled receptor 18 (GPR18), resolvin D2 (RvD2) activity, and the GPR18-RvD2 signalling axis, as well as the role of small molecule ligands of GPR18 in inflammation in various health disorders (brain injuries, neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative/cardiometabolic/cardiovascular/gastrointestinal diseases, peritonitis, periodontitis, asthma and lung inflammation, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, and placenta disorders. The idea of biological intervention through modulating GPR18 signalling is attracting growing attention because of its great therapeutic potential. With this paper, we aimed to present a comprehensive review of the most recent literature, perform a constructive view of data, and point out research gaps."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by loss of the dystrophin protein. This pathology is accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to muscle fiber instability. It is known that mitochondria-targeted in vivo therapy mitigates pathology and improves the quality of life of model animals. In the present work, we applied mitochondrial transplantation therapy (MTT) to correct the pathology in dystrophin-deficient <i>mdx</i> mice. Intramuscular injections of allogeneic mitochondria obtained from healthy animals into the hind limbs of <i>mdx</i> mice alleviated skeletal muscle injury, reduced calcium deposits in muscles and serum creatine kinase levels, and improved the grip strength of the hind limbs and motor activity of recipient <i>mdx</i> mice. We noted normalization of the mitochondrial ultrastructure and sarcoplasmic reticulum/mitochondria interactions in <i>mdx</i> muscles. At the same time, we revealed a decrease in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle mitochondria of recipient <i>mdx</i> mice accompanied by a reduction in lipid peroxidation products (MDA products) and reduced calcium overloading. We found no effect of MTT on the expression of mitochondrial signature genes (<i>Drp1</i>, <i>Mfn2</i>, <i>Ppargc1a</i>, <i>Pink1</i>, <i>Parkin</i>) and on the level of mtDNA. Our results show that systemic MTT mitigates the development of destructive processes in the quadriceps muscle of <i>mdx</i> mice."

We introduced a novel human Dystrophin Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cell therapy of myoblast origin and confirmed the safety and efficacy of DEC in the <i>mdx</i> mouse models of DMD. In this study, we assessed histological and morphological changes in the cardiac, diaphragm, and gastrocnemius muscles of the <i>mdx</i>/<i>scid</i> mice after the transplantation of human DEC therapy via the systemic-intraosseous route. The efficacy of different DEC doses was evaluated at 90 days (0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> DEC cells) and 180 days (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> DEC cells) after administration. The evaluation of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained sectional slices of cardiac, diaphragm, and gastrocnemius muscles included assessment of muscle fiber size by minimal Feret's diameter method using ImageJ software. The overall improvement in muscle morphology was observed in DMD-affected target muscles in both studies, as evidenced by a shift in fiber size distribution toward the wild type (WT) phenotype and by an increase in the mean Feret's diameter compared to the vehicle-injected controls. These findings confirm the long-term efficacy of human DEC therapy in the improvement of overall morphological pathology in the muscles affected by DMD and introduce DEC as a novel therapeutic approach for DMD patients."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin. These mutations lead to progressive functional deterioration including muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and musculoskeletal deformities. Three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA) has been used as a tool to analyze gait pathology through the quantification of altered joint kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity patterns. Among 3DGA indices, the Gait Profile Score (GPS), has been used as a sensitive overall measure to detect clinically relevant changes in gait patterns in children with DMD. To enhance our understanding of the clinical translation of 3DGA, we report here the development of a population nonlinear mixed-effect model that jointly describes the disease progression of the 3DGA index, GPS, and the functional endpoint, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA). The final model consists of a quadratic structure for GPS progression and a linear structure for GPS-NSAA correlation. Our model was able to capture the improvement in function in GPS and NSAA in younger subjects, as well as the decline of function in older subjects. Furthermore, the model predicted NSAA (CFB) at 1 year reasonably well for DMD subjects ≤7 years old at baseline. The model tended to slightly underpredict the decline in NSAA after 1 year for those >7 years old at baseline, but the prediction summary statistics were well maintained within the standard deviation of observed data. Quantitative models such as this may help answer clinically relevant questions to facilitate the development of novel therapies in DMD."

    "abstract": "Neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that can result in weakness of skeletal muscles. Examples include fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and conditions associated with high morbidity such as myopathies (muscle diseases). Many of these disorders are known to have abnormal protein folding and protein aggregates. Thus, easy to apply methods for the detection of such changes may prove useful diagnostic biomarkers. Raman spectroscopy has shown early promise in the detection of muscle pathology in neuromuscular disorders and is well suited to characterising the conformational profiles relating to protein secondary structure. In this work, we assess if Raman spectroscopy can detect differences in protein structure in muscle in the setting of neuromuscular disease. We utilise <i>in vivo</i> Raman spectroscopy measurements from preclinical models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the myopathy Duchenne muscular dystrophy, together with <i>ex vivo</i> measurements of human muscle samples from individuals with and without myopathy. Using quantitative conformation profiling and matrix factorisation we demonstrate that quantitative 'conformational fingerprinting' can be used to identify changes in protein folding in muscle. Notably, myopathic conditions in both preclinical models and human samples manifested a significant reduction in α-helix structures, with concomitant increases in β-sheet and, to a lesser extent, nonregular configurations. Spectral patterns derived through non-negative matrix factorisation were able to identify myopathy with a high accuracy (79% in mouse, 78% in human tissue). This work demonstrates the potential of conformational fingerprinting as an interpretable biomarker for neuromuscular disorders."

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle wasting results from numerous pathological conditions affecting both the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. A unifying feature of these pathologies is the upregulation of members of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, resulting in increased proteolytic degradation of target proteins. Despite the critical role of E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating muscle mass, the specific proteins they target for degradation and the mechanisms by which they regulate skeletal muscle homeostasis remain ill-defined. Here, using zebrafish loss-of-function models combined with in vivo cell biology and proteomic approaches, we reveal a role of atrogin-1 in regulating the levels of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP. Loss of atrogin-1 resulted in an accumulation of BiP, leading to impaired mitochondrial dynamics and a subsequent loss in muscle fiber integrity. We further implicated a disruption in atrogin-1-mediated BiP regulation in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We revealed that BiP was not only upregulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but its inhibition using pharmacological strategies, or by upregulating atrogin-1, significantly ameliorated pathology in a zebrafish model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Collectively, our data implicate atrogin-1 and BiP in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and highlight atrogin-1's essential role in maintaining muscle homeostasis."

    "abstract": "Scientific conferences increasingly suffer from the need for short presentations in which speakers like to dwell on the details of their work. A mitigating factor is to encourage discussion and planning of collaborations by organizing small meetings in a hotel large enough to host all attendees. This extends discussions' opportunities during morning breakfasts, lunches, dinners and long evenings together. Even if the vast majority of participants will not stay for the entire duration of the Conference, the possibilities for specialists to interact with specialists who are even very distant in terms of knowledge increase enormously. In any case, the results in terms of new job opportunities for young participants outweigh the costs for the organizers. Thirty years of Padova Muscle Days offer many examples, but the authors of this report on the state of the art of Mobility Medicine testify that this also happened in the 2024 Five Days of Muscle and Mobility Medicine (2024Pdm3) hosted at the Hotel Petrarca, Thermae of Euganea Hills and Padua, Italy which is in fact a valid countermeasure to the inevitable tendencies towards hyperspecialization that the explosive increase in scientific progress brings with it."

    "abstract": "Brain oscillations of non-rapid eye movement sleep, including slow oscillations (SO, 0.5-1.5 Hz) and spindles (10-16 Hz), mirror underlying brain maturation across development and are associated with cognition. Hence, age-associated emergence and changes in the electrophysiological properties of these rhythms can lend insight into cortical development, specifically in comparisons between pediatric populations and typically developing peers. We previously evaluated age-associated changes in SOs in male patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), finding a significant age-related decline between 4 and 18 years. While primarily a muscle disorder, male patients with DMD can also have sleep, cognitive, and cortical abnormalities, thought to be driven by altered dystrophin expression in the brain. In this follow-up study, we characterized the age-associated changes in sleep spindles. We found that age-dependent spindle characteristics in patients with DMD, including density, frequency, amplitude, and duration, were consistent with age-associated trends reported in the literature for typically developing controls. Combined with our prior finding of age-associated decline in SOs, our results suggest that SOs, but not spindles, are a candidate intervention target to enhance sleep in patients with DMD."

Ion channels play a pivotal role in muscle differentiation and interact with the dystrophin complex. To investigate ion channel involvement in myogenesis in dystrophic settings, we performed electrophysiological characterization of two immortalized mouse cell lines, wild-type (WT) H2K-2B4 and the dystrophic (DYS) H2K-SF1, and measured gene expression of differentiation markers and ion channels. Inward and outward currents/density increased as differentiation progressed in both WT and DYS cells. However, day-11 DYS cells showed higher (27%) inward current density with an increased expression ratio of Scn5a/Scn4a and decreased (48%) barium-sensitive outward current compared to WT. Furthermore, day-11 DYS cells showed more positive resting membrane potential (+10 mV) and lower membrane capacitance (50%) compared to WT. DYS cells also had reduced Myog and Myf5 expression at days 6 and 11. Overall, ion channel profile and myogenesis appeared altered in DYS cells. These results are a first step in validating ion channels as potential drug targets to ameliorate muscle degeneration in DMD settings and as differentiation biomarkers in innovative platforms."

Despite that, few studies have attempted to characterize changes in the muscles of these carriers using imaging tools, particularly muscle ultrasound (MUS). The aim of this study was to compare lower limb MUS findings in carriers of DMD pathogenic variants (cDMD) vs healthy controls. Twenty-eight women (15 cDMD and 13 controls) underwent clinical evaluation and MUS. We collected information about muscle-related symptoms and assessed muscle strength. MUS was performed by a single physician (blind to the genetic status of subjects). The following muscles were assessed: rectus femoris, sartorius, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius. For each site, we computed data on muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, sound attenuation index, and elastography. Between-group comparisons were assessed using nonparametric tests and p-values <.05 were deemed significant. None of the subjects had objective muscle weakness, but exercise intolerance/fatigue was reported by four cDMDs and only one control. Regarding MUS, sound attenuation indices were significantly higher among carriers for all muscles tested. Longitudinal and axial deep echo intensities for the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior were also higher in the cDMD group compared with controls. No significant between-group differences were noted for elastography values, muscle area, or mean echo intensities. cDMD have skeletal muscle abnormalities that can be detected using quantitative MUS. Further studies are needed to determine whether such abnormalities are related to muscle symptoms in these patients."

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload can mediate mitochondria-dependent cell death, a major contributor to several human diseases. Indeed, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (MD) is driven by dysfunctional Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx across the sarcolemma that causes mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, organelle rupture, and muscle necrosis. The mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) complex is the primary characterized mechanism for acute mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. One strategy for preventing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is deletion of the Mcu gene, the pore forming subunit of the MCU-complex. Conversely, enhanced MCU-complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is achieved by deleting the inhibitory Mcub gene. Here we show that myofiber-specific Mcu deletion was not protective in a mouse model of Duchenne MD. Specifically, Mcu gene deletion did not reduce muscle histopathology, did not improve muscle function, and did not prevent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. Moreover, myofiber specific Mcub gene deletion did not augment Duchenne MD muscle pathology. Interestingly, we observed MCU-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in dystrophic mitochondria that was sufficient to drive mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) activation and skeletal muscle necrosis, and this same type of activity was observed in heart, liver, and brain mitochondria. These results demonstrate that mitochondria possess an uncharacterized MCU-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake mechanism that is sufficient to drive MPTP-dependent necrosis in MD in vivo."

    "abstract": "Deposition of the exon junction complex (EJC) upstream of exon-exon junctions helps maintain transcriptome integrity by preventing spurious re-splicing events in already spliced mRNAs. Here we investigate the importance of EJC for the correct splicing of the 2.2-megabase-long human DMD pre-mRNA, which encodes dystrophin, an essential protein involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. Using targeted RNA-seq, we show that knock-down of the eIF4A3 and Y14 core components of EJC in a human muscle cell line causes an accumulation of mis-splicing events clustered towards the 3' end of the DMD transcript (Dp427m). This deregulation is conserved in the short Dp71 isoform expressed ubiquitously except in adult skeletal muscle and is rescued with wild-type eIF4A3 and Y14 proteins but not with an EJC assembly-defective mutant eIF4A3. MLN51 protein and EJC-associated ASAP/PSAP complexes independently modulate the inclusion of the regulated exons 71 and 78. Our data confirm the protective role of EJC in maintaining splicing fidelity, which in the DMD gene is necessary to preserve the function of the critical C-terminal protein-protein interaction domain of dystrophin present in all tissue-specific isoforms. Given the role of the EJC in maintaining the integrity of dystrophin, we asked whether the EJC could also be involved in the regulation of a mechanism as complex as skeletal muscle differentiation. We found that eIF4A3 knockdown impairs myogenic differentiation by blocking myotube formation. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the functional roles of EJC in human skeletal muscle."

The need for longitudinal data regarding DMD that could serve as a control for determining treatment efficacy in clinical trials has increased notably. The present study examined the longitudinal data of Japanese DMD patients collectively and assessed individual patients with pathogenic variants eligible for exon-skipping therapy. Patients with DMD who visited Kobe University Hospital between March 1991 and March 2019 were enrolled. Data between the patients' first visit until age 20 years were examined. Three hundred thirty-seven patients were included. Serum creatine kinase levels showed extremely high values until the age of 6 years and a rapid decline from ages 7-12 years. Both the median 10-m run/walk velocity and rise-from-floor velocity peaked at the age of 4 years and declined with age. The values for respiratory function declined from the age of 11 years. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was >60% until the age of 12 years and rapidly declined from ages 13-15 years. Examination of the relationship between pathogenic variants eligible for exon-skipping therapy and longitudinal data revealed no characteristic findings. We found that creatine kinase levels and motor, respiratory, and cardiac functions each exhibited various changes over time. These findings provide useful information about the longitudinal data of several outcome measures for patients with DMD not receiving corticosteroids. These data may serve as historical controls in comparing the natural history of DMD patients not on regular steroid use in appropriate clinical trials."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy. Current diagnostic tests like genetic testing, needle electromyography, and muscle biopsy are either not easily available or invasive, and they are impractical for assessing disease progression and treatment outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a non-invasive and accurate investigative modality for DMD. In recent years, musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-MSK) along with fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have become major non-invasive tools. T1-weighted MRI-MSK and FA measures of DTI of 78 DMD patients were retrospectively studied to identify the distinct pattern of muscle involvement and fatty infiltration as age and/or disease progresses. Correlation analysis was performed between MRI-MSK grade score vs. age, muscle strength, and Vignos scale. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used. As age increased, the MRI grade score and Vignos score increased. There was a statistically significant high positive correlation between MRI-MSK grade score and age, and low positive correlation with Vignos scores. With increasing age, the muscle strength on manual muscle testing (MMT) and FA value decreased. There was high negative correlation with muscle strength on MMT and low positive correlation between FA values and MMT score. On T1-weighted MRI, a distinct pattern, extent, and distribution of lower limb muscle involvement can be seen. MRI-MSK grade score worsens with progressing age, reducing strength, and increasing functional impairment. FA alone may not be an accurate marker in assessing progression of DMD. MRI-MSK and other DTI measures should be further explored as diagnostic and prognostic tools for DMD."

Eligible articles were available in English and reported neurocognitive outcomes. Neurocognitive domains reported in a comparable way across a minimum of three studies were included. The neurocognitive domains of Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ) and Working memory (WMI) derived from Wechsler scales and receptive vocabulary ability derived from the Peabody Picture Verbal Test (PPVT) were included. A single mean meta-analysis was completed. <b>Results:</b> Relevant data was extracted and presented for 38 eligible studies; 2 of which are from grey literature. Results suggest children with DMD perform around 1SD below non-clinical norms for FSIQ, PIQ, VIQ and WMI. Unlike VIQ, scores derived from the PPVT were within the non-clinical norms. Studies were of moderate - high quality, there was significant heterogeneity and no publication bias. <b>Conclusion:</b> A systematic review of working memory has not previously been completed, it appears that children with DMD perform around 1SD below the mean, like FSIQ, PIQVIQ and WMI. The PPVT is a measure of receptive verbal ability and caution is recommended around the interchangeability of PPVT scores and the wider construct of verbal intelligence."

Preclinical and phase 2 study data have suggested that givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, might help to counteract the effects of this deficiency. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of givinostat in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 41 tertiary care sites in 11 countries. Eligible participants were ambulant, male, and aged at least 6 years, had a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, completed two four-stair climb assessments with a mean of 8 s or less (≤1 s variance), had a time-to-rise of at least 3 s but less than 10 s, and had received systemic corticosteroids for at least 6 months. Participating boys were randomly assigned (2:1, allocated according to a list generated by the interactive response technology provider) to receive either oral givinostat or matching placebo twice a day for 72 weeks, stratified by concomitant steroid use. Boys, investigators, and site and sponsor staff were masked to treatment assignment. The dose was flexible, based on weight, and was reduced if not tolerated. Boys were divided into two groups on the basis of their baseline vastus lateralis fat fraction (VLFF; measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy): group A comprised boys with a VLFF of more than 5% but no more than 30%, whereas group B comprised boys with a VLFF of 5% or less, or more than 30%. The primary endpoint compared the effects of givinostat and placebo on the change in results of the four-stair climb assessment between baseline and 72 weeks, in the intention-to-treat, group A population. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned boys who received at least one dose of study drug. When the first 50 boys in group A completed 12 months of treatment, an interim futility assessment was conducted, after which the sample size was adapted using masked data from the four-stair climb assessments. Furthermore, the starting dose of givinostat was reduced following a protocol amendment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02851797, and is complete. Between June 6, 2017, and Feb 22, 2022, 359 boys were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 179 were enrolled into the study (median age 9·8 years [IQR 8·1-11·0]), all of whom were randomly assigned (118 to receive givinostat and 61 to receive placebo); 170 (95%) boys completed the study. Of the 179 boys enrolled, 120 (67%) were in group A (81 givinostat and 39 placebo); of these, 114 (95%) completed the study. For participants in group A, comparing the results of the four-stair climb assessment at 72 weeks and baseline, the geometric least squares mean ratio was 1·27 (95% CI 1·17-1·37) for boys receiving givinostat and 1·48 (1·32-1·66) for those receiving placebo (ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·745-0·989; p=0·035). The most common adverse events in the givinostat group were diarrhoea (43 [36%] of 118 boys vs 11 [18%] of 61 receiving placebo) and vomiting (34 [29%] vs 8 [13%]); no treatment-related deaths occurred. Among ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, results of the four-stair climb assessment worsened in both groups over the study period; however, the decline was significantly smaller with givinostat than with placebo. The dose of givinostat was reduced after an interim safety analysis, but no new safety signals were reported. An ongoing extension study is evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of givinostat in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Italfarmaco."

    "title": "Apelin stimulation of the vascular skeletal muscle stem cell niche enhances endogenous repair in dystrophic mice.",
    "abstract": "Impaired skeletal muscle stem cell (MuSC) function has long been suspected to contribute to the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy (MD). Here, we showed that defects in the endothelial cell (EC) compartment of the vascular stem cell niche in mouse models of Duchenne MD, laminin α2-related MD, and collagen VI-related myopathy were associated with inefficient mobilization of MuSCs after tissue damage. Using chemoinformatic analysis, we identified the 13-amino acid form of the peptide hormone apelin (AP-13) as a candidate for systemic stimulation of skeletal muscle ECs. Systemic administration of AP-13 using osmotic pumps generated a pro-proliferative EC-rich niche that supported MuSC function through angiocrine factors and markedly improved tissue regeneration and muscle strength in all three dystrophic mouse models. Moreover, EC-specific knockout of the apelin receptor led to regenerative defects that phenocopied key pathological features of MD, including vascular defects, fibrosis, muscle fiber necrosis, impaired MuSC function, and reduced force generation. Together, these studies provide in vivo proof of concept that enhancing endogenous skeletal muscle repair by targeting the vascular niche is a viable therapeutic avenue for MD and characterized AP-13 as a candidate for further study for the systemic treatment of MuSC dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy shows promise as a biomarker for complex nerve and muscle (neuromuscular) diseases. To maximise its potential, several challenges remain. These include the sensitivity to different instrument configurations, translation across preclinical/human tissues and the development of multivariate analytics that can derive interpretable spectral outputs for disease identification. Nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) can extract features from high-dimensional data sets and the nonnegative constraint results in physically realistic outputs. In this study, we have undertaken NMF on Raman spectra of muscle obtained from different clinical and preclinical settings. First, we obtained and combined Raman spectra from human patients with mitochondrial disease and healthy volunteers, using both a commercial microscope and in-house fibre optic probe. NMF was applied across all data, and spectral patterns common to both equipment configurations were identified. Linear discriminant models utilising these patterns were able to accurately classify disease states (accuracy 70.2-84.5%). Next, we applied NMF to spectra obtained from the <i>mdx</i> mouse model of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy and patients with dystrophic muscle conditions. Spectral fingerprints common to mouse/human were obtained and able to accurately identify disease (accuracy 79.5-98.8%). We conclude that NMF can be used to analyse Raman data across different equipment configurations and the preclinical/clinical divide. Thus, the application of NMF decomposition methods could enhance the potential of Raman spectroscopy for the study of fatal neuromuscular diseases."

    "title": "Lessons for future clinical trials in adults with Becker muscular dystrophy: Disease progression detected by muscle magnetic resonance imaging, clinical and patient-reported outcome measures.",
    "abstract": "Because Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a heterogeneous disease and only few studies have evaluated adult patients, it is currently still unclear which outcome measures should be used in future clinical trials. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging, patient-reported outcome measures and a wide range of clinical outcome measures, including motor function, muscle strength and timed-function tests, were evaluated in 21 adults with BMD at baseline and at 9 and 18 months of follow-up. Proton density fat fraction increased significantly in 10/17 thigh muscles after 9 months, and in all thigh and lower leg muscles after 18 months. The 32-item Motor Function Measurement (MFM-32) scale (-1.3%, p = 0.017), North Star Ambulatory Assessment (-1.3 points, p = 0.010) and patient-reported activity limitations scale (-0.3 logits, p = 0.018) deteriorated significantly after 9 months. The 6-min walk distance (-28.7 m, p = 0.042), 10-m walking test (-0.1 m/s, p = 0.032), time to climb four stairs test (-0.03 m/s, p = 0.028) and Biodex peak torque measurements of quadriceps (-4.6 N m, p = 0.014) and hamstrings (-5.0 N m, p = 0.019) additionally deteriorated significantly after 18 months. At this timepoint, domain 1 of the MFM-32 was the only clinical outcome measure with a large sensitivity to change (standardized response mean 1.15). It is concluded that proton density fat fraction imaging of entire thigh muscles is a sensitive outcome measure to track progressive muscle fat replacement in patients with BMD, already after 9 months of follow-up. Finally, significant changes are reported in a wide range of clinical and patient-reported outcome measures, of which the MFM-32 appeared to be the most sensitive to change in adults with BMD."

    "abstract": "Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a multifaceted, X-linked, neurodegenerative disorder that comprises several clinical phenotypes. ALD affects patients through a variety of physical, emotional, social, and other disease-specific factors that collectively contribute to disease burden. To facilitate clinical care and research, it is important to identify which symptoms are most common and relevant to individuals with any subtype of ALD. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and an international cross-sectional study to determine the most prevalent and important symptoms of ALD. Our study included adult participants with a diagnosis of ALD who were recruited from national and international patient registries. Responses were categorized by age, sex, disease phenotype, functional status, and other demographic and clinical features. Seventeen individuals with ALD participated in qualitative interviews, providing 1709 direct quotes regarding their symptomatic burden. One hundred and nine individuals participated in the cross-sectional survey study, which inquired about 182 unique symptoms representing 24 distinct symptomatic themes. The symptomatic themes with the highest prevalence in the overall ALD sample cohort were problems with balance (90.9%), limitations with mobility or walking (87.3%), fatigue (86.4%), and leg weakness (86.4%). The symptomatic themes with the highest impact scores (on a 0-4 scale with 4 being the most severe) were trouble getting around (2.35), leg weakness (2.25), and problems with balance (2.21). A higher prevalence of symptomatic themes was associated with functional disability, employment disruption, and speech impairment. There are many patient-relevant symptoms and themes that contribute to disease burden in individuals with ALD. These symptoms, identified by those having ALD, present key targets for further research and therapeutic development."

    "title": "Comprehensive analysis of genomic complexity in the 5' end coding region of the DMD gene in patients of exons 1-2 duplications based on long-read sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Dystrophinopathies are the most common X-linked inherited muscle diseases, and the disease-causing gene is DMD. Exonic duplications are a common type of pathogenic variants in the DMD gene, however, 5' end exonic duplications containing exon 1 are less common. When assessing the pathogenicity of exonic duplications in the DMD gene, consideration must be given to their impact on the reading frame. Traditional molecular methods, such as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), are commonly used in clinics. However, they cannot discriminate the precise physical locations of breakpoints and structural features of genomic rearrangement. Long-read sequencing (LRS) can effectively overcome this limitation. We used LRS technology to perform whole genome sequencing on three families and analyze the structural variations of the DMD gene, which involves the duplications of exon 1 and/or exon 2. Two distinct variant types encompassing exon 1 in the DMD Dp427m isoform and/or Dp427c isoform are identified, which have been infrequently reported previously. In pedigree 1, the male individuals harboring duplication variant of consecutive exons 1-2 in the DMD canonical transcript (Dp427m) and exon 1 in the Dp427c transcript are normal, indicating the variant is likely benign. In pedigree 3, the patient carries complex SVs involving exon 1 of the DMD Dp427c transcript showing an obvious phenotype. The locations of the breakpoints and the characteristics of structural variants (SVs) are identified by LRS, enabling the classification of the variants' pathogenicity. Our research sheds light on the complexity of DMD variants encompassing Dp427c/Dp427m promoter regions and emphasizes the importance of cautious interpretation when assessing the pathogenicity of DMD 5' end exonic duplications, particularly in carrier screening scenarios without an affected proband."

As a proof of principle, we applied EVs from the serum of patients with muscular dystrophy to Caenorhabditis elegans and demonstrated their capability to induce a spectrum of muscle pathologies, including lifespan shortening and robust impairment of muscle organization and function. This demonstrates that patient-derived EVs can deliver disease-relevant pathologies between species and can be exploited for establishing novel and personalized models of human disease. Such models can potentially be used for disease diagnosis, prognosis, analyzing treatment responses, drug screening and identification of the disease-transmitting cargo of patient-derived EVs and their cellular targets. This system complements traditional genetic disease models and enables modeling of multifactorial diseases and of those not yet associated with specific genetic mutations."

    "abstract": "Considering the difficulties and challenges in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treatment, such as the adverse effects of glucocorticoids, which are the main medical prescription used by dystrophic patients, new treatment concepts for dystrophic therapy are very necessary. Thus, in this study, we explore the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM; a non-invasive therapy) and Idebenone (IDE) treatment (a potent antioxidant), applied alone or in association, in dystrophic muscle cells and the quadriceps muscle, with special focus on autophagy and regenerative pathways. For the in vitro studies, the dystrophic primary muscle cells received 0.5J LEDT and 0.06μM IDE; and for the in vivo studies, the dystrophic quadriceps muscle received 3J LEDT and the mdx mice were treated with 200mg/kg IDE. LEDT and IDE treatment modulate autophagy by increasing autophagy markers (SQSTM1/p62, Beclin and Parkin) and signaling pathways (AMPK and TGF-β). Concomitantly, the treatments prevented muscle degeneration by reducing the number of IgG-positive fibers and the fibers with a central nucleus; decreasing the fibrotic area; up-regulating the myogenin and MCH-slow levels; and down-regulating the MyoD and MHC-fast levels. These results suggest that LEDT and IDE treatments enhance autophagy and prevented muscle degeneration in the dystrophic muscle of the experimental model. These findings illustrate the potential efficacy of LEDT and IDE treatment as an alternative therapy focused on muscle recovery in the dystrophic patient."

We examined various ECG parameters in children with DMD, in comparison with age-matched controls. Standard 12-lead ECG tracings of serial patients were screened for quality and selected. Controls were healthy, age-matched school-going children. Both quantitative and qualitative ECG parameters were analyzed. After screening, ECGs from 252 patients with DMD (8.32 ± 3.12 years, 2-21 years) and ECGs from 151 age-matched healthy controls (9.72 ± 2.23, 4-19 years) were included. A significantly higher heart rate, shorter R-R interval, and taller R wave in V1 were seen across all age group of DMD in comparison to controls, with the difference increasing with age. While QT prolongation was seen in all age groups of DMD, QTc prolongation was seen only at 10 years or more. Incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and pathological Q waves in inferolateral leads were exclusive in DMD, with the latter declining with age. Evidence for left ventricular (LV) pathology, such as tall R in V5/V6, increase in SV1 + RV6 height, and QRS complex duration, were seen only in the age group of 10 years or more. Stratification based on age and comparison with age-matched healthy subjects showed that several ECG parameters were influenced by age, and it also identified age-dependent evidence for LV pathology and QTc prolongation in DMD."

    "abstract": "Pathogenic missense variants in the dystrophin (DMD) gene are rarely reported in dystrophinopathies. Most DMD missense variants are of uncertain significance and their pathogenicity interpretation remains complicated. We aimed to investigate whether DMD missense variants would cause aberrant splicing and re-interpret their pathogenicity based on mRNA and protein studies. Nine unrelated patients who had an elevated serum creatine kinase level with or without muscle weakness were enrolled. They underwent a detailed clinical, imaging, and pathological assessment. Routine genetic testing and muscle-derived mRNA and protein studies of dystrophin and sarcoglycan genes were performed in them. Three of the 9 patients presented with a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) phenotype and the remaining 6 patients had a suspected diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) or sarcoglycanopathy based on their clinical and pathological characteristics. Routine genetic testing detected only 9 predicted DMD missense variants in them, of which 6 were novel and interpreted as uncertain significance. Muscle-derived mRNA studies of sarcoglycan genes didn't reveal any aberrant transcripts in them. Dystrophin mRNA studies confirmed that 3 predicted DMD missense variants (c.2380G > C, c.4977C > G, and c.5444A > G) were in fact splicing and frameshift variants due to aberrant splicing. The 9 DMD variants were re-interpreted as pathogenic or likely pathogenic based on mRNA and protein studies. Therefore, 3 patients with DMD splicing variants and 6 patients with confirmed DMD missense variants were diagnosed with DMD and BMD, respectively. Our study highlights the importance of muscle biopsy and aberrant splicing for clinical and genetic interpretation of uncertain DMD missense variants."

    "abstract": "Dystrophin loss due to mutations in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene is associated with a wide spectrum of neurocognitive comorbidities, including an aberrant unconditioned fear response to stressful/threat stimuli. Dystrophin-deficient animal models of DMD demonstrate enhanced stress reactivity that manifests as sustained periods of immobility. When the threat is repetitive or severe in nature, dystrophinopathy phenotypes can be exacerbated and even cause sudden death. Thus, it is apparent that enhanced sensitivity to stressful/threat stimuli in dystrophin-deficient vertebrates is a legitimate cause of concern for patients with DMD that could impact neurocognition and pathophysiology. This review discusses our current understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of the hypersensitive fear response in preclinical models of DMD and the potential challenges facing clinical translatability."

US patients with DMD receiving eteplirsen were followed through a patient support program, with data collected on ages at eteplirsen initiation and death/end of follow-up. Individual DMD NH data were extracted by digitizing Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves from published systematic and targeted literature reviews. Overall survival age was analyzed using KM curves and contextualized with DMD NH survival curves; subanalyses considered age groups and duration of eteplirsen exposure. Overall survival time from treatment initiation was also evaluated. A total of 579 eteplirsen-treated patients were included. During a total follow-up of 2119 person-years, median survival age was 32.8 years. DMD NH survival curves extracted from four publications (follow-up for 1224 DMD NH controls) showed overall pooled median survival age of 27.4 years. Eteplirsen-treated patients had significantly longer survival from treatment initiation versus age-matched controls (age-adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.98; p < .05). Longer treatment exposure was associated with improved survival (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.41; p < .001). Comparisons using different DMD NH cohorts to address common risks of bias yielded consistent findings. Data suggest eteplirsen may prolong survival in patients with DMD across a wide age range. As more data become available, the impact of eteplirsen on survival will be further elucidated."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) occurs due to genetic mutations that lead to a deficiency in dystrophin production and consequent progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle fibres, through oxidative stress and an exacerbated inflammatory process. The flavonoid trilobatin (TLB) demonstrates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential. Its high safety profile and effective action make it a potent therapy for the process of dystrophic muscle myonecrosis. Thus, we sought to investigate the action of TLB on damage in a DMD model, the mdx mouse. Eight-week-old male animals were treated with 160 mg/kg/day of trilobatin for 8 weeks. Control animals were treated with saline. Following treatment, muscle strength, serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, histopathology (necrotic myofibres, regenerated fibres/central nuclei, Feret's diameter and inflammatory area) and the levels of catalase and NF-κB (western blotting) of the quadriceps (QUA), diaphragm (DIA) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were measured. TLB was able to significantly increase muscle strength and reduce serum CK levels in dystrophic animals. The QUA of mdx mice showed a reduction in catalase and the number of fibres with a centralized nucleus after treatment with TLB. In the DIA of dystrophic animals, TLB reduced the necrotic myofibres, inflammatory area and NF-κB and increased the number of regenerated fibres and the total fibre diameter. In TA, TLB increased the number of regenerated fibres and reduced catalase levels in these animals. It is concluded that in the mdx experimental model, treatment with TLB was beneficial in the treatment of DMD."

To investigate the molecular basis of DCM in a 37-year-old woman. Clinical and genetic investigations were performed. Genetic testing was performed with whole exome sequencing (WES) using the Illumina platform. According to the standard protocol, a variant found by WES was confirmed in all available members of the family by bi-directional capillary Sanger resequencing. The effect of the variant was investigated by using an in silico prediction of pathogenicity. The index case was a 37-year-old woman diagnosed with DCM at the age of 33. A germline heterozygous A>G transversion at nucleotide 10103 in the <i>DMD</i> gene, leading to an aspartic acid-glycine substitution at the amino acid 3368 of the DMD protein (c.10103A>G p.Asp3368Gly), was identified and confirmed by PCR-based Sanger sequencing of the exon 70. In silico prediction suggests that this variant could have a deleterious impact on protein structure and functionality (CADD = 30). The genetic analysis was extended to the first-degree relatives of the proband (mother, father, and sister) and because of the absence of the variant in both parents, the p.Asp3368Gly substitution was considered as occurring de novo. Then, the direct sequencing analysis of her 8-year-old son identified as hemizygous for the same variant. The young patient did not present any signs or symptoms attributable to DCM, but reported asthenia and presented with bilateral calf hypertrophy at clinical examination. Laboratory testing revealed increased levels of creatinine kinase (maximum value of 19,000 IU/L). We report an early presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy in a 33-year-old woman due to a de novo pathogenic variant of the dystrophin (<i>DMD</i>) gene (p.Asp3368Gly). Genetic identification of this variant allowed an early diagnosis of a skeletal muscle disease in her son."

    "abstract": "The diaphragm muscle is essential for breathing, and its dysfunctions can be fatal. Many disorders affect the diaphragm, including muscular dystrophies. Despite the clinical relevance of targeting the diaphragm, there have been few studies evaluating diaphragm function following a given experimental treatment, with most of these involving anti-inflammatory drugs or gene therapy. Cell-based therapeutic approaches have shown success promoting muscle regeneration in several mouse models of muscular dystrophy, but these have focused mainly on limb muscles. Here we show that transplantation of as few as 5000 satellite cells directly into the diaphragm results in consistent and robust myofiber engraftment in dystrophin- and fukutin-related protein-mutant dystrophic mice. Transplanted cells also seed the stem cell reservoir, as shown by the presence of donor-derived satellite cells. Force measurements showed enhanced diaphragm strength in engrafted muscles. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of cell transplantation to target the diseased diaphragm and improve its contractility."

    "abstract": "Since its discovery in 2012, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has supposed a promising panorama for developing novel and highly precise genome editing-based gene therapy (GT) alternatives, leading to overcoming the challenges associated with classical GT. Classical GT aims to deliver transgenes to the cells via their random integration in the genome or episomal persistence into the nucleus through lentivirus (LV) or adeno-associated virus (AAV), respectively. Although high transgene expression efficiency is achieved by using either LV or AAV, their nature can result in severe side effects in humans. For instance, an LV (NCT03852498)- and AAV9 (NCT05514249)-based GT clinical trials for treating X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy showed the development of myelodysplastic syndrome and patient's death, respectively. In contrast with classical GT, the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing requires the homologous direct repair (HDR) machinery of the cells for inserting the transgene in specific regions of the genome. This sophisticated and well-regulated process is limited in the cell cycle of mammalian cells, and in turn, the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) predominates. Consequently, seeking approaches to increase HDR efficiency over NHEJ is crucial. This manuscript comprehensively reviews the current alternatives for improving the HDR for CRISPR/Cas9-based GTs."

After PGT-M, unaffected (i.e., normal) embryos after genetic detection were transferred into the uterus of their corresponding mothers. A total of 43 carrier couples with the following hereditary neurological diseases or metabolic diseases dominated by nervous system phenotypes underwent PGT-M: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (13 families); methylmalonic acidemia (7 families); spinal muscular atrophy (5 families); infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and intellectual developmental disorder (3 families each); Cockayne syndrome (2 families); Menkes disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, glycine encephalopathy with epilepsy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, mucopolysaccharidosis, Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, adrenoleukodystrophy, phenylketonuria, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Dravet syndrome (1 family each). After 53 PGT-M cycles, the final transferable embryo rate was 12.45%, the clinical pregnancy rate was 74.19%, and the live birth rate was 89.47%; a total of 18 unaffected (i.e., healthy) children were born to these families.

    "abstract": "Metformin (N,N-dimethylbiguanide), an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis and insulin sensitizer, is widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In some patients with renal insufficiency, metformin can accumulate and cause lactic acidosis, known as metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA, defined as lactate ≥ 5 mM, pH < 7.35, and metformin concentration > 38.7 µM). Here, we report on the post-translational modification (PTM) of proline (Pro) to 4-hydroxyproline (OH-Pro) in metformin-associated lactic acidosis and in metformin-treated patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Pro and OH-Pro were measured simultaneously by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry before, during, and after renal replacement therapy in a patient admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of MALA. At admission to the ICU, plasma metformin concentration was 175 µM, with a corresponding lactate concentration of 20 mM and a blood pH of 7.1. Throughout ICU admission, the Pro concentration was lower compared to healthy controls. Renal excretion of OH-Pro was initially high and decreased over time. Moreover, during the first 12 h of ICU admission, OH-Pro seems to be renally secreted while thereafter, it was reabsorbed. Our results suggest that MALA is associated with hyper-hydroxyprolinuria due to elevated PTM of Pro to OH-Pro by prolyl-hydroxylase and/or inhibition of OH-Pro metabolism in the kidneys. In BMD patients, metformin, at the therapeutic dose of 3 × 500 mg per day for 6 weeks, increased the urinary excretion of OH-Pro suggesting elevation of Pro hydroxylation to OH-Pro. Our study suggests that metformin induces specifically the expression/activity of prolyl-hydroxylase in metformin intoxication and BMD."

We found that cyclosporin did not block the beneficial effect of 1-month OVL on plantaris muscle fragility in mdx mice, nor did it limit the increases in maximal force and muscle weight (an index of hypertrophy). Fragility and maximal force were also ameliorated by OVL in the plantaris muscle of D2-mdx mice. In addition, OVL increased the expression of utrophin, cytoplamic γ-actin, MyoD, and p-Akt in the D2-mdx mice, proteins playing an important role in fragility, maximal force gain and muscle growth. In conclusion, OVL reduced fragility and increased maximal force in the more frequently used mild mdx model but also in D2-mdx mice, a severe model of DMD, closer to human physiopathology. Moreover, these beneficial effects of OVL did not seem to be related to the activation of the calcineurin pathway. Thus, this preclinical study suggests that resistance training could have a potential benefit in the improvement of the quality of life of DMD patients."

    "abstract": "Clinical deployment of oligonucleotides requires delivery technologies that improve stability, target tissue accumulation and cellular internalization. Exosomes show potential as ideal delivery vehicles. However, an affordable generalizable system for efficient loading of oligonucleotides on exosomes remain lacking. Here, we identified an Exosomal Anchor DNA Aptamer (EAA) via SELEX against exosomes immobilized with our proprietary CP05 peptides. EAA shows high binding affinity to different exosomes and enables efficient loading of nucleic acid drugs on exosomes. Serum stability of thrombin inhibitor NU172 was prolonged by exosome-loading, resulting in increased blood flow after injury in vivo. Importantly, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy PMO can be readily loaded on exosomes via EAA (EXO<sub>EAA-PMO</sub>). EXO<sub>EAA-PMO</sub> elicited significantly greater muscle cell uptake, tissue accumulation and dystrophin expression than PMO in vitro and in vivo. Systemic administration of EXO<sub>EAA-PMO</sub> elicited therapeutic levels of dystrophin restoration and functional improvements in mdx mice. Altogether, our study demonstrates that EAA enables efficient loading of different nucleic acid drugs on exosomes, thus providing an easy and generalizable strategy for loading nucleic acid therapeutics on exosomes."

    "title": "Cell-mediated exon skipping normalizes dystrophin expression and muscle function in a new mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Cell therapy for muscular dystrophy has met with limited success, mainly due to the poor engraftment of donor cells, especially in fibrotic muscle at an advanced stage of the disease. We developed a cell-mediated exon skipping that exploits the multinucleated nature of myofibers to achieve cross-correction of resident, dystrophic nuclei by the U7 small nuclear RNA engineered to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. We observed that co-culture of genetically corrected human DMD myogenic cells (but not of WT cells) with their dystrophic counterparts at a ratio of either 1:10 or 1:30 leads to dystrophin production at a level several folds higher than what predicted by simple dilution. This is due to diffusion of U7 snRNA to neighbouring dystrophic resident nuclei. When transplanted into NSG-mdx-Δ51mice carrying a mutation of exon 51, genetically corrected human myogenic cells produce dystrophin at much higher level than WT cells, well in the therapeutic range, and lead to force recovery even with an engraftment of only 3-5%. This level of dystrophin production is an important step towards clinical efficacy for cell therapy."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the skeletal muscles. Renal dysfunction in patients with DMD has recently become more apparent as life expectancy has increased owing to advances in respiratory devices and heart failure therapies. A 23-year-old man with DMD who required nasal tube feeding was referred to our hospital with a 4-month history of renal dysfunction and anemia. The patient's serum creatinine (sCr) level was within the normal range (0.84 mg/dL), but his serum cystatin C level and estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by cystatin C (5.90 mg/L and 7.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively) indicated severe renal impairment. A urinalysis revealed elevated levels of protein and tubular markers. The patient's hemoglobin and erythropoietin levels indicated renal anemia. Hypotension, a collapsed inferior vena cava, and a poor tube feeding episode suggested that the kidney injury was due to renal ischemia, which progressed to tubulointerstitial kidney injury, an intrinsic kidney injury. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers were discontinued, and extracellular fluid was infused. Thereafter, the patient's renal function recovered. Subsequently, the patient's urinary findings and anemia improved. Although advances in cardioprotective agents are expected to improve the prognosis of patients with DMD, it is important to consider that the number of patients with kidney injury due to renal ischemia may increase and that it is difficult to evaluate renal function using sCr level in patients with DMD because of decreased skeletal muscle mass."

    "abstract": "In muscular dystrophies, muscle fibers loose integrity and die, causing significant suffering and premature death. Strikingly, the extraocular muscles (EOMs) are spared, functioning well despite the disease progression. Although EOMs have been shown to differ from body musculature, the mechanisms underlying this inherent resistance to muscle dystrophies remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate important differences in gene expression as a response to muscle dystrophies between the EOMs and trunk muscles in zebrafish via transcriptomic profiling. We show that the LIM-protein Fhl2 is increased in response to the knockout of desmin, plectin and obscurin, cytoskeletal proteins whose knockout causes different muscle dystrophies, and contributes to disease protection of the EOMs. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of fhl2b can partially rescue the muscle phenotype in the zebrafish Duchenne muscular dystrophy model sapje, significantly improving their survival. Therefore, Fhl2 is a protective agent and a candidate target gene for therapy of muscular dystrophies."

    "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder characterized by progressive and severe muscle weakening and degeneration. Among the various forms of muscular dystrophy, it stands out as one of the most common and impactful, predominantly affecting boys. The condition arises due to mutations in the dystrophin gene, a key player in maintaining the structure and function of muscle fibers. The manuscript explores the structural features of dystrophin protein and their pivotal roles in DMD. We present an in-depth analysis of promising therapeutic approaches targeting dystrophin and their implications for the therapeutic management of DMD. Several therapies aiming to restore dystrophin protein or address secondary pathology have obtained regulatory approval, and many others are ongoing clinical development. Notably, recent advancements in genetic approaches have demonstrated the potential to restore partially functional dystrophin forms. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of the status of clinical trials for major therapeutic genetic approaches for DMD. In addition, we have summarized the ongoing therapeutic approaches and advanced mechanisms of action for dystrophin restoration and the challenges associated with DMD therapeutics."

During daily activities, for gait and dynamic balance, certain postural modifications are required. The objective was to compare the impact of trunk-oriented exercises versus whole-body vibration on abdominal muscle thickness and balance in children with DMD. Participants in this study were 30 boys with DMD, aged 6 to 10 years old. Children were divided into two groups (A and B) randomly. Children in group (A) underwent a prescribed regimen of physical therapy along with trunk-oriented exercises, whereas group (B) received the same regimen as group (A) together with whole-body vibration three times per week for three consecutive months. Balance and the thickness of the abdominal muscles were measured using the Biodex balance system and ultrasonography, respectively, before and after therapy. When compared to the pre-treatment results in both groups, the post-treatment results showed a significant difference in all measured variables (p<0.05). Post-treatment values showed that all of the measured variables significantly differed in favor of group A. Trunk-oriented exercises can improve abdominal thickness and balance more effectively than whole-body vibration in children with DMD. gov ID: NCT05688072."

The purpose of this study is to examine the arrhythmia and ectopy burden in patients with DMD and non-DMD dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to characterize the cardiac histopathologic changes in DMD patients across the disease spectrum. This was a retrospective analysis of age-matched patients with DMD and non-DMD DCM who received a Holter monitor and cardiac imaging within 100 days of each other between 2010 and 2020. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitors were classified based on the most recent left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of monitoring. Cardiac histopathologic specimens from whole-heart examinations at the time of autopsy from three DMD patients and one DCM patient were reviewed. A total of 367 patients with 1299 Holter monitor recordings were included over the study period, with 94% representing DMD patients and 6% non-DMD DCM. Patients with DMD had more atrial ectopy across the cardiac function spectrum (p < 0.05). There was no difference in ventricular ectopy. Four DMD patients developed symptomatic atrial arrhythmias. Autopsy specimens from DMD patients demonstrated fibrofatty infiltration of both atrial and ventricular myocardium. The atrial myocardium in patients with DMD is unique. Autopsy specimens reveal fibofatty replacement of the atrial myocardium, which may be a nidus for both ectopy and arrhythmias in DMD patients."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are inherited X-linked disorders resulting from alterations in the dystrophin gene. Genotype-phenotype matching studies have revealed a link between disease severity, the amount of muscle dystrophin, and the extent of mutation/deletion on the dystrophin gene. This study aimed to assess the relationship between genetic alterations in the dystrophin gene and the clinical status of patients with dystrophinopathies among the Iranian population. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study examined 54 patients with muscle weakness caused by abnormalities in the dystrophin gene at a hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, in 2021. The participants' demographic information, including age, family history of muscle dystrophies, and family history of other medical diseases as well as the type of muscular dystrophy were recorded. Furthermore, the number and region of deleted exons based on dystrophy types were also evaluated using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The patients' gaits were also assessed as using a wheelchair, the presence of waddling gaits, or toe gaits. The patients' clinical status and the coexistence of pulmonary, bulbar, and mental conditions were also examined and compared between the two groups of dystrophinopathies. <b>Results:</b> In this study, 54 patients with dystrophinopathy with the mean age of 16.63 ± 12.10 years were evaluated, of whom 22 (40.7%) and 30 (55.6%) patients were classified as BMD and DMD, respectively. The most affected regions with deleted exons were exons 45-47 (n = 5) and 45-48 (n = 4) in patients with BMD, while exons 45, 48-52, 51-55, and 53 (2 cases per exon) were the most common affected exons in patients with DMD. Further analyses revealed that deletions in exons 45-47 and 51-55 were significantly associated with older and younger ages at the onset of becoming wheelchair-bound in patients with dystrophy, respectively. The hotspot range in both BMD and DMD was within exons 45-55 (n = 15 for each group); 63% of the patients had alterations on the dystrophin gene within this range [30 patients (68.18%) in the BMD group, 15 patients (53.57%) in the DMD group]. <b>Conclusion:</b> Exon deletion was the most common genetic alteration in patients with dystrophinopathies. No significant difference was observed between DMD and BMD regarding the number of deleted exons. Deletions in exons 45-47 and 51-55 were linked to later and earlier onset of becoming wheelchair-bound, respectively."

This study explored participants' experiences with a one-year training program. Five semi-structured qualitative individual interviews and one focus group interview were conducted and analyzed using systematic text condensation. Participants included boys with DMD who participated in the intervention study (<i>n</i> = 10), their relatives and/or assistants (<i>n</i> = 7). Four main themes emerged: 1) the crucial role of motivation to maintain training routines, 2) benefiting from exercise, but with a need for balancing it, 3) time management challenges, and 4) the training as a social arena and meeting place. The participants emphasized the importance of experiencing progress, basic skills and enjoyable training. Parents were reassured knowing the appropriate exercise intensity and technique. The boys needed flexibility and support to find a balance between exercise and other activities and described benefits from sharing experiences with each other. Clinical guidelines for physical exercise in DMD should encompass customization of exercise interventions supporting motivational factors, balance and social interaction, and identify competing commitments. Successful training programs may enhance quality of life and functionality for these boys."

A 9-year-old castrated male domestic shorthair cat was presented with persistent muscle swelling and breathing difficulty from 3 years of age.

Physical and neurological examinations showed muscle swelling in the neck and proximal limb, slow gait, and occasional breathing difficulties. Electromyography showed pseudomyotonic discharges and complex repetitive discharges with a \"dive-bomber\" sound. Histopathology revealed muscle necrosis and regeneration. Whole-genome sequencing identified a novel and unique hemizygous nonsense genetic variant, c.8333G > A in dystrophin (DMD), potentially causing a premature termination codon (p.Trp2778Ter).

In this review, we describe the molecular, preclinical, and clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of HDACis in countering disease progression by targeting pathogenic networks of gene expression in multiple muscle-resident cell types of patients with DMD. Given that givinostat is paving the way for HDACi-based interventions in DMD, next-generation HDACis with optimized therapeutic profiles and efficacy could be also explored for synergistic combinations with other therapeutic strategies."

There are currently no effective therapeutics available. Having demonstrated the efficacy of a N-163 strain of Aureobasidium Pullulans (Neu-REFIX) produced B-1, 3-1,6-Glucan in pre-clinical and clinical studies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) earlier, we assessed the effectiveness of this novel Beta glucan in the other muscular dystrophies in the present study. In this 60-day study, six patients with muscular dystrophies other than DMD consumed one 8g gel of Neu-REFIX beta-glucan along with their usual standard of care treatment regimen, and their biomarkers of relevance to muscle function such as serum calcium (SC), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels along with functional improvement criteria, which is, Medical research council (MRC) scale and North Star Ambulatory assessment (NSAA), assessed at baseline and following the intervention. After the intervention, the SC levels significantly decreased from a mean baseline value of 9.28 mg/dL to 8.31 mg/dL (p-value = 0.02). With a p-value of 0.29, the mean CPK value dropped from 2192.33 IU/L to 1567.5 IU/L. Following the intervention, the ALP levels dropped from 200.33 to 75.5 U/L (p-value = 0.15). MRC scale improved in three out of six patients. NSAA remained stable. There were no adverse effects. This study has proven the safety of Neu REFIX beta-glucan food supplement and its efficacy in improving both plasma biomarkers and functional parameters of muscle in a short duration of 2 months. Further validation by evaluation of muscle function for a longer duration is recommended to confirm the efficacy of Neu-REFIX food supplement as a potential adjuvant DMT in muscular dystrophies."

Therapeutic strategies feature corticosteroids or the more recent gene therapy/stop codon read-through. Ataluren (Translarna<sup>®</sup>) is an oral drug promoting the readthrough of premature stop codons caused by nonsense mutation (nm) in order to produce full-length dystrophin. It was licensed by EMA in 2014 for ambulatory patients with nmDMD aged ≥ 5 years. Our aim is to report data on long-term ataluren use in Italian patients with nmDMD, with emphasis on continuity of the treatment after loss of ambulation (LoA). Four DMD patients aged between 16 and 24 years who lost ambulation between 12 and 14 years continued to take ataluren after LoA. The oldest patient, aged 24 years, is still taking a few steps. Even in those experiencing motor decline, PUL-test performances were stable and respiratory function satisfactory in all; two patients developed severe cardiomyopathy, stable in one. Therapeutic continuity with ataluren should be offered to all nmDMD patients after LoA given its favourable safety and efficacy profile. However, further research is recommended to identify additional clinically meaningful outcomes and treatment goals following LoA."

    "abstract": "Due to respiratory weakness, late-stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients may suffer from chronic aspiration, which is sometimes treated using tracheostomy. However, definitive laryngectomy has not been described in the literature as an aspiration prevention modality in DMD, especially in patients with contraindications to tracheostomy. A case is presented for a patient with advanced stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy suffering from chronic aspiration pneumonia and excessive oral secretions who became ventilator dependent. A tracheostomy was placed, but was noted to have excessive secretions and high cuff pressures, which have been known to be associated with worsened swallow dysfunction as well as tracheoinnominate fistula. The patient therefore was considered for total laryngectomy, which he underwent successfully. Post-operatively, the patient was noted to have improved subjective quality of life, engaged in an oral diet, and had less secretions surrounding his tracheostoma post-operatively. Aspiration prevention surgeries are done to improve quality of life by improving oral intake, decreasing the need for frequent suctioning, and can sometimes allow for speech. It is important to consider quality of life for DMD patients as more of these patients are living into their 30s with the aid of mechanical ventilation. Laryngectomy is a surgery that can definitively correct chronic aspiration while allowing for oral intake. Laryngoscope, 134:3677-3678, 2024."

    "abstract": "Estimation of temporospatial clinical features of gait (CFs), such as step count and length, step duration, step frequency, gait speed, and distance traveled, is an important component of community-based mobility evaluation using wearable accelerometers. However, accurate unsupervised computerized measurement of CFs of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who have progressive loss of ambulatory mobility is difficult due to differences in patterns and magnitudes of acceleration across their range of attainable gait velocities. This paper proposes a novel calibration method. It aims to detect steps, estimate stride lengths, and determine travel distance. The approach involves a combination of clinical observation, machine-learning-based step detection, and regression-based stride length prediction. The method demonstrates high accuracy in children with DMD and typically developing controls (TDs) regardless of the participant's level of ability. Fifteen children with DMD and fifteen TDs underwent supervised clinical testing across a range of gait speeds using 10 m or 25 m run/walk (10 MRW, 25 MRW), 100 m run/walk (100 MRW), 6-min walk (6 MWT), and free-walk (FW) evaluations while wearing a mobile-phone-based accelerometer at the waist near the body's center of mass. Following calibration by a trained clinical evaluator, CFs were extracted from the accelerometer data using a multi-step machine-learning-based process and the results were compared to ground-truth observation data. Model predictions vs. observed values for step counts, distance traveled, and step length showed a strong correlation (Pearson's r = -0.9929 to 0.9986, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The estimates demonstrated a mean (SD) percentage error of 1.49% (7.04%) for step counts, 1.18% (9.91%) for distance traveled, and 0.37% (7.52%) for step length compared to ground-truth observations for the combined 6 MWT, 100 MRW, and FW tasks. Our study findings indicate that a single waist-worn accelerometer calibrated to an individual's stride characteristics using our methods accurately measures CFs and estimates travel distances across a common range of gait speeds in both DMD and TD peers."

In this work, we measured vertical, mediolateral, and anteroposterior acceleration using a waist-worn iPhone accelerometer during ambulation across a typical range of velocities. Fifteen TD and fifteen DMD children from 3 to 16 years of age underwent eight walking/running activities, including five 25 m walk/run speed-calibration tests at a slow walk to running speeds (SC-L1 to SC-L5), a 6-min walk test (6MWT), a 100 m fast walk/jog/run (100MRW), and a free walk (FW). For clinical anchoring purposes, participants completed a Northstar Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA). We extracted temporospatial gait clinical features (CFs) and applied multiple machine learning (ML) approaches to differentiate between DMD and TD children using extracted temporospatial gait CFs and raw data. Extracted temporospatial gait CFs showed reduced step length and a greater mediolateral component of total power (TP) consistent with shorter strides and Trendelenberg-like gait commonly observed in DMD. ML approaches using temporospatial gait CFs and raw data varied in effectiveness at differentiating between DMD and TD controls at different speeds, with an accuracy of up to 100%. We demonstrate that by using ML with accelerometer data from a consumer-grade smartphone, we can capture DMD-associated gait characteristics in toddlers to teens."

    "abstract": "The microtubule (MT) network plays a major role in the transport of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 to the membrane, where the latter associates with interacting proteins such as dystrophin. Alterations in MT dynamics are known to impact on ion channel trafficking. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by dystrophin deficiency, is associated with an increase in MT detyrosination, decreased sodium current (INa), and arrhythmias. Parthenolide (PTL), a compound that decreases MT detyrosination, has shown beneficial effects on cardiac function in DMD. We here investigated its impact on INa and Nav1.5 subcellular distribution. Ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs) from wild-type (WT) and mdx (DMD) mice were incubated with either 10 µM PTL, 20 µM EpoY, or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for 3-5 h, followed by patch-clamp analysis to assess INa and action potential (AP) characteristics in addition to immunofluorescence and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to investigate MT detyrosination and Nav1.5 cluster size and density, respectively. In accordance with previous studies, we observed increased MT detyrosination, decreased INa and reduced AP upstroke velocity (Vmax) in mdx CMs compared to WT. PTL decreased MT detyrosination and significantly increased INa magnitude (without affecting INa gating properties) and AP Vmax in mdx CMs, but had no effect in WT CMs. Moreover, STORM analysis showed that in mdx CMs, Nav1.5 clusters were decreased not only in the grooves of the lateral membrane (LM; where dystrophin is localized) but also at the LM crests. PTL restored Nav1.5 clusters at the LM crests (but not at the grooves), indicating a dystrophin-independent trafficking route to this subcellular domain. Interestingly, Nav1.5 cluster density was also reduced at the intercalated disc (ID) region of mdx CMs, which was restored to WT levels by PTL. Treatment of mdx CMs with EpoY, a specific MT detyrosination inhibitor, also increased INa density, while decreasing the amount of detyrosinated MTs, confirming a direct mechanistic link. Attenuating MT detyrosination in mdx CMs restored INa and enhanced Nav1.5 localization at the LM crest and ID. Hence, the reduced whole-cell INa density characteristic of mdx CMs is not only the consequence of the lack of dystrophin within the LM grooves but is also due to reduced Nav1.5 at the LM crest and ID secondary to increased baseline MT detyrosination. Overall, our findings identify MT detyrosination as a potential therapeutic target for modulating INa and subcellular Nav1.5 distribution in pathophysiological conditions."

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases."

    "title": "Metastasis-associated 1 localizes to the sarcomeric Z-disc and is implicated in skeletal muscle pathology.",
    "abstract": "Metastasis-associated 1 (MTA1), a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) corepressor complex, was reported to be expressed in the cytoplasm of skeletal muscles. However, the exact subcellular localization and the functional implications of MTA1 in skeletal muscles have not been examined. This study aims to demonstrate the subcellular localization of MTA1 in skeletal muscles and reveal its possible roles in skeletal muscle pathogenesis. Striated muscles (skeletal and cardiac) from C57BL/6 mice of 4-5 weeks were collected to examine the expression of MTA1 by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy were performed for MTA1, α-actinin (a Z-disc marker protein), and SMN (survival of motor neuron) proteins. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets were analyzed using the GEO2R online tool to explore the functional implications of MTA1 in skeletal muscles. MTA1 expression was detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Subcellular localization of MTA1 was found in the Z-disc of sarcomeres, where α-actinin and SMN were expressed. Data mining of GEO profiles suggested that MTA1 dysregulation is associated with multiple skeletal muscle defects, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, nemaline myopathy, and dermatomyositis. The GEO analysis also showed that MTA1 expression gradually decreased with age in mouse skeletal muscle precursor cells. The subcellular localization of MTA1 in sarcomeres of skeletal muscles implies its biological roles in sarcomere structures and its possible contribution to skeletal muscle pathology."

    "abstract": "In this prospective study involving 37 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients aged 8-18 years and older, we examined the impact of neurological and cardiac factors on quality of life (QoL). Our findings revealed a negative correlation between upper limb movement and overall mobility, self-service, and usual activities. Ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD patients showed significant differences in mobility-related parameters. Cardiac evaluations demonstrated associations between mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) and mobility-related aspects. The PEDSQL 3.0 neuromuscular model questionnaire further highlighted age-related and movement-related correlations with QoL. The loss of ambulatory status and reduced upper limb movement were negatively associated with QoL, while upper limb movement positively correlated with septal MAPSE. However, no significant associations were found between MAPSE and anxiety/depression. These findings underscore the multifaceted impact of DMD on QoL and emphasize the importance of considering both neurological and cardiac factors in comprehensive patient care."

    "abstract": "Human iPSC-derived 3D-tissue-engineered-skeletal muscles (3D-TESMs) offer advanced technology for disease modelling. However, due to the inherent genetic heterogeneity among human individuals, it is often difficult to distinguish disease-related readouts from random variability. The generation of genetically matched isogenic controls using gene editing can reduce variability, but the generation of isogenic hiPSC-derived 3D-TESMs can take up to 6 months, thereby reducing throughput. Here, by combining 3D-TESM and shRNA technologies, we developed a disease modelling strategy to induce distinct genetic deficiencies in a single hiPSC-derived myogenic progenitor cell line within 1 week. As proof of principle, we recapitulated disease-associated pathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A caused by loss of function of DMD and CAPN3, respectively. shRNA-mediated knock down of DMD or CAPN3 induced a loss of contractile function, disruption of tissue architecture, and disease-specific proteomes. Pathology in DMD-deficient 3D-TESMs was partially rescued by a candidate gene therapy treatment using micro-dystrophin, with similar efficacy compared to animal models. These results show that isogenic shRNA-based humanized 3D-TESM models provide a fast, cheap, and efficient tool to model muscular dystrophies and are useful for the preclinical evaluation of novel therapies."

    "title": "The muscle regeneration marker FOXP3 is associated with muscle injury in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the immune system cells (ISC) synthesize molecules to regulate inflammation, a process needed to regenerate muscle. The relationship between those molecules and the muscle injury is unknown. Monocytes belonging to ISC are regulated by omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 LCPUFAs) in DMD, but whether those fatty acids influence other ISC like T-cells is unknown. We analyzed the expression of the muscle regeneration markers (FOXP3 and AREG) in circulating leukocytes of DMD patients with different lower limb muscle functions and whether ω-3 LCPUFAs regulate the expression of those markers, and the populations of circulating T-cells, their intracellular cytokines, and disease progression (CD69 and CD49d) markers. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study was conducted in DMD boys supplemented with ω-3 LCPUFAs (n = 18) or placebo (sunflower oil, n = 13) for six months. FOXP3 and AREG mRNA expression in leukocytes, immunophenotyping of T-cell populations, CD49d and CD69 markers, and intracellular cytokines in blood samples were analyzed at baseline and months 1, 2, 3, and 6 of supplementation. Patients with assisted ambulation expressed higher (P = 0.015) FOXP3 mRNA levels than ambulatory patients. The FOXP3 mRNA expression correlated (Rho = -0.526, P = 0.03) with the Vignos scale score at month six of supplementation with ω-3 LCPUFAs. CD49d + CD8 + T-cells population was lower (P = 0.037) in the ω -3 LCPUFAs group than placebo at month six of supplementation. FOXP3 is highly expressed in circulating leukocytes of DMD patients with the worst muscle function. Omega-3 LCPUFAs might modulate the synthesis of the adhesion marker CD49d + CD8 + T-cells, but their plausible impact on FOXP3 needs more research."

    "abstract": "Rare muscular disorders (RMDs) are disorders that affect a small percentage of the population. The disorders which are attributed to genetic mutations often manifest in the form of progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal and heart muscles. RMDs includes disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), GNE myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and so on. Due to the infrequent occurrence of these disorders, development of therapeutic approaches elicits less attention compared with other more prevalent diseases. However, in recent times, improved understanding of pathogenesis has led to greater advances in developing therapeutic options to treat such diseases. Exon skipping, gene augmentation, and gene editing have taken the spotlight in drug development for rare neuromuscular disorders. The recent innovation in targeting and repairing mutations with the advent of CRISPR technology has in fact opened new possibilities in the development of gene therapy approaches for these disorders. Although these treatments show satisfactory therapeutic effects, the susceptibility to degradation, instability, and toxicity limits their application. So, an appropriate delivery vector is required for the delivery of these cargoes. Viral vectors are considered potential delivery systems for gene therapy; however, the associated concurrent immunogenic response and other limitations have paved the way for the applications of other non-viral systems like lipids, polymers, cellpenetrating peptides (CPPs), and other organic and inorganic materials. This review will focus on non-viral vectors for the delivery of therapeutic cargoes in order to treat muscular dystrophies."

    "abstract": "This paper details the results of an evaluation of the level of consensus amongst clinicians on the use of ataluren in both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients with nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD). The consensus was derived using a modified Delphi methodology that involved an exploration phase and then an evaluation phase. The exploration phase involved 90-minute virtual 1:1 interviews of 12 paediatric neurologists who cared for 30-120 DMD patients each and had patient contact every one or two weeks. The respondents managed one to ten nmDMD patients taking ataluren. The Discussion Guide for the interviews can be viewed as Appendix A. Following the exploration phase interviews, the interview transcripts were analysed by an independent party to identify common themes, views and opinions and developed 43 draft statements that the Steering Group (authors) reviewed, refined and endorsed a final list of 42 statements. Details of the recruitment of participants for the exploration and evaluation phases can be found under the Methods section. A consensus was agreed (> 66% of respondents agreeing) for 41 of the 42 statements using results from a consensus survey of healthcare professionals (n = 20) experienced in the treatment of nmDMD. The statements with a high consensus suggest that treatment with ataluren should be initiated as soon as possible to delay disease progression and allow patients to remain ambulatory for as long as possible. Ataluren is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy that results from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene, in ambulatory patients aged 2 years and older (see Summary of Product Characteristics for each country)."

The precise genetic diagnosis is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment, multidisciplinary management, genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and selection of gene therapy in dystrophinopathy. The present guideline is primarily based on the research advances in dystrophinopathy. Meanwhile, the foreign and domestic clinical guidelines or consensus for dystrophinopathy were referenced to put forward 18 recommendations and reach a consensus on the clinical manifestations, genetic basis, clinical diagnosis and classification, genetic diagnosis, and clinical genetic counseling of dystrophinopathy. This guideline aims to standardize and optimize the diagnostic process and reduce the diagnostic difficulty of patients with dystrophinopathy.

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To explore the characteristics and changes of cardiac injury with age in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and its clinical significance. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective cohort study was conducted. The 215 patients diagnosed with DMD in West China Second Hospital from January 2019 to November 2022 and aged from 6 to 18 years were enrolled. Their clinical data, myocardial injury markers, routine electrocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiography were collected. The patients were divided into five age groups: 6-<8, 8-<10, 10-<12, 12-<14 and 14-18 years of age, and matched with healthy boys respectively. Independent sample <i>t</i> test or Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test was used to compare the clinical data and CMR indexes between DMD patients and controls in all age subgroups, and to compare the value of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by echocardiography and CMR in each subgroup of DMD patitents. Pearson correlation analysis or Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relation between the CMR indexes and age in DMD patients. <b>Results:</b> A total of 215 patients with DMD (all male) and 122 healthy boys were included in the study. There were 75 DMD patients and 23 controls in 6-<8 years of age group, 77 DMD and 28 controls in 8-<10 years of age group, 39 DMD and 23 controls in 10-<12 years of age group, 10 DMD and 31 controls in the 12-<14 years of age group, and 14 DMD and 17 controls in 14-18 years of age group. In the DMD patients, the older the age, the lower the levels of creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB). In the 6-<8 years of age group, the CK level was 10 760 (7 800, 15 757) U/L, while in the group of 14-18 years of age, it was 2 369 (1 480, 6 944) U/L. As for CK-MB, it was (189±17) μg/L in the 6-<8 years of age group and (62±16) μg/L in the 14-18 years of age group. Cardiac troponin I remained unchanged in <12 years of age groups, but significantly increased in 12-<14 years of age group, reaching the highest value of 0.112 (0.006, 0.085) μg/L. In the DMD patients, the older the age, the higher the proportion of abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG). In the 6-<8 years of age group, the proportion is 29.3% (22/75), while in the 14-18 years of age group, it was 10/14. Correlation analysis showed that the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was positively related with age (<i>r</i>=0.18, <i>P</i>=0.015), and the left ventricular stroke volume index and cardiac output index were negatively related with age (<i>r</i>=-0.34 and -0.31, respectively, both <i>P</i><0.001). In the DMD patients, the older the age, the lower LVEF, with the LVEF decreasing to (49.3±3.1)% in the 14-18 years of age group. The LVEF of DMD cases was significantly lower than that of controls in the age subgroups of 8-<10, 10-<12, 12-<14 and 14-18 years of age groups ((57.9±5.2) % <i>vs.</i> (63.6±0.8)%, 60.7% (55.9%, 61.9%) <i>vs.</i> 63.7% (60.2%, 66.0%), 57.1% (51.8%, 63.4%) <i>vs.</i> 62.1 % (59.5%, 64.5)%, (49.3±3.1) % <i>vs.</i> (61.6±1.3)%, respectively; all <i>P</i><0.01). In the DMD patients, the older the age, the higher the proportion of positive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). In the 6-<8 years of age group, it was 22% (11/51), in the 12-<14 years of age group, it was 13/14, and in the 14-18 years of age group, all DMD showed positive LGE. The value of LVEF of DMD cases measured by echocardiography was significantly higher than that measured by CMR in 6-<8 years of age group and 8-<10 years of age group (63.2% (60.1%, 66.4%) <i>vs.</i> 59.1 % (55.4%, 62.9%), and (62.8±5.2) % <i>vs.</i> (57.9±5.2)%, all <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> DMD patients develop cardiac injury in the early stage of the disease, and the incidence of cardiac damage gradually increases with both age and the progression of disease."

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most prevalent X-linked inherited neuromuscular disorders, with an estimated incidence between 1 in 3500 and 5000 live male births. The median life expectancy at birth is around 30 years due to a rapid and severe disease progression. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, and the standard of care is mainly palliative therapy and glucocorticoids to mitigate symptoms and improve quality of life. Recent advances in phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (PMO) technology has proven optimistic in providing a disease-modifying therapy rather than a palliative treatment option through correcting the primary genetic defect of DMD by exon skipping. However, as a result of the high variance in mutations of the dystrophin gene causing DMD, it has been challenging to tailor an effective therapy in most patients. Viltolarsen is effective in 8% of patients and accurately skips exon 53, reestablishing the reading frame and producing a functional form of dystrophin and milder disease phenotype. Results of recently concluded preclinical and clinical trials show significantly increased dystrophin protein expression, no severe adverse effects, and stabilization of motor function. In summary, viltolarsen has provided hope for those working toward giving patients a safe and viable treatment option for managing DMD. This review summarizes an overview of the presentation, pathophysiology, genetics, and current treatment guidelines of DMD, pharmacological profile of viltolarsen, and a summary of the safety and efficacy with additional insights using recent clinical trial data."

Its severity, age at onset, and rate of progression display wide variability, whose molecular bases have been scarcely elucidated. Potential DCM-modifying factors include glucocorticoid (GC) and cardiological treatments, DMD mutation type and location, and variants in other genes. We retrospectively collected 3138 echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), shortening fraction (SF), and end-diastolic volume (EDV) from 819 DMD participants, 541 from an Italian multicentric cohort and 278 from the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS). Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, we estimated the yearly rate of decrease of EF (-0.80%) and SF (-0.41%), while EDV increase was not significantly associated with age. Utilizing a multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) model we observed that mutations preserving the expression of the C-terminal Dp71 isoform of dystrophin were correlated with decreased EDV (-11.01 mL/m2, p = 0.03) while for dp116 were correlated with decreased EF (-4.14%, p = <0.001). The rs10880 genotype in the LTBP4 gene, previously shown to prolong ambulation, was also associated with increased EF and decreased EDV (+3.29%, p = 0.002, and -10.62 mL/m2, p = 0.008) with a recessive model. We quantitatively describe the progression of systolic dysfunction progression in DMD, confirm the effect of distal dystrophin isoform expression on the dystrophin-deficient heart, and identify a strong effect of LTBP4 genotype of DCM in DMD."

This pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a co-designed weight management program for DMD. The Supporting Nutrition and Optimizing Wellbeing Program (SNOW-P) was a single-arm diet and behavior weight management intervention delivered via weekly telehealth/phone visits over 6 weeks to young people with DMD and obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥95th percentile) and their caregivers. Using an online survey, caregivers of boys with DMD were consulted on the structure and topics delivered in SNOW-P. Primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability; secondary outcomes were weight, physical function, and quality of life at 6- and 12-weeks follow-up. Of nineteen eligible participants, eight were enrolled (median age 11.4 years, range 4.9-15.8), and seven completed the program. Visit attendance was high (88%-100%); most participants reported high satisfaction and that participation was easy. Suggested changes included online and visual DMD-specific resources. At 6-weeks, median change in weight z-scores was -0.01 (IQR: -0.23, 0.17) indicating that on average, weight gain tracked as expected for age. Waist circumference measured by caregivers lacked accuracy and the completion rate of caregiver-reported secondary outcome measures (e.g., food diaries) was low. A co-designed, telehealth/phone weight management program appeared to be feasible and acceptable in a small group of boys with DMD.

This study aims to: explore barriers, enablers, attitudes, and beliefs about nutrition and weight management; and to obtain caregiver preferences for the design of a weight management program for DMD. We surveyed caregivers of young people with DMD from four Australian pediatric neuromuscular clinics. Survey questions were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework and purposefully designed to explore barriers and enablers to food and weight management. Caregivers were asked to identify their preferred features in a weight management program for families living with DMD. Fifty-three caregivers completed the survey. Almost half (48%) perceived their son as above healthy weight. Consequences for those children were perceived to be self-consciousness (71%), a negative impact on self-esteem (64%) and movement (57%). Preventing weight gain was a common reason for providing healthy food and healthy eating was a high priority for families. Barriers to that intention included: time constraints, selective food preferences, and insufficient nutrition information. Caregivers preferred an intensive six-week weight management program addressing appetite management and screen time. Managing weight is an important issue for caregivers of sons with DMD; yet several barriers exist. Individualized 6 week programs are preferred by caregivers to improve weight management for DMD."

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy. Additionally, patients with DMD have significant reductions in bone mineral density compared to age-matched controls, which is exacerbated by concomitant steroid use. These findings dramatically increase fracture risk, which may irreparably decrease functional status. The aim of this case series is to examine outcomes of operative versus nonoperative management of femur fractures in this patient population.<b>Methods:</b> An IRB-approved retrospective chart review was completed for patients with DMD treated at a single institution for a femur fracture between 2013-2022. Patients were excluded for incomplete documentation, treatment initiation at an outside hospital, or diagnosis of a different muscular dystrophy. Demographic variables, treatment information, functional status, and adverse events were collected for each patient. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and outcome variables.<b>Results:</b> A total of 10 patients with 11 femur fractures were included for analysis. All patients were male with an average age of 12.7 years and clinical follow-up of 286 days. Five fractures in five patients underwent operative fixation (<b>Group A</b>), and six fractures in five patients underwent nonoperative management (<b>Group B</b>). In Group A, three patients were short-distance ambulators prior to injury, and all patients regained a similar functional status postoperatively. All three patients were treated with a locked intramedullary nail. One patient in Group B was a short-distance ambulator prior to injury; the remainder were nonambulatory. All patients in Group B were primary wheelchair users at final follow-up. There were no adverse events as a result of treatment in either group.<b>Conclusion:</b> Nonoperative management with cast immobilization remains an acceptable option for nonambulatory patients and those with minimally displaced fractures not amenable to surgical intervention. Surgical intervention is recommended for higher-functioning patients with the goal of restoring ambulatory status. Regardless of treatment modality, patients should receive aggressive physical therapy directed at early weight-bearing, range of motion, and mobilization to preserve strength, muscle mass, and mobility.<b>Level of Evidence:</b> Level IV case series. •Management of femur fractures in Duchenne muscular dystrophy should account for fracture morphology as well as patient functional status.•Surgical management is safe and effective in promoting fracture union and preserving functional status.•Nonoperative management is preferred in nonambulatory patients and for minimally displaced fractures."

    "title": "Design requirements of upper extremity supports for daily use in Duchenne muscular dystrophy with severe muscle weakness.",
    "abstract": "People with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cope with progressive muscular weakness and consequential upper extremity function loss. They benefit from arm supports, or arm exoskeletons, to assist arm function. Especially for severe muscle weakness (DMD ≥ Brooke Scale 4), the design of such arm support is challenging. This study aims to structurally develop functional and technical design requirements of arm supports for people with DMD Brooke Scale 4. An overview of clinical characteristics and a classification of clinically meaningful activities were derived from data from the Dutch Dystrophinopathy Database and available literature. Based on these, functional and technical design requirements of arm supports were developed and matched to the achievable needs of the user. First, the clinical characteristics of the target population, such as strength, range of motion, and functional ability, are given. Next, clinically relevant activities of daily living are translated to functional requirements categorised in a 'must,' 'should,' and 'could' category. Last, the technical requirements to realise these functional goals are presented. The recommendations following from the functional user needs, technical requirements, and safety considerations can be used to make the development of assistive arm supports for people with DMD Brooke Scale 4 more user-centred."

    "title": "Induced degeneration and regeneration in aged muscle reduce tubular aggregates but not muscle function.",
    "abstract": "Tubular aggregates (TA) are skeletal muscle structures that arise from the progressive accumulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins. Cytoplasmic aggregates in muscle fibers have already been observed in mice and humans, mainly during aging and muscle disease processes. However, the effects of muscle regeneration on TA formation have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between degeneration/regeneration and TA in aged murine models. We investigated the presence and quantity of TA in old males from two murine models with intense muscle degeneration and regeneration. One murine lineage was a <i>Dmd</i><sup><i>mdx</i></sup> model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<i>n</i> = 6). In the other model, muscle damage was induced by electroporation in C57BL/6J wild-type mice, and analyzed after 5, 15, and 30 days post-electroporation (dpe; <i>n</i> = 15). Regeneration was evaluated based on the quantity of developmental myosin heavy chain (dMyHC)-positive fibers. The frequency of fibers containing TA was higher in aged C57BL/6J (26 ± 8.3%) than in old dystrophic <i>Dmd</i><sup><i>mdx</i></sup> mice (2.4 ± 2%). Comparing the data from induced degeneration/regeneration in normal mice revealed a reduced proportion of TA-containing fibers after 5 and 30 dpe. Normal aged muscle was able to regenerate and form dMyHC+ fibers, mainly at 5 dpe (0.1 ± 0.1 vs. 16.5 ± 2.6%). However, there was no difference in force or resistance between normal and 30 dpe animals, except for the measurements by the Actimeter device, which showed the worst parameters in the second group. Our results suggest that TA also forms in the <i>Dmd</i><sup><i>mdx</i></sup> muscle but in smaller amounts. The intense degeneration and regeneration of the old dystrophic model resulted in the generation of new muscle fibers with a lower quantity of TA. Data from electroporated wild-type mice support the idea that muscle regeneration leads to a reduction in the amount of TA. We suggest that TA accumulates in muscle fibers throughout physiological aging and that regeneration leads to the formation of new fibers without these structures. In addition, these new fibers do not confer functional benefits to the muscle."

    "abstract": "It has long been reported that neuropsychological deficits may be present in dystrophinopathies, specifically non-progressive cognitive impairment and a global deficit in executive functions; this neurocognitive profile has been less explored in patients with Becker than Duchenne muscular dystrophy (BMD/DMD). We conducted a longitudinal study to explore the evolution of neuropsychological and behavioural profile in a cohort of paediatric BMD. Seventeen patients with BMD without intellectual disability were assessed using a full battery of tests, including intellectual, adaptive and executive functioning, language and behavioral features. Tests were performed at baseline and after 12 months. The results showed adequate cognitive and adaptive profile with falls in Working Memory, as well as lower scores in executive functions. An improvement was observed in Processing Speed. Behavioral questionnaires confirmed a negative trend, while in normal ranges. We found a statistically significant difference between T0 and T1 in some items exploring executive functions. No statistically significant difference was observed stratifying patients by mutation site or IQ level. In conclusion, our study suggests that BMD patients have a stable neurocognitive profile, while a deflection in the executive functions may be observed. We recommend a careful monitoring to intercept learning disabilities and promptly start a multimodal rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "The leading cause of death for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive muscle disease, is heart failure. Prostaglandin (PG) D<sub>2</sub>, a physiologically active fatty acid, is synthesized from the precursor PGH<sub>2</sub> by hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS). Using a DMD animal model (<i>mdx</i> mice), we previously found that HPGDS expression is increased not only in injured muscle but also in the heart. Moreover, HPGDS inhibitors can slow the progression of muscle injury and cardiomyopathy. However, the location of HPGDS in the heart is still unknown. Thus, this study investigated HPGDS expression in autopsy myocardial samples from DMD patients. We confirmed the presence of fibrosis, a characteristic phenotype of DMD, in the autopsy myocardial sections. Additionally, HPGDS was expressed in mast cells, pericytes, and myeloid cells of the myocardial specimens but not in the myocardium. Compared with the non-DMD group, the DMD group showed increased HPGDS expression in mast cells and pericytes. Our findings confirm the possibility of using HPGDS inhibitor therapy to suppress PGD<sub>2</sub> production to treat skeletal muscle disorders and cardiomyopathy. It thus provides significant insights for developing therapeutic drugs for DMD."

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are small regulatory molecules that control gene expression. An emerging property of muscle miRNAs is the cooperative regulation of transcriptional and epitranscriptional events controlling muscle phenotype. miR-155 has been related to muscular dystrophy and muscle cell atrophy. However, the function of miR-155 and its molecular targets in muscular dystrophies remain poorly understood. Through in silico and in vitro approaches, we identify distinct transcriptional profiles induced by miR-155-5p in muscle cells. The treated myotubes changed the expression of 359 genes (166 upregulated and 193 downregulated). We reanalyzed muscle transcriptomic data from dystrophin-deficient patients and detected overlap with gene expression patterns in miR-155-treated myotubes. Our analysis indicated that miR-155 regulates a set of transcripts, including <i>Aldh1l</i>, <i>Nek2</i>, <i>Bub1b</i>, <i>Ramp3</i>, <i>Slc16a4</i>, <i>Plce1</i>, <i>Dync1i1</i>, and <i>Nr1h3</i>. Enrichment analysis demonstrates 20 targets involved in metabolism, cell cycle regulation, muscle cell maintenance, and the immune system. Moreover, digital cytometry confirmed a significant increase in M2 macrophages, indicating miR-155's effects on immune response in dystrophic muscles. We highlight a critical miR-155 associated with disease-related pathways in skeletal muscle disorders."

    "abstract": "Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is characterised by fiber loss and expansion of fibrotic and adipose tissue. Several cells interact locally in what is known as the degenerative niche. We analysed muscle biopsies of controls and BMD patients at early, moderate and advanced stages of progression using Hyperion imaging mass cytometry (IMC) by labelling single sections with 17 markers identifying different components of the muscle. We developed a software for analysing IMC images and studied changes in the muscle composition and spatial correlations between markers across disease progression. We found a strong correlation between collagen-I and the area of stroma, collagen-VI, adipose tissue, and M2-macrophages number. There was a negative correlation between the area of collagen-I and the number of satellite cells (SCs), fibres and blood vessels. The comparison between fibrotic and non-fibrotic areas allowed to study the disease process in detail. We found structural differences among non-fibrotic areas from control and patients, being these latter characterized by increase in CTGF and in M2-macrophages and decrease in fibers and blood vessels. IMC enables to study of changes in tissue structure along disease progression, spatio-temporal correlations and opening the door to better understand new potential pathogenic pathways in human samples."

    "abstract": "Vamorolone is a dissociative agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor that has shown similar efficacy and reduced safety concerns in comparison with prednisone in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of vamorolone over 48 weeks and to study crossover participants (prednisone to vamorolone; placebo to vamorolone). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and prednisone-controlled clinical trial of 2 doses of vamorolone was conducted in participants with DMD, in the ages from 4 years to younger than 7 years at baseline. The interventions were 2 mg/kg/d of vamorolone and 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone for 48 weeks (period 1: 24 weeks + period 2: 24 weeks) and 0.75 mg/kg/d of prednisone and placebo for the first 24 weeks (before crossover). Efficacy was evaluated through gross motor outcomes and safety through adverse events, growth velocity, body mass index (BMI), and bone turnover biomarkers. This analysis focused on period 2. A total of 121 participants with DMD were randomized. Vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d showed maintenance of improvement for all motor outcomes to week 48 (e.g., for primary outcome, time to stand from supine [TTSTAND] velocity, week 24 least squares mean [LSM] [SE] 0.052 [0.0130] rises/s vs week 48 LSM [SE] 0.0446 [0.0138]). After 48 weeks, vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d showed similar improvements as 6 mg/kg/d for North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) (vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d-vamorolone 2 mg/kg/d LSM [SE] 0.49 [1.14]; 95% CI -1.80 to 2.78, <i>p</i> = 0.67), but less improvement for other motor outcomes. The placebo to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d group showed rapid improvements after 20 weeks of treatment approaching benefit seen with 48-week 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone treatment for TTSTAND, time to run/walk 10 m, and NSAA. There was significant improvement in linear growth after crossover in the prednisone to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d group, and rapid reversal of prednisone-induced decline in bone turnover biomarkers in both crossover groups. There was an increase in BMI after 24 weeks of treatment that then stabilized for both vamorolone groups. Improvements of motor outcomes seen with 6 mg/kg/d of vamorolone at 24 weeks of treatment were maintained to 48 weeks of treatment. Vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d showed better maintenance of effect compared with vamorolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d for most (3/5) motor outcomes. Bone morbidities of prednisone (stunting of growth and declines in serum bone biomarkers) were reversed when treatment transitioned to vamorolone. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03439670. This study provides Class I evidence that for boys with DMD, the efficacy of vamorolone at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d was maintained over 48 weeks."

    "abstract": "Myocardial hypoxia has been demonstrated in many cardiomyopathies and is related to development of myocardial fibrosis. However, myocardial hypoxia and its association with myocardial fibrosis are understudied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)-associated cardiomyopathy. To evaluate myocardial hypoxia by oxygenation-sensitive (OS) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and further explore its association with fibrosis. Prospective. Ninety-one DMD boys (8.78 ± 2.32) and 30 healthy boys (9.07 ± 2.30). 3 T, Balanced steady-state free procession, Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence and Single-shot phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence. Cardiac MRI data, including left ventricular functional, segmental native T1, and oxygenation signal-intensity (SI) according to AHA 17-segment model, were acquired. Patients were divided into LGE+ and LGE- groups. In patients with LGE, all segments were further classified as positive or negative segments by segmentally presence/absence of LGE. Variables were compared using Student's t, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis test and one-way analysis of variance. Bivariate Pearson or Spearman correlation were calculated to determine association between oxygenation SI and native T1. Variables with P < 0.10 in the univariable analysis were included in multivariable model. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the performance of OS in diagnosing myocardial hypoxia. The myocardial oxygenation SI of DMD was significantly decreased in all segments compared with normal controls, and more obvious in the LGE+ segments (0.46 ± 0.03 vs. 0.52 ± 0.03). For patients with and without LGE, myocardial oxygenation SI were significantly negatively correlated with native T1 in all segments (r = -0.23 to -0.42). The inferolateral oxygenation SI was a significant independent associator of LGE presence (adjusted OR = 0.900). Myocardial hypoxia evaluated by the OS-Cardiac-MRI indeed occurs in DMD and associate with myocardial fibrosis, which might be used as a biomarker in assessing myocardial damage in DMD. 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1."

    "abstract": "Intramuscular injection of Wnt7a has been shown to accelerate and augment skeletal muscle regeneration and to ameliorate dystrophic progression in <i>mdx</i> muscle, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, loss-of-function studies to investigate the requirement for Wnt7a in muscle regeneration has not been evaluated. Here, we assessed muscle regeneration and function in wild type (WT) and <i>mdx</i> mice where Wnt7a was specifically deleted in muscle using a conditional <i>Wnt7a</i> floxed allele and a <i>Myf5-Cre</i> driver. We found that both WT and <i>mdx</i> mice with deletion of Wnt7a in muscle, exhibited marked deficiencies in muscle regeneration at 21 d following cardiotoxin (CTX) induced injury. Unlike WT, deletion of Wnt7a in <i>mdx</i> resulted in a marked decrease in specific force generation prior to CTX injury. However, both WT and <i>mdx</i> muscle lacking Wnt7a displayed decreased specific force generation following CTX injection. Notably the regeneration deficit observed in <i>mdx</i> mice lacking Wnt7a in muscle was rescued by a single tail vein injection of an extracellular vesicle preparation containing Wnt7a (Wnt7a-EVs). Therefore, we conclude that the regenerative capacity of muscle in <i>mdx</i> mice is due to the upregulation of endogenous Wnt7a following injury, and that systemic delivery of Wnt7a-EVs represents a therapeutic strategy for treating DMD."

In this nonhuman primate study, we investigated the impact of immunosuppression strategies on gene transfer therapy safety and efficacy and analyzed plasmapheresis as a potential pretreatment for circumvention of pre-existing immunity or redosing. In part 1, animals received delandistrogene moxeparvovec (SRP-9001), an AAVrh74-based gene transfer therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Cohort 1 (control, n = 2) received no immunosuppression; cohorts 2-4 (n = 3 per cohort) received prednisone at different time points; and cohort 5 (n = 3) received rituximab, sirolimus, and prednisone before and after dosing. In part 2, cohorts 2-4 underwent plasmapheresis before redosing; cohort 5 was redosed without plasmapheresis. We analyzed safety, immune response (humoral and cell-mediated responses and complement activation), and vector genome distribution. After 2 or 3 plasmapheresis exchanges, circulating anti-AAVrh74 antibodies were reduced, and animals were redosed. Plasmapheresis was well tolerated, with no abnormal clinical or immunological observations. Cohort 5 (redosed with high anti-AAVrh74 antibody titers) had hypersensitivity reactions, which were controlled with treatment. These findings suggest that plasmapheresis is a safe and effective method to reduce anti-AAV antibody levels in nonhuman primates prior to gene transfer therapy. The results may inform human studies involving redosing or circumvention of pre-existing immunity."

In this study, we present foundational work on 3D cultured muscle ultrastructure, with and without motor neurons, which is enabled by the development of a new co-culture platform. Our results show that tissues from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients are poorly organized compared to tissues grown from healthy donor and that the presence of motor neurons invariably improves sarcomere organization. Electron micrographs show that in the presence of motor neurons, filament directionality, banding patterns, z-disc continuity, and the appearance of presumptive SSR and T-tubule profiles all improve in healthy, DMD-, and iPSC-derived muscle tissue. Further work to identify the underlying defects of DMD tissue disorganization and the mechanisms by which motor neurons support muscle are likely to yield potential new therapeutic approaches for treating patients suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

However, the large size and multicomponent nature of prime editing systems pose substantial production and delivery issues. Here, we report that packaging optimized full-length prime editing constructs in adenovector particles (AdVPs) permits installing precise DMD edits in human myogenic cells, namely, myoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (up to 80% and 64%, respectively). AdVP transductions identified optimized prime-editing reagents capable of correcting DMD reading frames of ∼14% of patient genotypes and restoring dystrophin synthesis and dystrophin-β-dystroglycan linkages in unselected DMD muscle cell populations. AdVPs were equally suitable for correcting DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and delivering dual prime editors tailored for DMD repair through targeted exon 51 deletion. Moreover, by exploiting the cell cycle-independent AdVP transduction process, we report that 2- and 3-component prime-editing modalities are both most active in cycling than in post-mitotic cells. Finally, we establish that combining AdVP transduction with seamless prime editing allows for stacking chromosomal edits through successive delivery rounds. In conclusion, AdVPs permit versatile investigation of advanced prime editing systems independently of their size and component numbers, which should facilitate their screening and application."

This therapy was developed to address the underlying cause of DMD through targeted skeletal, respiratory, and cardiac muscle expression of delandistrogene moxeparvovec micro-dystrophin, an engineered, functional dystrophin protein. Drawing on clinical trial experience from Study 101 (NCT03375164), Study 102 (NCT03769116), and ENDEAVOR (Study 103; NCT04626674), we outline practical considerations for delandistrogene moxeparvovec treatment. Before infusion, the following are recommended: (1) screen for anti-adeno-associated virus rhesus isolate serotype 74 total binding antibody titers <1:400; (2) assess liver function, platelet count, and troponin-I; (3) ensure patients are up to date with vaccinations and avoid vaccine coadministration with infusion; (4) administer additional corticosteroids starting one day preinfusion (for patients already on corticosteroids); and (5) postpone dosing patients with any infection or acute liver disease until event resolution. Postinfusion, the following are recommended: (1) monitor liver function weekly (three months postinfusion) and, if indicated, continue until results are unremarkable; (2) monitor troponin-I levels weekly (first month postinfusion, continuing if indicated); (3) obtain platelet counts weekly (two weeks postinfusion), continuing if indicated; and (4) maintain the corticosteroid regimen for at least 60 days postinfusion, unless earlier tapering is indicated. Although the clinical safety profile of delandistrogene moxeparvovec has been consistent, monitorable, and manageable, these practical considerations may mitigate potential risks in a real-world clinical practice setting."

Clinical information of the female proband, her monozygotic twin sister, and other family members were collected. Potential pathogenic variants were detected with Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (HhaI) was employed for X-chromosome inactivation analysis. The proband was a female over 5 years old, displayed clinical manifestations such as elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and mild calf muscle hypertrophy. Her monozygotic twin sister exhibited normal CK levels and motor ability. Her uncle and cousin had a history of DMD. WES revealed that the proband carried a novel variant in the DMD (OMIM: 300,377) gene: NM_004006.3: c.3051_3053dup; NP_003997.2: p.Tyr1018*. In this pedigree, five out of six female members were carriers of this variant, while the cousin and uncle were hemizygous for this variant. X-chromosome inactivation analysis suggested non-random inactivation in the proband. The c.3051_3053dup (p.Tyr1018*) variant in the DMD gene is considered to be the pathogenic variant significantly associated with the clinical phenotype of the proband, her cousin, and her uncle within this family. Integrating genetic testing with clinical phenotype assessment can be a valuable tool for physicians in the diagnosis of progressive muscular dystrophies, such as Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)."

There are multiple ongoing clinical trials for DMD that are testing gene therapy treatments consisting of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors carrying miniaturized versions of dystrophin optimized for function, termed micro-dystrophins (μDys). Utrophin, the fetal homolog of dystrophin, has repeatedly been reported to be upregulated in human DMD muscle as a compensatory mechanism, but whether µDys displaces full-length utrophin is unknown. In this study, dystrophin/utrophin-deficient mice with transgenic overexpression of full-length utrophin in skeletal muscles were systemically administered low doses of either AAV6-CK8e-Hinge3-µDys (μDysH3) or AAV6-CK8e-μDys5 (μDys5). We used immunofluorescence to qualitatively assess the localization of μDys with transgenic utrophin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in quadriceps muscles. μDys protein resulting from both gene therapies co-localized at myofiber membranes with transgenic utrophin. We also confirmed the sarcolemmal co-localization of nNOS with μDys5, but not with transgenic utrophin expression or μDysH3. Transgenic utrophin expression and μDys proteins produced from both therapies stabilize the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex as observed by sarcolemmal localization of β-dystroglycan. This study suggests that µDys gene therapy will likely not inhibit any endogenous compensation by utrophin in DMD muscle."

Although our preoperative diagnosis was a solitary fibrous tumor originating from the mediastinum or diaphragm, intraoperative thoracoscopy revealed the tumor arising from the left lower lobe without adhesion to the other organs. Considering his medical history, we aimed to preserve lung function and chose wedge resection, which completely removed the tumor. Based on the pathological findings, the tumor was diagnosed as low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma with massive calcification originating from the lung.

Because decreased autophagy has been reported to contribute to skeletal muscle degeneration, therapies targeting autophagy are expected to improve skeletal muscle hypofunction. However, the role of this regulatory mechanism has not been evaluated clearly in DMD cardiomyocytes. In this present study, we evaluated myocardial fibrosis and its mechanism in mdx mice, a model of DMD, and also evaluated changes in cardiac function. As assessed by LC3 immunohistochemistry, a small number of autophagosomes were detected in cardiomyocytes of both mdx mice and control wild-type (WT) mice. The number of autophagosomes was significantly enhanced by 4 weeks of isoproterenol-induced cardiac stress in cardiomyocytes of mdx but not WT mice. Simultaneously, isoproterenol increased cardiomyocyte fibrosis in mdx but not WT mice. Administration of chloroquine significantly decreased cardiomyocyte fibrosis in mdx mice, even after isoproterenol treatment. Left ventricle size and function were evaluated by echocardiography. Left ventricular contraction was decreased in mdx mice after isoproterenol treatment compared with control mice, which was alleviated by chloroquine administration. Heart failure in DMD patients is possibly treated with chloroquine, and the mechanism probably involves chloroquine's anti-inflammatory effects."

Empirical data reveal a 10-fold increase in bioavailability and up to a 13-fold rise in focal tissue accumulation, alongside marked improvements in UAA incorporation efficiency. A 4-week oral administration in mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), demonstrates the formulation's unprecedented therapeutic potential, with up to 40% dystrophin expression restoration and 75% recovery of normal fiber functions, surpassing existing treatments and exhibiting substantial long-term safety. This study presents a potent oral dosage form that dramatically improves UAA incorporation into target proteins in vivo, offering a significant advance in the treatment of nonsense mutation-mediated disorders and holding considerable promise for clinical translation."

    "title": "<i>DMD</i> deletions underlining mild dystrophinopathies: literature review highlights phenotype-related mutation clusters and provides insights about genetic mechanisms and prognosis.",
    "abstract": "<i>DMD</i> gene pathogenic variations cause a spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the Becker milder cases, the intermediate or very mild muscle phenotypes invariably characterized by high CK, and the ultrarare fully-asymptomatic cases. Besides these phenotypes, X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy is also caused by <i>DMD</i> mutations. Males carrying <i>DMD</i> deletions with absent or very mild phenotypes have been sparsely described. We performed a horizon scan on public datasets to enroll males with the above phenotypes and carrying <i>DMD</i> deletions to delineate myopathic genotype-phenotype relationships. We inventoried 81 males, who were divided into the following clinical categorization: fully-asymptomatic males aged >43 years (A, <i>N</i> = 22); isolated hyperCKemia (CK, <i>N</i> = 35); and mild weakness (any age) with or without high CK (WCK, <i>N</i> = 24). In all cases, deleted intervals were exons 2 to 55, and no downstream exons were ever involved, apart from an exon 78 deletion in a WCK patient. All deletions were in-frame apart from the known exception to the rule of exon 2 and exon 78. We correlated the mild phenotypes (A and CK) to deleted exons, intronic breakpoints, exon-exon junctions, 3' isoforms rule, and protein epitopes, and we found that some genetic profiles are exclusively/mainly occurring in A/CK phenotypes, suggesting they are compatible with a <i>quasi</i>-normal muscular performance. We discussed diverse pathogenic mechanisms that may contribute to mild dystrophinopathic phenotypes, and we tried to address some \"critical\" genetic configurations or exon content needed to preserve a semi-functional <i>DMD</i> gene."

    "title": "AMONDYS 45 (Casimersen), a Novel Antisense Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer: Clinical Considerations for Treatment in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) is an antisense oligonucleotide therapy used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a mutation in the DMD gene. Symptoms include progressive muscle weakness, respiratory and cardiac complications, and premature death. Casimersen targets a specific mutation in the DMD gene that results in the absence of dystrophin protein, a key structural component of muscle fibers. While there is currently no cure for DMD, exon-skipping therapy works by restoring the reading frame of the mutated gene, allowing the production of a partially functional dystrophin protein. Clinical trials of casimersen have shown promising results in increasing dystrophin production, as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) droplets when compared to placebo. In a randomized double-blind trial, patients who received casimersen had significantly higher dystrophin levels when compared to those who received placebo. Casimersen therapy is administered through repeated intravenous infusions, although the optimal dosage and duration of treatment are still under investigation. Based on the completed and ongoing clinical trials, casimersen has been well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild and unrelated to casimersen. In 2021, AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Duchene muscular dystrophy in patients with a mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. These collective findings indicate that casimersen has the potential to elicit functional changes in individuals with DMD, although further studies are necessary to comprehensively evaluate the specific functional improvements. Regardless, the FDA approval and ongoing clinic trials mark a significant milestone in the development of DMD treatments and offer hope for those affected by this debilitating disease."

    "title": "Characterization of CD90/Thy-1 as a crucial molecular signature for myogenic differentiation in human urine-derived cells through single-cell RNA sequencing.",
    "abstract": "Human urine-derived cells (UDCs) are primary cultured cells originating from the upper urinary tract and are known to be multipotent. We previously developed MYOD1-transduced UDCs (MYOD1-UDCs) as a model recapitulating the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) caused by a lack of dystrophin. MYOD1-UDCs also allow evaluation of the efficacy of exon skipping with antisense oligonucleotides. However, despite the introduction of MYOD1, some MYOD1-UDCs failed to form myotubes, possibly because of heterogeneity among UDCs. Here, we carried out single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses and revealed that CD90/Thy-1 was highly expressed in a limited subpopulation of UDCs with high myogenic potency. Furthermore, CD90-positive MYOD1-UDCs, but not CD90-negative cells, could form myotubes expressing high levels of myosin heavy chain and dystrophin. Notably, overexpression of CD90 in CD90-negative MYOD1-UDCs did not enhance myogenic differentiation, whereas CD90 suppression in CD90-positive UDCs led to decreased myotube formation and decreased myosin heavy chain expression. CD90 may thus contribute to the fusion of single-nucleated MYOD1-UDCs into myotubes but is not crucial for promoting the expression of late muscle regulatory factors. Finally, we confirmed that CD90-positive MYOD1-UDCs derived from patients with DMD were a valuable tool for obtaining a highly reproducible and stable evaluation of exon skipping using antisense oligonucleotide."

    "title": "Different bone health progression patterns and early-stage risk marker in glucocorticoid-treated ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
    "abstract": "Fractures often cause irreversible harm in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study investigated the trajectory of bone mineral density (BMD) using group-based trajectory modeling and identified that BMD acts as an early-stage indicator of clinically significant bone fragility. The greater the early-stage BMD, the better the 4-year bone health outcome. Most Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) children suffer bone loss after long-term glucocorticoid (GC) exposure, which induces scoliosis and fragility fractures. To assess the BMD progression pattern and individual medical risk markers for these phenotypes in young ambulatory boys with DMD, and provide evidence-based suggestions for clinical management of bone health. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 153 boys with DMD in West China Second University Hospital (2016-2023) was performed. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to study the BMD progression pattern, and potential predictors were further analyzed by logistic regression and survival analysis. One hundred and fifty-three participants were included, 71 of which had more than 3 BMD records. Three BMD trajectories were identified. Baseline BMD and age-started GC and were independent predictors of trajectory attribution. The median survival time of the first observation of low BMD in GC-treated DMD boys was 5.32 (95% CI 4.05-6.59) years, and a significant difference was tested (P < 0.001) among the three trajectory groups. BMD may serve as a novel early indicating marker for monitoring bone fragility for DMD. We proposed a bone health risk stratification through BMD progression trajectory that allows us to adapt the osteoporosis warning sign in DMD from a fixed threshold approach to a more individualized strategy, where baseline BMD and age of glucocorticoid initiation can provide an earlier prediction of bone loss. Better management of primary BMD may be able to delay or avoid the onset of adverse bone health outcomes in the fifth year in children with DMD."

    "title": "A phase 2 open-label study of the safety and efficacy of weekly dosing of ATL1102 in patients with non-ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy and pharmacology in mdx mice.",
    "abstract": "ATL1102 is a 2'MOE gapmer antisense oligonucleotide to the CD49d alpha subunit of VLA-4, inhibiting expression of CD49d on lymphocytes, reducing survival, activation and migration to sites of inflammation. Children with DMD have dystrophin deficient muscles susceptible to contraction induced injury, which triggers the immune system, exacerbating muscle damage. CD49d is a biomarker of disease severity in DMD, with increased numbers of high CD49d expressing T cells correlating with more severe and progressive weakess, despite corticosteroid treatment. This Phase 2 open label study assessed the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of ATL1102 administered as 25 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection for 24 weeks in 9 non-ambulatory boys with DMD aged 10-18 years. The main objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ATL1102. Secondary objectives included the effect of ATL1102 on lymphocyte numbers in the blood, functional changes in upper limb function as assessed by Performance of Upper Limb test (PUL 2.0) and upper limb strength using MyoGrip and MyoPinch compared to baseline. Eight out of nine participants were on a stable dose of corticosteroids. ATL1102 was generally safe and well tolerated. No serious adverse events were reported. There were no participant withdrawals from the study. The most commonly reported adverse events were injection site erythema and skin discoloration. There was no statistically significant change in lymphocyte count from baseline to week 8, 12 or 24 of dosing however, the CD3+CD49d+ T lymphocytes were statistically significantly higher at week 28 compared to week 24, four weeks past the last dose (mean change 0.40x109/L 95%CI 0.05, 0.74; p = 0.030). Functional muscle strength, as measured by the PUL2.0, EK2 and Myoset grip and pinch measures, and MRI fat fraction of the forearm muscles were stable throughout the trial period. ATL1102, a novel antisense drug being developed for the treatment of inflammation that exacerbates muscle fibre damage in DMD, appears to be safe and well tolerated in non-ambulant boys with DMD. The apparent stabilisation observed on multiple muscle disease progression parameters assessed over the study duration support the continued development of ATL1102 for the treatment of DMD.

    "title": "Why is early-onset atrial fibrillation uncommon in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy? Insights from the mdx mouse.",
    "abstract": "A reduction in both dystrophin and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) secondary to microRNA-31 (miR-31) up-regulation contributes to the atrial electrical remodelling that underpins human and experimental atrial fibrillation (AF). In contrast, patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), who lack dystrophin and NOS1 and, at least in the skeletal muscle, have raised miR-31 expression, do not have increase susceptibility to AF in the absence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Here, we investigated whether dystrophin deficiency is also associated with atrial up-regulation of miR-31, loss of NOS1 protein, and increased AF susceptibility in young mdx mice. Echocardiography showed normal cardiac structure and function in 12-13 weeks mdx mice, with no indication by assay of hydroxyproline that atrial fibrosis had developed. The absence of dystrophin in mdx mice was accompanied by an overall reduction in syntrophin and a lower NOS1 protein content in the skeletal muscle and in the left atrial and ventricular myocardium, with the latter occurring alongside reduced Nos1 transcript levels (exons 1-2 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and an increase in NOS1 polyubiquitination [assessed using tandem polyubiquitination pulldowns; P < 0.05 vs. wild type (WT)]. Neither the up-regulation of miR-31 nor the substantial reduction in NOS activity observed in the skeletal muscle was present in the atrial tissue of mdx mice. At difference with the skeletal muscle, the mdx atrial myocardium showed a reduction in the constitutive NOS inhibitor, caveolin-1, coupled with an increase in NOS3 serine1177 phosphorylation, in the absence of differences in the protein content of other NOS isoforms or in the relative expression NOS1 splice variants. In line with these findings, transoesophageal atrial burst pacing revealed no difference in AF susceptibility between mdx mice and their WT littermates. Dystrophin depletion is not associated with atrial miR-31 up-regulation, reduced NOS activity, or increased AF susceptibility in the mdx mouse. Compared with the skeletal muscle, the milder atrial biochemical phenotype may explain why patients with DMD do not exhibit a higher prevalence of atrial arrhythmias despite a reduction in NOS1 content."

    "abstract": "The development of left ventricular (LV) remodeling has been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and cardiogenic death, and different patterns of remodeling result in varying levels of prognosis. To investigate the association between different patterns of LV remodeling and clinical outcomes in the preclinical stage of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A total of 148 patients with DMD and 43 sex- and age-matched healthy participants were enrolled. We used the four-quadrant analysis method to investigate LV remodeling based on cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to illustrate the event-free survival probability stratified by the LV remodeling pattern. Cox regression models were constructed and compared to evaluate the incremental predictive value of the LV remodeling pattern. During the median follow-up period of 2.2 years, all-cause death, cardiomyopathy, and ventricular arrhythmia occurred in 5, 35, and 7 patients, respectively. LV concentric hypertrophy (hazard ratio 2.91, 95% confidence interval 1.47-5.75, P=0.002) was an independent predictor of composite endpoint events. Compared to the model without LV concentric hypertrophy, the model with LV concentric hypertrophy had significant incremental predictive value (chi-square value 33.5 vs. 25.2, P=0.004). Age and late gadolinium enhancement positivity were positively correlated with clinical outcomes according to the prediction models. LV concentric hypertrophy was also an independent predictor for risk stratification and provided incremental value for predicting clinical outcomes in the preclinical stage of patients with DMD."

    "title": "Characteristics of Patients Receiving Novel Muscular Dystrophy Drugs in Trials vs Routine Care.",
    "abstract": "The US Food and Drug Administration approved eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in 2016 based on a controversial pivotal study that demonstrated a limited effect on the surrogate measure of dystrophin production. Other DMD treatments in the same class followed. To assess how patients receiving novel DMD treatments in postapproval clinical settings compare with patients in the clinical trials. This cross-sectional study collected data on patients who initiated 1 of 4 novel DMD treatments (eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen) using national claims databases of commercially insured (Merative MarketScan and Optum's Clinformatics Data Mart Database [CDM]) and Medicaid patients between September 19, 2016, and March 31, 2022. Patients were followed for 1 year after the date of first use of any novel DMD treatment. In addition, patients in pivotal DMD drug trials were identified for comparison. Age, sex, race and ethnicity, region, and DMD stage of patients receiving novel DMD treatment. The main outcome was health care costs and drug discontinuation as measured using descriptive statistics. A total of 223 routine care patients initiating novel DMD drugs (58 in MarketScan, 35 in CDM, and 130 in Medicaid) were identified. Among the 106 patients in the pivotal trials, the mean (SD) age was 8.5 (2.0) years (range, 4.0-13.0 years), which was younger than the mean age of patients in routine care (MarketScan: 13.7 [7.0] years [range, 1.8-33.3 years; P < .001]; CDM: 11.9 [5.7] years [range, 0.6-23.6 years; P < .001]; Medicaid: 13.4 [6.5] years [range, 1.8-46.1 years; P < .001]). The proportion of female patients identified in postapproval clinical settings was 2.9% (n = 1) in CDM (vs 34 male patients [97.1%]) and 1.5% (n = 2) in Medicaid (vs 128 male patients [98.5%]), which was not different from the pivotal trials. While nearly all patients in the pivotal trials had DMD disease stage 1 or 2 when initiating the DMD treatments (103 [97.2%]), in the postapproval clinical setting, slightly more than one-third of patients were in disease stage 3 or 4 (MarketScan, 17 [36.2%; P < .001]; CDM, 13 [41.9%; P < .001]; Medicaid, 54 [47.0%; P < .001]). The payer's cost for novel DMD treatments varied across the databases, with a mean (SD) of $634 764 ($607 101) in MarketScan, $482 749 ($582 350) in CDM, and $384 023 ($1 165 730) in Medicaid. Approximately one-third of routine care patients discontinued the treatments after approximately 7 months (mean [SD], 6.1 [4.4], 6.9 [3.9], and 7.2 [4.3] months in MarketScan, CDM, and Medicaid, respectively). These findings raise questions about the translation of DMD drug trial findings to routine care settings, with patients in routine care discontinuing the treatment within 1 year and payers incurring substantial expenses for these medications. More data are needed on whether these high costs are accompanied by corresponding clinical benefits."
